These Non-GAAP financial measures have\ncertain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the Company's definition may be different from similar Non-\nGAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. Thus it may be more difficult to\ncompare the Company's financial performance to that of other companies. However, the Company's management compensates for these\nlimitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these Non-GAAP financial measures both in its\nreconciliation to the U.S. GAAP financial measures and its condensed consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered\nwhen evaluating the Company's results.\nThe Company uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the information provided in its condensed consolidated financial\nstatements, which are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be a\nsubstitute for financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a\nsupplement to such U.S. GAAP measures. OpenText strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to\nrely on a single financial measure. The Company therefore believes that despite these limitations, it is appropriate to supplement the\ndisclosure of the U.S. GAAP measures with certain Non-GAAP measures defined below.\nNon-GAAP-based net income and Non-GAAP-based EPS, attributable to OpenText, are consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income\n(loss) or earnings (loss) per share, attributable to OpenText, on a diluted basis, excluding the effects of the amortization of acquired intangible\nassets, other income (expense), share-based compensation, and special charges (recoveries), all net of tax and any tax benefits/expense items\nunrelated to current period income, as further described in the tables below. Non-GAAP-based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of GAAP-\nbased gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets and share-based compensation within cost of sales.\nNon-GAAP-based gross margin is calculated as Non-GAAP-based gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP-based\nincome from operations is calculated as GAAP-based income from operations, excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets,\nspecial charges (recoveries), and share-based compensation expense.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is consistently calculated as GAAP-based net\nincome (loss), attributable to OpenText, excluding interest income (expense), provision for (recovery of) income taxes, depreciation and\namortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation and special charges (recoveries). Adjusted\nEBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of total revenue.\nThe Company's management believes that the presentation of the above defined Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information\nto investors because they portray the financial results of the Company before the impact of certain non-operational charges. The use of the\nterm “non-operational charge” is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the\nCompany's management. These items are excluded based upon the way the Company's management evaluates the performance of the\nCompany's business for use in the Company's internal reports and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and therefore believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures, which\nin certain cases adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions,\nwill provide readers of financial statements with a more consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and be more useful in\nhelping readers understand the Company’s operating results and underlying operational trends. Additionally, the Company has engaged in\nvarious restructuring activities over the past several years, primarily due to acquisitions and in response to our return to office planning, that\nhave resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs, all which are recorded\nunder the Company’s “Special charges (recoveries)” caption on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Each restructuring activity is a\ndiscrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each differs in terms of its operational implementation,\nbusiness impact and scope, and the size of each restructuring plan can vary significantly from period to period. Therefore, the Company\nbelieves that the exclusion of these special charges (recoveries) will also better aid readers of financial statements in the understanding and\ncomparability of the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.\nIn summary, the Company believes the provision of supplemental Non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the operational and\nfinancial performance of the Company's core business using the same evaluation measures that management uses, and is therefore a useful\nindication of OpenText's performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period-to-period comparison of operating\nperformance (although prior performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance). As a result, the Company considers it\nappropriate and reasonable to provide, in addition to U.S. GAAP measures, supplementary Non-GAAP financial measures that exclude\ncertain items from the presentation of its financial results. Information reconciling certain forward-looking GAAP measures to non-GAAP\nmeasures related to F'25 targets and F’27 aspirations, including A-EBITDA is not available without unreasonable effort due to high\nvariability, complexity and uncertainty with respect to forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations.\n11\nThe following charts provide unaudited reconciliations of U.S. GAAP-based financial measures to Non-GAAP-based financial measures for\nthe following periods presented. The Micro Focus Acquisition significantly impacts period-over-period comparability.\n12\nReconciliation of selected GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024\n(In thousands, except for per share data)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNon-GAAP-\nGAAP-based\nbased\nMeasures Non-GAAP-\nMeasures\nGAAP-based % of Total based\n% of Total\nMeasures Revenue Adjustments Note Measures\nRevenue\nCost of revenues\nCloud services and subscriptions $ 175,257 ($2,186) (1) $ 173,071\nCustomer support 62,574 (1,342) (1) 61,232\nProfessional service and other 66,915 (1,314) (1) 65,601\nAmortization of acquired technology-based intangible\nassets 47,244 (47,244) (2) —\nGAAP-based gross profit and gross margin (%) /\nNon-GAAP-based gross profit and gross margin\n910,358 71.7% 52,086 (3) 962,444 75.8%\n(%)\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development 190,693 (8,167) (1) 182,526\nSales and marketing 245,882 (9,315) (1) 236,567\nGeneral and administrative 106,730 (7,234) (1) 99,496\nAmortization of acquired customer-based intangible\nassets 81,504 (81,504) (2) —\nSpecial charges (recoveries) 47,136 (47,136) (4) —\nGAAP-based income from operations / Non-GAAP-\n206,242 205,442 (5) 411,684\nbased income from operations\nOther income (expense), net (35,655) 35,655 (6) —\nProvision for income taxes 1,883 76,693 (7) 78,576\nGAAP-based net income / Non-GAAP-based net\n84,368 164,404 (8) 248,772\nincome, attributable to OpenText\nGAAP-based earnings per share / Non-GAAP-based\nearnings per share-diluted, attributable to\n$ 0.32 $ 0.61 (8) $ 0.93\nOpenText\n(1) Adjustment relates to the exclusion of share-based compensation expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses\nas this expense is excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\n(2) Adjustment relates to the exclusion of amortization expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as the timing\nand frequency of amortization expense is dependent on our acquisitions and is hence excluded from our internal analysis\nof operating results.\n(3) GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based gross profit stated in dollars and gross margin stated as a percentage of total\nrevenue.\n(4) Adjustment relates to the exclusion of special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as\nspecial charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include certain charges or\nrecoveries that are not indicative or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis\nof operating results.\n(5) GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based income from operations stated in dollars.\n(6) Adjustment relates to the exclusion of other income (expense) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as other\nincome (expense) generally relates to the transactional impact of foreign exchange and is generally not indicative or\nrelated to continuing operations and is therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.

OpenText ©2024 All rights reserved 17\n(2) Individual line items in tables may be adjusted by non-material amounts to enable totals to align to published financial statements.\nAppendix A\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S.GAAP, the Company provides certain financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP).These Non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in\nthat they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the Company's definition may be different from similar Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. Thus it may be more\ndifficult to compare the Company's financial performance to that of other companies. However, the Company's management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these\nNon-GAAP financial measures both in its reconciliation to the U.S.GAAP financial measures and its consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's results. Reconciliations of Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures for future periods are not provided as the Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliations.\nThe Company uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the information provided in its consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures is\nnot meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with U.S.GAAP, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such U.S.GAAP measures. OpenText strongly encourages investors to\nreview its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. The Company therefore believes that despite these limitations, it is appropriate to supplement the disclosure of the U.S.GAAP measures with certain Non-\nGAAP measures defined below.\nNon-GAAP-based net income and Non-GAAP-based EPS, attributable to OpenText, are consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income(loss) or earnings (loss) per share, attributable to OpenText, on a diluted basis, excluding the effects of\nthe amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation, and special charges (recoveries), all net of tax and any tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income, as further described in the\ntables below. Non-GAAP-based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of GAAP-based gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets and share-based compensation within cost of sales. Non-GAAP-based gross\nmargin is calculated as Non-GAAP-based gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP-based income from operations is calculated as GAAP-based income from operations, excluding the amortization of acquired intangible\nassets, special charges (recoveries), and share-based compensation expense.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income (loss), attributable to OpenText, excluding interest income (expense), provision for (recovery of)\nincome taxes, depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation and special charges (recoveries). Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA expressed as a\npercentage of total revenue.\nThe Company's management believes that the presentation of the above defined Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because they portray the financial results of the Company before the impact of certain non-\noperational charges. The use of the term “non-operational charge” is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impactthe ongoing operating decisions taken by the Company's management. These items are excluded based upon the\nway the Company's management evaluates the performance of the Company's business for use in the Company's internal reports and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and therefore believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures, which in certain cases adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects\nthat are primarily related to acquisitions, will provide readers of financial statements with a more consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and be more useful in helping readers understand the Company’s operating results and\nunderlying operational trends. Additionally, the Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years, primarily due to acquisitions and in response to our return to office planning, that have resulted in costs\nassociated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs, all which are recorded under the Company’s “Special charges (recoveries)” caption on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Each restructuring activity\nis a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each differs in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope, and the size of each restructuring plan can vary significantly from period to\nperiod. Therefore, the Company believes that the exclusion of these special charges (recoveries) will also better aid readersoffinancial statements in the understanding and comparability of the Company's operating results and underlying\noperational trends.\nIn summary, the Company believes the provision of supplemental Non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the operational andfinancial performance of the Company's core business using the same evaluation measures that management\nuses, and is therefore a useful indication of OpenText's performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period-to-period comparison of operating performance (although prior performance is not necessarily indicative of\nfuture performance). As a result, the Company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide, in addition to U.S.GAAP measures, supplementary Non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial\nresults.\nSee historical filings, including the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, for reconciliations of certain Non-GAAP measures toGAAP measures. The following charts provide unaudited reconciliations of U.S.GAAP-based financial measures\nto Non-GAAP-based financial measures for the following periods presented. Information reconciling certain forward-looking GAAP measures to Non-GAAP measures related to F'24 targets and F'26 aspirations, including adjusted EBITDA is not\navailable without unreasonable effort due to high variability, complexity and uncertainty with respect to forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations.\nOpenText ©2024 All rights reserved 18\nSummary of Quarterly Results with Constant Currency\nQ1 FY'25 % Change\n(In millions U.S. dollars, except per share data) Q1 FY'25 Q1 FY'24 $ Change % Change in CC* in CC*\nRevenues:\nCloud services and subscriptions $457.0 $451.0 $6.0 1.3 % $458.7 1.7 %\nCustomer support 595.5 697.7 (102.2) (14.7) % 598.0 (14.3) %\nTotal annual recurring revenues** $1,052.5 $1,148.7 $(96.2) (8.4) % $1,056.7 (8.0) %\nLicense 125.8 173.0 (47.2) (27.3) % 125.9 (27.2) %\nProfessional service and other 90.7 103.7 (13.0) (12.5) % 90.7 (12.5) %\nTotal revenues $1,269.0 $1,425.4 $(156.4) (11.0) % $1,273.2 (10.7) %\nGAAP-based operating income $206.2 $212.9 ($6.7) (3.1) % N/A N/A\nNon-GAAP-based operating income (1) $411.7 $460.8 ($49.1) (10.7) % $410.2 (11.0) %\nGAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText $84.4 $80.9 $3.5 4.3 % N/A N/A\nGAAP-based EPS, diluted $0.32 $0.30 $0.02 6.7 % N/A N/A\nNon-GAAP-based EPS, diluted (1) (2) $0.93 $1.01 ($0.08) (7.9) % $0.93 (7.9) %\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) $443.8 $494.8 ($51.0) (10.3) % $442.3 (10.6) %\nOperating cash flows ($77.8) $47.1 ($124.9) (265.1) % N/A N/A\nFree cash flows (1) $(117.1) $9.6 ($126.7) (1,322.3) % N/A N/A\n(1) See reconciliation of GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures at the end of this presentation.\n(2) For periods prior to Fiscal 2025, this is reflective of the amount of net tax benefit arising from the internal reorganization assumed to be allocable to the period based on the forecasted utilization period.

Other income (expense) also includes our share of income (losses) from our holdings in\n6 investments as a limited partner. We do not actively trade equity securities in these privately held companies nor do we plan our ongoing operations based around any anticipated fundings or distributions from these\ninvestments. We exclude gains and losses on these investments as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results. Other income (expense) also includes unrealized and realized\ngains (losses) on our derivatives which are not designated as hedges. We exclude gains and losses on these derivatives as we do not believe they are reflective on our ongoing business and operating results.\nAdjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 2% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate ofapproximately 24%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items\nthat are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net.

Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves, and “book to return” adjustments\n7\nfor tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the\nforecasted utilization period.

Reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures\nto their most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found within our public filings and the other materials, which are available on our website.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark.\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nThank you, Greg, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. Let me start with in Q1, we delivered to our revenue quarterly factors as well as exceeded\nexpectations in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We grew our adjusted EBITDA percent year-over-year to 35%, and this growth comes from\nsustained efficiency gains even after the divestiture of the ultra-high-margin AMC business. Over the last two quarters, we purchased and canceled\n7.72 million shares at an average price of $30.43, expect us to continue purchasing our shares. And in Q2, I'm deeply excited about our momentum.\nWe are strengthening our competitive advantage with Titanium X, our next-generation autonomous information management platform powered\nby AI and security, coupled with strong investments we are making in our enterprise and SMB go-to-market, strategic partners and customer\nsuccess organizations, all of which leads us to a stronger second half of the fiscal year. Further, we are reaffirming our fiscal ‘25 targets and our\nouter year aspirations.\nOn to Q1. Our Q1 results include delivering $1.27 billion in revenues well within our quarterly factor range of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion. Q1 is a\nseasonally lower quarter, yet it was the largest Q1 of enterprise cloud bookings in our history, up 10% year-over-year and up 53% over three years.\nAs it relates to our cloud business, Q1 marked our 15th consecutive quarter of organic growth of $457 million or revenues up 1.2%, of 1.3%, and\nwe expect this to ramp throughout the year. We also had strong customer wins at Raytheon, FedEx, Virgin Mobile, Alaska Airlines, Nippon Gas, the\nEuropean Medicines Agency and Dick's Sporting Goods across content, business network, digital operations and security.\nFinancial services, technology, public sector, health care and biotech and consumer packaged goods were top industries for our book of business.\nRevenue by GEO, Americas, 57% with the majority in the United States; EMEA, 33% and APAC and Japan, 10%. We had 38 deals over $1 million,\nthe majority being cloud-based deals. We had 20 wins related to our GenAI Aviator offering. We keep building strength and progress every 90 days,\nmore aviators, more agents, easier to use and less expense to operate.\nWe see AI as a long-term opportunity and a key priority for the company. Net cloud renewal rate of 94% and of course, adjusted EBITDA of 35%,\nwhich is year-over-year percent growth inclusive of the AMC business. This is incredible progress and reflects our deep focus on capturing the large\nmargin opportunity ahead of us and adjusted EPS of $0.93, well above expectations.\nLooking ahead into Q2, we expect total revenues of $1.29 billion to $1.34 billion, supported by a strong pipeline and customer engagement,\ncontinued adjusted EBITDA strength of 34% to 35%, continued enterprise booking strength ramping towards our annual target of 25% growth,\nand Madhu will expand on our outlook here in a few moments.\nQ2 is a tougher year-over-year compare, given the large AMC contribution and the license revenue from grants of certain IP rights in Q2 of last\nyear. The business is executing well. And as I kicked off the call saying we are reaffirming today our fiscal '25 targets of total revenues of $5.3 billion\nto $5.4 billion, that's $100 million spread ex-AMC, this is constant to 1% growth.\nAnnual adjusted EBITDA of 33% to 34%, free cash flow of $575 million to $625 million, and we're on track to return approximately $570 million of\ncapital via our dividend and share buyback programs. It will be a record year of capital return for OpenText.\n3\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Second\nfactor, realizing our new go-to-market investments led by Todd in the sales organization; third factor, expanding partner contribution led by Sandy\nOno and our fourth factor, realizing our new customer service investments led by Paul in the renewals, professional services and customer success\nteams.\nLet me expand on these drivers more and how they point to a stronger second half. First, our competitive advantage clearly gets stronger with\nTitanium X or Cloud Editions 25.2 and we are on track for the final delivery in the second half of this fiscal year. Information is the heartbeat of every\norganization.\nIt flows through every process, every workflow, every innovation, every experience. It touches all roles. It enables the modern organization. Titanium\nX will elevate our customers' capabilities in significant ways. OpenText World 2024 November will bring this all to life, and we hope to see you\nthere.\nAs a preview, customers and partners will see key differentiation and compelling reasons to adopt the new Titanium X. First, a modern SaaS platform\nfor our core information solutions. So as I'd like to say, everything downstream of SaaS is goodness. It's faster time to revenue, it's easier to expand\ncapabilities and it's higher margin. Second key piece, a private cloud that is global, secure, trusted and autonomous.\nAnd we've obviously made significant progress here over the last few years. And once in our private cloud, we keep customers current on the latest\nversion, latest security and the latest AI. So customers are free to run their business and elevate their -- and evaluate our new innovations we provide\nevery 90 days.\nThird is our compelling new capabilities in each of our business clouds. For example, in the content world and content cloud, it's all about SaaS, AI\nand integrated security and deep integration into business applications. In our business network, it's about being global, global supply chain,\nglobal e-invoicing, a global supply chain control tower that can see across all your suppliers, the new traceability applications from being able to\ndetermine cobalt field in Africa to finished electric vehicles in Germany as an example.\nSecurity. We are delivering a full stack of protection from users, applications, e-mail, network and cloud. We call it XDR as a Service. Titanium X is a\nmajor step forward for enterprise and SMB security a composable approach in the cloud to identify, detect and respond against active threats. We\nwill demonstrate our next-generation as a service at OpenText World. Security trust compliance is a major investment area for OpenText.\nOther compelling areas, ITOM, discovery and observability at our new corporate help desk expanding to include HR IT and all internal CXO\norganizations into one unified corporate health desk, all focused on elevating the employee experience.\nADM, we're introducing, dev sec ops for large-scale software organizations. And at SMB, we are already live on our next-generation secure cloud\nplatform for the partner community to easily transact as you may have seen some of our social media last week and going live in Secure Cloud.\nAnd then lastly, Wave 2 GenAI aviators, built for every industry and embedded everywhere in OpenText software. Titanium X will have 15 aviators\nand over 100 agents. As we like to say, never bring a human to do the work of a machine. We'll be announcing support for Microsoft CoPilot in\naddition to Google Vertex and BYOM, Bring Your Own Language models into our private cloud.\nSo you'll see all of this at OpenText World 2024. It's a packed agenda of innovation and the value that comes at the right time for our customers in\nOpenText -- for OpenText to bring this all together for them in a powerful way. I hope to see you there at OpenText World.\nNext, let me expand on our new go-to-market investments led by Todd Cione in the sales organization. As mentioned in our last earnings call,\nwe're making investments in our go-to-market across three priority areas: people, customers and innovation. On people, we continue to find much\nsuccess attracting new sales talent.\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

In addition, our new unified global sales organization structure has allowed us to launch unified\nprograms to the entire organization on a global basis, all within this dynamic marketplace of cloud AI and security. And the first program we've\nlaunched is cross-selling security across all of our AI, and particularly important with our new XDR as a service coming out.\nOpenText always puts customers first and we are finding very strong momentum and engagement. Our cloud AI pipeline is the largest it's ever\nbeen and up 20% year-over-year. On sales innovation, we have deployed internally OpenText AI. We're now live. We call it Ollie.ai to act as a sales\nAviator for the sales force.\nI'll be demoing live, our new Ollie.ai tool at OpenText World and how we are using Aviators internally to generate proposals, accelerate sales velocity\nand win more. We are seeing very favorable impact in our sellers' ability to build effective account plans, articulate value propositions and build\ncompelling business cases now live on OpenText AI.\nThird, in support of a strong second half -- stronger second half as moving on to expanding partner contribution. The demand signals for information\nmanagement are strong. Our customers see the growing availability of business AI for many places and including the importance of effective\ninformation management solutions. You need strong data management to have strong AI. I've talked about how we help companies operate in\nthe world of the Internet of disconnected clouds.\nYou'll hear at OpenText, our next big steps in this area on how OpenText makes multi-cloud work. You see all enterprise customers have many\ncloud providers. This is the new normal. I can't meet a customer; I can't find a customer only has one cloud provider. Our customers have many\ncloud providers, and no customer standardizes just on one cloud provider. So further, customers will have multiple AI suppliers as well. It is a\nmulti-cloud world.\nWe see a growing role for OpenText, where we make multi-cloud work for one source of truth for data, user authentication across all these systems,\nworkflow across all the clouds, search across all the clouds, governance across all these clouds. We make multi-cloud work.\nIn achieving this, our strategic partnerships are more important than ever, and at all layers of the enterprise stack from the app layer to infrastructure,\nto security and to the supply chain. For example, on SAP, we continue to work closely to remain day one current across all their amazing cloud\nsolutions.\nOn Google, we've expanded our support to improve their full AI stack and services. On Microsoft, we've expanded our partnership to now include\nCopilot for security. We continue to work with Salesforce that our business clouds work in tandem with their business clouds.\nTitanium X has integrations across content security and ITOM for Salesforce. We recently added Content Cloud for Guidewire to expand our presence\nin the insurance industry and for Amazon, our business network better integrates and leverages their commerce platform. We'll continue to foster\nour strategic partnerships to ensure OpenText solutions are at the center of the multi-cloud world. We make multi-cloud work.\nAnd then finally, in support of a stronger second half, while we will increasingly see returns on our customer success investments. On our last call,\nwe told you, we informed, that we would be building a new digital renewal center and going live July 1, and we went live, July 1. We'll continue to\ntake humans out of the renewal process.\nAnd in doing so, our business scales with lower friction, lower cost, and our best people can help our customers expand consumption. This team\nhad an incredible first quarter and exceeded our expectations. So a lot more to follow in this particular area.\nI'd like to conclude with two items. First, join us at OpenText World and see the momentum we see and engage with our customers, partners,\nleadership and product teams directly. My Tuesday keynote will center on demonstrating Titanium X with AI embedded everywhere as well as our\nnew security and multi-cloud capabilities.\nWe have over 150 sessions and speakers describing how they are using our business clouds, business AI and business technologies, including\nsecurity. See how customers are redefining their relationship with their data, staying secure in the age of increasing cyber attacks and what's needed\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

We also have a special investor analyst track that Greg can sign you up for, so feel free to reach\nout to Greg or the IR team.\nSecond comment in conclusion is we have a strong belief in our four-point strategy to create shareholder value. Strengthening our competitive\nadvantage, accelerating cloud growth, capturing the large margin opportunity in front of us and strong capital returns via cash flow expansion,\ndividends and share buybacks. Of course, these three factor -- these four factors assume stable externalities and positive economic drivers. We\ncontinue to monitor the economies in Europe, North America, APAC and Japan and we're prepared to adjust our approach if we need to.\nThe team is focused on delivering to our F25 targets, building a strong, longer-term business and creating value for all our stakeholders. Our\nfundamentals remain strong. Demand is there, and we have the innovation our customers need. This is a winning strategy, and we see our path\nvery clearly today.\nWith that, I'd like to thank you for joining us today, and may the one that brings peace, bring peace for all. I'd like to turn the call over to Madhu.\nMadhu Ranganathan - Open Text Corp - President, CFO and Corporate Development\nThank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. Please refer to the IR materials posted on our website. During Q1, we executed very well\non our operational efficiencies and exceeded our plan to bring operating leverage to the P&L. We are committed to delivering on operational\nefficiencies. And in Q1, we led with higher adjusted EBITDA performance and delivering 35% adjusted EBITDA in Q1, excluding the impact of\nultra-high-margin AMC business is a significant achievement.\nNow turning to the numbers. I will share where relevant year-over-year comparison, excluding the impact of AMC divestiture. Our Q1 results reflect\ntypical seasonality we experienced in the September quarter. Q1 total revenue of $1.269 billion was down 11% or down 1.8% when adjusted for\nAMC divestiture. Q1 cloud revenue was $457 million, up 1.3%.\nOur cloud business continues to exhibit strong performance with bookings of $133.5 million, up 10.3%. ARR of $1.0525 billion was down 8.4% and\ndown 1.1% when adjusted for the AMC divestiture. ARR percentage of total revenues was approximately 82.9%. Customer support was down 3%\nwhen adjusted for the AMC divestiture.\nAnd moving to other financial metrics. GAAP net income was $84.4 million or $0.32 diluted EPS, up 6.7% year-over-year. GAAP gross margin of\n71.7% was up from 71.4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.8% compared to 77.3%. It reflects the AMC divestiture and continued\ninvestment in AI, global security and in our global cloud infrastructure. Adjusted EBITDA of $443.8 million or 35%, as mentioned earlier, it reflects\nour extreme operational focus during the quarter.\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.93, down 7.9%, also due to the impact of AMC divestiture. Our overall working capital performance remained strong\nwith our DSOs at 42 days, a decrease of 1 day from 43 days in the last quarter. We reported negative $77.8 million in operating cash flows and\nnegative $117.1 million free cash flows in the quarter, and these reflect the one-time tax payment on the gain relating to the AMC divestiture\nincluded in our Form 10-Q is the total cash payments during the quarter at $240 million.\nOur GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 2%, and that reflects expiry of certain -- of certain uncertain tax positions due to statute limitations, some\nonetime acquisition charges and accruals, such factors are unique to Q1. We expect our annual GAAP tax rate to be in the mid-teens of fiscal 2025.\nAs we communicated during our last earnings call, today, you will see in our filings that we defined and standardized on net renewal rate, or NRR,\nwhich is a better reflection of our cloud -- of our business as it now includes the expansion and impact driven by customers who renew and migrate\nto the cloud.\nNow moving to outlook. First, let me draw your attention to our Q2 quarterly factors included in slide 9 of our financial results and target presentations,\nand I will add to Mark's comments. We expect $1.29 billion to $1.34 billion of total revenue and ARR of $1.025 billion to $1.055 billion.\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

We maintain an incredible focus on cost to continue\ncapturing our large margin opportunity. We're targeting adjusted EBITDA margin of 34% to 35% during Q2.\nIn today's call, our second half of the year commentaries are very important for all of you to note. We expect stronger momentum in revenues and\ncloud bookings during the second half of this fiscal year and a seasonally strong Q4 for all the reasons outlined by Mark earlier.\nAnd with respect to expenses, we will continue to invest in our people as we experienced record retention and low attrition rates. As you all have\nseen in the past, our second half expenses will be higher than the first half. Starting in Q3, specifically in January, we expect higher cost due to\nannual employee merit increases, typical calendar year benefit cost uplifts and vacation accruals.\nI will recall Mark's earlier comments, we are making investments in our go-to-market across three priority areas: people, customers and innovation.\nWe have much success in attracting new sales talent, and we expect to maintain our capacity targets in sales, account executives and solution\nconsultants.\nSo with all of that, we have factored strong second half business momentum in revenues and cloud bookings as well as the additional spend and\ninvestments into our fiscal '25 targets, which I will summarize shortly and also included in slides 10 and 11 of our investor presentation.\nSo cloud revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion, annual recurring revenue of $4.25 billion to $4.30 billion. Total revenues between $5.3 billion and\n$5.4 billion, which is constant to 1% growth, excluding AMC. Adjusted EBITDA margin range at 33% to 34%. As a reminder, in August, we raised\nour adjusted EBITDA outlook for fiscal '25, up 100 basis points to the 33% to 34% range. We are well positioned to meet our adjusted EBITDA targets.\nAs a reminder, our 2025 adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the mid-20s. Free cash flows of $575 million to $625 million. And let me now summarize\nour path to grow adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow during fiscal '25 on an annual basis. We are experts in driving meticulous expense management\non a global scale, and that is what we're focused on.\nAnd regarding cloud revenue growth, future margin expansion will be driven by higher revenues, including more SaaS. We will deliver in the cloud\nwith lower cloud cost and more cloud automation. For the full year fiscal '25, we expect non-GAAP cloud gross margins in the low 60s.\nWe are beginning to leverage AI internally. Our business optimization plan we announced earlier to locate great talent in the right places is going\nwell. Higher EBITDA will directly support free cash flow growth given the strides we've made on working capital and efficient capital expenditures,\ndriving what we expect to be the highest return of capital to shareholders in OpenText's history during fiscal '25.\nAs we have communicated our four-point strategy to create shareholder value, capturing the large margin opportunity and cash flow expansion,\nthey remain front and center. Our strong efforts during the last 2 fiscal years is paying off. Our efforts continued in Q1, posting 35% adjusted EBITDA\nin Q1, which is better than the last year, even after the divestiture of high-margin AMC business.\nThe decisions we make today, alongside programs and projects to deploy will set us up well beyond fiscal '25 into fiscal '26 and '27. We remain on\ntarget for fiscal '25, have momentum towards meeting our long-term aspirations, and we intend to update you annually on fiscal '26 and '27.\nOn behalf of OpenText, I would like to thank our shareholders, our loyal customers and partners for your continued support and always big thanks\nto Team OpenText. We look forward to seeing you in person at OpenText World in November. I will now request the operator to open the call for\nyour questions.\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess I just want to start a little bit on kind of maybe the demand environment and the macro\nand what you're seeing out there. I guess, was there maybe any shift in deals? Are you seeing anything kind of get pushed off and maybe gives a\nlittle bit more confidence in that -- in the second half that maybe is impacting things in the first half would be great to get a little bit more detail\non what it is that's maybe going on out there in the deal environment?\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nYeah. Very good. And good morning, Steven, thanks for joining the call. We're here in California as well. So early start to the day. Thanks for joining.\nThe demand environment is stable. Even though I called out, we're going to continue to monitor the volatility in the world. We see demand as\nstable. The drivers for us are all point towards a stronger second half.\nWe have the largest release of our software and cloud in the history of the company coming up, Titanium X, or Cloud Editions 25.2. We've been\nout kind of well chronicling and well demoing, all the steady capabilities we've been adding. So directly to your question, we see the demand\nenvironment stable, so we're monitoring it as everyone else is. We have a very large innovation push that's going to drive demand for us in the\nsecond half.\nWe've just gone live on our new SMB platform that I highlighted we used was Project El Dorado, which is now live on Secure Cloud, which went\nlive last week. And we got a big product upgrade in security, XDR as a Service. We have significant step-ups in ITOM from our Micro Focus acquisition,\nand we have a very large SaaS push coming with Titanium X. And everything downstream of SaaS is just goodness. It's faster time to revenue,\nhigher margin and easier to expand for us.\nAnd as we noted, we have a tougher compare in Q2. It's a high quarter for AMC, and we have our one-time royalty from certain IP grants from a\nyear ago. So demand is stable. We're executing well, and we're looking for a stronger second half.\nSteven Enders - Citigroup Inc - Analyst\nOkay. That's helpful context there. I guess just a quick clarification. Just the -- can you remind us what the IP right impact is for 2Q that would be\nembedded in that comp? And then I guess secondarily, just think about the second half and the execution that needs to go into that, I guess, are\nthere certain things that you're seeing on either the deal environment or go-to-market investments that you are making that gives you that\nconfidence in the line of sight to the pipeline, the ability to kind of close on that for the second half?\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nYeah. I mean, I'll take the second part first, which is the two things, the things that give us confidence are as we highlighted in the script, we're on\ntrack for delivery at Titanium X. On our people side on the sales force, we're at capacity. As I noted in the script, it's just an incredible thing.\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

I also noted that our pipeline is up 20%\nfor the second half year-over-year, which is very tangible. So we're at capacity. Our pipeline is up. We have a product release. And we're also now\nlive on AI internally.\nWe're going to demo at OpenText World, so Ollie.ai, where we're enabling our new hires and our experts in the sales force to what could take a\ncouple of weeks to build proposals, we can now generate out of content management. So we think that's going to increase our response velocity\nin our win rates. So those are some very tangible things, Steve.\nIn relation to the grant of certain IP rights, [is as we chronicled] last year, we didn't talk about the quantum because we're always in the business\nof IP. And secondly, the nature of this particular item, there were a confidential -- confidentiality aspects. So we have no new disclosure from last\nyear, and we didn't disclose the quantum last year.\nSteven Enders - Citigroup Inc - Analyst\nThanks. All right. Well, I appreciate the context there and thanks again for taking the questions this morning.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nBilly Fitzsimmons - Jefferies Group LLC - Analyst\nHey, everyone. This is Billy Fitzsimmons, on for Samad. Maybe first for you, Mark. You may have talked about it in the prepared remarks, I may have\nmissed it, but it's been a couple of quarters now since Project [Athena] was announced, would be curious if you have any updates on progress thus\nfar? And maybe going a step further, is there any anecdotes around early efficiency gains or early internal feedback from employees as you can\nimplement these changes?\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nYeah. Very good. Thanks, Billy. Thanks for your question. We had kicked off a handful of initiatives. One what I just talked about, right, which is\nOllie.ai. I can't wait to show you at OpenText World. It's going to be main stage. We're going to have our sales force on stage, showing how we are\nusing 10 years of data to enable our sales force to auto-generate proposals. Imagine an AE who's doing a FedRAMP proposal who's new to the\ncompany, and it were all my FedRAMP solutions, what's the best presentations.\nHere are three questions, produce me a stellar generated response to give to my client. We're live on that now. And it's just going to keep getting\nbetter and better as we tune it. So the early feedback is very positive on that. Project Athena, which is for developers.\nSo Ollie.ai is for our sales force and support and Athena is for our developers. So we expect with 25.2 to generate our first applications. And those\napps will be generated on top of all our API services. So we call our API layer -- our strategy is to build apps and to deliver APIs.\nOn the APIs, we're going to generate software on top of those APIs. And that's what Athena is going to do. And we'll have our first production apps\nby 25.2 for April of next year. We're just four, five months away. And the early feedback is fantastic. What APIs, how do I use them?\nWhat are kind of the templates to generate simple things. They had to upload a file. How do I build a screen? How do I do security? So Athena, in\nits first generation of software is focused on basic apps, is focused on language translation. We deliver our product now put into the 40, localize it\nacross 40 countries and generate the documentation.\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

And it's working right in the areas where we thought we could, which\nis app generation, localization and documentation. And that's a wave 1 for us for developer experience productivity.\nBilly Fitzsimmons - Jefferies Group LLC - Analyst\nAnd then -- that's super helpful, Mark. And then if I could sneak in another. I know a couple of quarters back, (multiple speakers) that's from two --\nsorry, three to four years. Is that continuing to roughly track at four years now, one quarter into 2025? And then just help us think about kind of\nthe pace of on-prem decline conversions you're seeing in your business in 2025 relative to what you saw in late fiscal 2024?\nMadhu Ranganathan - Open Text Corp - President, CFO and Corporate Development\nAnd Billy, Madhu here. The very first part of your question didn't come through, if you don't mind repeating it.\nBilly Fitzsimmons - Jefferies Group LLC - Analyst\nYeah. The first part was just -- I know a couple of quarters ago, cloud contract duration stretched from three years to four years. Is that continuing\nto track at roughly four years?\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nYes. Fair enough. I got it. Thanks, Billy. Look, I'd note on SAP's earnings call, they talked about their average contract length going out to about 4.5\nyears. And we're we tow right along with SAP on our SAP business, which is an important part of our business. So they've talked about extending\nout to 4.5 years.\nWe're about 4 years right now. We -- I think we have a little better control over that ramping. We did note -- as you noted -- we noted a couple of\nquarters ago that we began to see this increasing ramp in agreements. So it has stabilized. And we're getting a little -- and we're also getting better\ncontrol of our partners, right?\nSo of saying, okay, this is sort of the high watermark. So it's not continuing to ramp. I would say that it's hit a high water mark. We're starting maybe\nto dial it back a little bit. But we're seeing just around 4 years. SAP was very -- had their disclosure around 4.5 years.\nAnd then on the on-prem to cloud, which I think was another part of your question, it's all about the second half drivers for us. When I look at\nTitanium X and one of the design principles of Titanium X, the first principle was to have the Titanium X is designed and built for staff. And that's\nwhy we're calling it out.\nSo that's where our major piece is core content, service management, digital operations, developer experience, and XDR as a service is only a SaaS\noffering. And so I think we'll continue to see in a very controlled way. Customers continue to move from on-premise, and we've done great to the\nprivate cloud, and Titanium X will give us now the next growth swim lane, which is to move on-prem into SaaS and continue to do this in a very\ncontrolled way.\nOperator\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\n10\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Thank you. Mark, since we are in this new AI world, like how do you think about adoption patterns between like your Aviator offerings, et\ncetera, and kind of the more kind of initial steps with the Microsoft Copilot, et cetera, like how do you think that will play out in terms of (inaudible)\nand then when you're talking to customers in terms of like adoption -- cycle adoption patterns?\nIs that like first, you kind of do the standard kind of Microsoft type Copilot stuff, then you come to you? Is it going straight to you because the value\nadd is so high. Can you speak to that of what you're seeing there in the market, please?\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nYeah. I mean, I'll speak first. Thanks, Raimo. I'll speak first to us, which is we are seeing steady progress. We've been -- this is our third, fourth quarter\nof having Aviators in the market by Titanium X. We're going to have 15 Aviators and 100-plus agents, and it is commonplace. So like having a search\nbutton on a screen right? We have an Aviator button on screens now, and over 100 agents permeated through all of Titanium X. And so it's easier\nto use. It's easier to deploy, and it's getting less expensive.\nStill a little expensive. When you look at the platform providers, you sort of buy by the drink, right? Or you make multiyear commitments. Interestingly\nfor us, we see customers working on big problem sets. And so there's -- so and we're like -- we're very close to like breakthrough moments on very\nbig problem sets.\nSo it's steady as we go. It's in every conversation. We're so delighted with Titanium X in the world we see it live here in a couple of weeks, where\nit's almost like a search button on every screen. We had 20 wins directly related to GenAI Aviators in the quarter. And we're just going to keep\nmaking steady progress.\nAnd it's all going to support our bookings aspirations up to 25% bookings growth, is going to support our cloud growth -- revenue growth of 2%\nto 5%. But I think it's just steady, steady, steady, and then there's a step-up at some outer point. But we're making really good progress on making\nit easy to use, deeply embedded, radically focused on driving down the cost and making it a button, an agent button on all our major processes.\nRaimo Lenschow - Barclays plc - Analyst\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you. And then one for Madhu, like if I look at the margin performance this quarter was very strong, guidance is really healthy\nhere. Is there anything that we should be aware of in terms of timing that some of the costs got pushed out in the second half? Or is this just all\nkind of you're doing your job and controlling what you can control? Thank you.\nMadhu Ranganathan - Open Text Corp - President, CFO and Corporate Development\nYeah. Thanks, Raimo. We are doing the job and beyond our job. And I'll explain that in the last couple of years since the close of Micro Focus\ntransaction, we have taken a lot of cost out, and we've been reporting that to you systematically, right? We also announced a business optimization\nplan in early July, the implementation of it was also very early to provide us the benefit throughout the year.\nWhat's really happening in the second half is very consistent for OpenText, our annual merit increases on January 1. And as I said, we are seeing --\nthat could employ your retention as well as sales capacity we mentioned. So that's really what you're seeing in the second half of the year. But\nhaving a great start on adjusted EBITDA in Q1 is what's really supporting us and the confidence to maintain the 33% to 34% for the year.\nRaimo Lenschow - Barclays plc - Analyst\nOkay. Perfect. Thank.\n11\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Mr. Treiber, your line is open.\nPerhaps we should move on.\nErin Kyle, CIBC.\nErin Kyle - CIBC Capital Markets - Analyst\nHi, good morning. It's Erin Kyle on for Stephanie Price. I wanted to ask a question just on the revenue growth, excluding AMC, which was negative\n1.8% this quarter. So assuming this is all organic now. How do you think about organic growth at Micro Focus post the AMC divestiture? And what\nare the key lines of business that you expect that will drive you towards achieving organic growth?\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nYes. Sounds great, Erin. Thanks for being on the call this morning. Let me start with that we're maintaining our outlook for the year, which is constant\nto 1% growth. And we -- we look at our business by market area today. So in particular, for what we acquired from Micro Focus, deconstruct that\ninto security, into digital operations and into the developer, if you will. We are deeply excited on the security side.\nAs noted, our XDR as a service is taking what we acquired from Micro Focus plus components from other parts of the business like forensics, like\nBricata on the network side, plus our e-mail security from Zix. And we're bringing it all together in a unified composable offering called XDR as a\nService, and we're quite excited about it. So we see security being a growth driver for us.\nSecond piece is what was historically called ITOM what we now call digital operations. And I'm just really excited about the product offering around\ndiscovery, which feeds into security, by the way. What are you securing [indiscernible] discover the assets.\nObservability into the infrastructure, observability across multi-cloud, financial ops management, sustainability and green computing, which has\nbeen our priority. So the product has just made incredible strides, if you will. We've got a little more work to do on the developer side. It's more of\na complex area.\nSo we stabilized historical Micro Focus last year, as we talked about. We are now in a platform where we're looking to grow Micro Focus, particularly\nin security and digital operations. We got a little more work to do on ADM, and we factor that all into our constant to 1% organic growth this year.\nErin Kyle - CIBC Capital Markets - Analyst\nOkay. Thank you. That's helpful. Quick color there. And maybe if I could just ask one more question just on capital allocation. So you did $85 million\nin buybacks this quarter. And I noticed targets are unchanged for the year. So I just wanted to clarify the strategy is still to focus primarily on that\norganic growth and return of capital to shareholders and whether M&A fits into the picture at all?\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nYeah. So a couple of things there. We're excited about delivering a record amount of capital this year to shareholders. So we are -- we've announced\nplans around approximately $570 million of return of capital will be the highest in the company's history. And delivering that amount by the end\nof this year, we will have delivered $3 billion over a decade, and we're on target to have the highest capital return in the history of the company\nthis year.\n12\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

And so with the stabilization of Micro Focus, the divestiture behind us, of Titanium X coming into the market. Yes, you\ncan expect us to continue to look at M&A, small- to medium-sized cloud companies, profitable, generating ARR for us, that fit into our current\nstrategic thesis.\nErin Kyle - CIBC Capital Markets - Analyst\nOkay. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nRichard Tse, National Bank Financial.\nMike Stevens - National Bank Financial - Analyst\nHi, good morning. This is Mike Stevens on for Rich. Just more broadly, you touched on M&A there. But are there any further opportunities to\nstreamline the company for growth, a la the AMC divestiture?\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nYeah. I mean our whole script and our whole narrative is on driving organic growth, right? So -- and having some M&A what was the question. So\nyes, I mean, it's all about the second half and what we've talked about. It's bringing Titanium X to market, which is across all our business clouds.\nIt's driving growth in our new AI offering, business AI and business technology in particular, security. And as we noted, we're at a high watermark\nfor sales capacity. Our pipeline is up 20% year-over-year for cloud and AI. And the main thrust of the company is all focused on organic growth.\nMike Stevens - National Bank Financial - Analyst\nOkay. That's helpful. Additionally, with the Aviator, you mentioned the number of wins in the quarter. How much approximately would that represent\nof bookings? And where do you see that kind of going forward?\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nYeah. No, we didn't break out of the 10% bookings growth. How much of that was related to Aviators, if you will. But clearly, it was in the large\ndeals and in the bookings growth that we had within Q1. So it's the main part of how we sell today, right?\nSo we go to market today and our strategy. Again, we start with our business clouds, from content all the way through the developer. We go to\nmarket around, supported right underneath there, a multi-cloud offering and then coupled with security and AI.\nSo it is now a coordinated part of how we go to market. And I expect steady, steady, steady progress every single quarter. Q1, 20 direct wins related\nto AI. We'll have direct wins in Q2. It will add to our targets of going from 10% up to our mid-20s, 25% cloud bookings growth for the year. So it is\ncontributing to the bookings growth for sure.\nMike Stevens - National Bank Financial - Analyst\nOkay. I appreciate the insights, and I'll pass the line.

The cloud revenue growth was subdued this quarter. And I understand you're looking for that to accelerate for all the reasons\ncited. But just in terms of the quarter in particular, -- is that a function of the delayed deal ramp dynamic that you called out? Is there any just in\nSMB? Or what are some contributing factors?\nMadhu Ranganathan - Open Text Corp - President, CFO and Corporate Development\nYeah, Thanos, it's Madhu here. I'll pick up the question and Mark can chime in, of course. So think of cloud revenue as it is recurring. But certainly,\nin our third and fourth quarters, we do see a lot more of the volume and sort of the variable side of the cloud revenue picking up. So we had over\n3% growth in Q4 of last year, and that's typical of our sort of end of fiscal year strength.\nAnd Q1, the growth is right where we expect it to be on revenue. As Mark outlined earlier, no further sort of expansion of where the cloud contracts\nare, they're still around the 4-year mark for what we do and slightly longer when we look at SAP. So nothing has changed there. And I would look\nat Q1 cloud revenue as more of Q1 light seasonality.\nThanos Moschopoulos - BMO Capital Markets - Analyst\nGreat. And then Mark, can you comment on SMB. So another business implies there if you go back a few months. How has that been looking? And\nyou alluded to a new platform you're launching for SMB, you can stand on that?\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nYes. Thanks, Thanos. And yes, I mean, as Madhu noted, we had our quarterly factors for Q1, and we delivered right to what we said we're going to\ndo on revenue. And that's inclusive of cloud seasonally lower quarter for us and inclusive of SMB, right, in all those numbers. Now we're excited.\nIt's a different year for us in SMB than it was last year. And we now have our partner platform live in the market, what we call secure cloud. So we've\ngone from project El Dorado to the actual service offering called Secure Cloud or live.\nAnd the platform allows us -- allows partners to be able to buy from us, allows partners now we can easily add new products like our Pillr acquisition,\nwhich is on Secure Cloud, and allows partners to then go sell to their customers and then to be able to monitor their installed base and usage. So\nit's sort of a PRM, is a partner relationship management platform that allows us to sell, partners to sell and partners to manage. And it's now all\nbuilt by OpenText, flexible, customizable and we're just delighted with it. So that's an enabler for us.\nSecond is we've gotten closer with our biggest partner in this area, Microsoft. And Microsoft is one of their biggest investment areas for the year.\nAnd then thirdly, the demand is starting to pick back up. So we think those three factors, we have gone from a headwind, if you will, to just steady\nas you go. And I think we'll pick up some tailwinds throughout the year.\nSo we're quite excited about it.\n14\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

I'll pass the line. Thanks.\nOperator\nAdhir Kadve, Eight Capital.\nKiran Sritharan - Eight Capital - Analyst\nGood morning, all. This is (Kiran Sritharan) on for Adhir. My first, I just want to touch on the cloud growth range again between 2% to 5%, following\nthis quarter, what factors you'd call out that contribute to the bottom and the top end of that range?\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nI would say three factors. First is SaaS. Customers adopting our SaaS capabilities in Titanium X; two, seeing Aviator and our AI contribute revenue.\nAnd then some product-specific pieces, in particular, I'd call out security, XDR as a Service. Those are three things that are going to drive us to the\ntop end of the range.\nKiran Sritharan - Eight Capital - Analyst\nThanks, Mark. And then on -- I'd like to zoom in on the investment in the sales and go-to-market. Where are you in the hiring cycle of these days?\nAnd maybe you can also comment on the experience levels and the pace at which this cohort would contribute just given the refresh your\ngo-to-market strategy? Thanks and I'll leave it there.\nMark Barrenechea - Open Text Corp - CEO, CTO and Vice Chair\nYes. Thanks for the question. Yes, as noted, we're having great success in going to market, attracting and in hiring very qualified account executives\nand solution consultants. And we are at sort of our capacity, if you will, -- and that's driven by a few things. So first of all, the schedule, we attract\nskilled professionals.\nWe don't tend to look for kind of the fresh grad to come into enterprise selling. We do hire those straight out of college, maybe into inside sales\nand then to grow in the organization or account development executive. So it's a great place to enter OpenText and then to grow, But what I was\ntalking about was the qualified sales executives that have been in the market 7 to 15 years joining OpenText.\nSo we're just having great success in doing that. We're at capacity. We're also -- our employee engagement is incredibly strong with our highest\nretention rates for employees. So our employee value proposition is very strong. strong for the new hire kind of entering OpenText as inside sales\nor account development and then to grow your career, get your first job out [of school] and grow with us.\nAnd then the skilled professional 7 to 15 years out of enterprise software companies that has brought us to the top of our capacity. And it will help\nthem both with AI, both cohorts with AI and Ollie.ai.\nMadhu Ranganathan - Open Text Corp - President, CFO and Corporate Development\nAnd if I could just add here, when Mark mentioned we're at capacity in Q1, early part of the year, I mean, that was a very important conscious step\nwe undertook in order to have a strong second half, given all the product innovation that are coming through. And then when I spoke about the\n15\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.
