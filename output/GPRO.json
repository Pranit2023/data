[GoPro.com](http://GoPro.com) revenue, including subscription and service revenue, was $51 million, or 20% of total revenue and down 19% year-over-year.\n  * GAAP net loss was $8 million, or a $(0.05) loss per share, compared to a net loss of $4 million or $(0.02) loss per share, in the prior year period.\n  * Non-GAAP net loss was $0.5 million, or breakeven on a per share basis, compared to non-GAAP net income of $9 million, or $0.06 per share, in the prior year period.\n  * GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin was 35.5% and 35.6%, respectively. This compares to GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 32.0% and 32.2%, respectively, in the prior year period.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $5 million, a $39 million sequential improvement, and compared to $7 million in the prior year period.\n  * Cameras with Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Prices (MSRP) at or above $400 represented 74% of Q3 2024 camera revenue. Q3 2024 Street ASP was $294, an 8% decrease year-over-year.\n  * Cash and marketable securities were down slightly sequentially at $130 million.\n\n\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * In September, we launched two new products, our flagship HERO13 Black and our entry-level camera, the tiny form factor 4K HERO, priced at $199.\n  * We updated our restructuring plan for Q4 2024 to significantly reduce operating expenses and position GoPro for profitability in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Results Summary:**\n\n**Three months ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**($ in thousands, except per share amounts)** | **2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \n**Revenue** | $ 258,898 | $ 294,299 | (12.0) %  \n**Gross margin**  \nGAAP | 35.5 % | 32.0 % | 350 bps  \nNon-GAAP | 35.6 % | 32.2 % | 340 bps  \n**Operating income (loss)**  \nGAAP | $ (8,011) | $ (3,787) | 111.5 %  \nNon-GAAP | $ 950 | $ 5,745 | (83.5) %  \n**Net income (loss)**  \nGAAP | $ (8,211) | $ (3,684) | 122.9 %  \nNon-GAAP (1) | $ (463) | $ 8,996 | (105.1) %  \n**Diluted net income (loss) per share**  \nGAAP | $ (0.05) | $ (0.02) | 150.0 %  \nNon-GAAP (1) | $ (0.00) | $ 0.06 | (100.0) %  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | $ 5,447 | $ 7,232 | (24.7) %  \n  \n(1)  | In the first quarter of 2024, we revised the income tax adjustment to reflect current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) and the effect of non-GAAP adjustments to better align with SEC guidance.

Additionally, GoPro reports non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP items exclude, where applicable, the effects of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, restructuring and other related costs, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on the sale and license of intellectual property, and the tax impact of these items. When planning, forecasting, and analyzing gross margin, operating expenses, operating income (loss), other income (expense), tax expense (benefit), net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share for future periods, GoPro does so primarily on a non-GAAP basis without preparing a GAAP analysis as that would require estimates for reconciling items which are inherently difficult to predict with reasonable accuracy. A reconciliation of preliminary GAAP to non-GAAP measures has been provided in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation. \n\n**Note on Forward-looking Statements**\n\nThis press release may contain projections or other forward-looking statements within the meaning Section 27A of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"plan\" and variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this press release may include but are not limited to statements regarding our expectations for profitability, operating expenses, revenue growth and subscription growth; expanded product roadmap, expanded retail presence, distribution and overall consumer demand for our products. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual events or results may differ materially. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the inability to achieve our revenue growth or profitability in the future, and if revenue growth or profitability is achieved, the inability to sustain it; the fact that an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key U.S. and international markets, inflation, and fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products; the fact that our goal to grow revenue and be profitable relies upon our ability to manage expenses and grow sales from our direct-to-consumer business, our retail partners, and distributors; our ability to acquire and retain subscribers; our reliance on third-party suppliers, some of which are sole-source suppliers, to provide services and components for our products which may be impacted due to supply shortages, long lead times or other service disruptions that may lead to increased costs due to the effects of global conflicts and geopolitical issues such as the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, Ukraine or China-Taiwan relations; our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights; the risk that our sales fall below our forecasts, especially during the holiday season; the risk we fail to manage our operating expenses effectively, which may result in our financial performance suffering; the fact that our profitability depends in part on further penetrating our total addressable market, and we may not be successful in doing so; the risk we are able to reduce our operating expenses and achieve profitability in 2025; the fact that we rely on sales of our cameras, mounts and accessories for substantially all of our revenue, and any decrease in the sales or change in sales mix of these products could harm our business; the risk that we may not successfully manage product introductions, product transitions, product pricing and marketing; our ability to achieve or maintain profitability if there are delays or issues in our product launches; the fact that a small number of retailers and distributors account for a substantial portion of our revenue and our level of business with them could be significantly reduced; our ability to attract, engage and retain qualified personnel; any changes to trade agreements, trade policies, tariffs, and import/export regulations; the impact of competition on our market share, revenue and profitability; the fact that we may experience fluctuating revenue, expenses and profitability in the future; risks related to inventory, purchase commitments and long-lived assets; the risk that we will encounter problems with our distribution system; the threat of a security breach or other disruption including cyberattacks; the concern that our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and services; and other factors detailed in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and as updated in filings with the SEC including the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

to Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our unaudited selected financial data presented on a basis consistent with GAAP, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin percentage, operating expenses, operating income (loss), other income (expense), tax expense (benefit), net income (loss), diluted net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA. We also provide forecasts of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP tax expense (benefit), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share. We use non-GAAP financial measures to help us understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operational plans. Our management uses and believes that investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, the measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by facilitating:\n\n  * the comparability of our on-going operating results over the periods presented;\n  * the ability to identify trends in our underlying business; and\n  * the comparison of our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of other public companies that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense (benefit), which may change cash available to us;\n  * adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest income (expense), which may reduce cash available to us;\n  * adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization and, although these are non-cash charges, the property and equipment being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements;\n  * adjusted EBITDA excludes the amortization of point of purchase (POP) display assets because it is a non-cash charge, and is treated similarly to depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of acquired intangible assets;\n  * adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) exclude restructuring and other related costs which primarily include severance-related costs, stock-based compensation expenses, manufacturing consolidation charges, facilities consolidation charges recorded in connection with restructuring actions, including right-of-use asset impairment charges (if applicable), and the related ongoing operating lease cost of those facilities recorded under ASC 842, _Leases_. These expenses do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of current operating performance or comparisons to the operating performance in other periods;\n  * adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) exclude stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards granted primarily to our workforce. We exclude stock-based compensation expense because we believe that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In particular, we note that companies calculate stock-based compensation expense for the variety of award types that they employ using different valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions. These non-cash charges are not factored into our internal evaluation of non-GAAP net income (loss) as we believe their inclusion would hinder our ability to assess core operational performance;\n  * adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) excludes any gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt because it is not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period, and the frequency and amount of such gains and losses vary;\n  * non-GAAP net income (loss) excludes acquisition-related costs including the amortization of acquired intangible assets (primarily consisting of acquired technology), the impairment of acquired intangible assets (if applicable), as well as third-party transaction costs incurred for legal and other professional services. These costs are not factored into our evaluation of potential acquisitions, or of our performance after completion of the acquisitions because these costs are not related to our core operating performance or reflective of ongoing operating results in the period, and the frequency and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the timing and magnitude of our acquisition transactions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Although we exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP net income (loss), management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and can contribute to revenue generation;\n  * non-GAAP net income (loss) excludes a gain on the sale and/or license of intellectual property. This gain is not related to our core operating performance or reflective of ongoing operating results in the period, and the frequency and amount of such gains are inconsistent;\n  * non-GAAP net income (loss) includes income tax adjustments. In the first quarter of 2024, we revised our income tax adjustments to reflect the current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) and the effect of non-GAAP adjustments to better align with SEC guidance. For comparative purposes, we have revised the prior year income tax adjustments to reflect current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) and the effect of non-GAAP adjustments. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2024, we revised the first quarter of 2024 income tax adjustment to exclude the establishment of a valuation allowance on the United States federal and state deferred tax assets;\n  * GAAP and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share includes the dilutive, tax effected cash interest expense associated with our 2025 Notes in periods of net income, as if converted at the beginning of the period; and\n  * other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n\n\n**GoPro, Inc.** **Reconciliation of Preliminary GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures** **(unaudited)**  \n---  \nReconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are set forth below:  \n**Three months ended September 30,** | **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n**(in thousands, except per share data)** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**GAAP net loss** | $ (8,211) | $ (3,684) | $ (395,120) | $ (50,765)  \nStock-based compensation:  \nCost of revenue | 349 | 500 | 1,103 | 1,496  \nResearch and development | 3,669 | 4,713 | 11,950 | 14,381  \nSales and marketing | 1,603 | 2,125 | 4,892 | 6,662  \nGeneral and administrative | 1,751 | 2,679 | 5,988 | 8,909  \nTotal stock-based compensation | 7,372 | 10,017 | 23,933 | 31,448  \nAcquisition-related costs:  \nResearch and development | 469 | — | 1,094 | —  \nGeneral and administrative | 15 | — | 796 | —  \nTotal acquisition-related costs | 484 | — | 1,890 | —  \nRestructuring and other costs:  \nCost of revenue | — | (23) | 137 | (248)  \nResearch and development | 679 | (262) | 2,941 | (677)  \nSales and marketing | 314 | (132) | 1,612 | (356)  \nGeneral and administrative | 112 | (68) | 1,061 | (180)  \nTotal restructuring and other costs | 1,105 | (485) | 5,751 | (1,461)  \nGain on sale and/or license of intellectual property | (999) | — | (999) | —  \nIncome tax adjustments (1) | (214) | 3,148 | 8,546 | (3,639)  \n**Non-GAAP net income (loss)** | $ (463) | $ 8,996 | $ (355,999) | $ (24,417)  \nNon-GAAP net income (loss) - basic  | $ (463) | $ 8,996 | $ (355,999) | $ (24,417)  \nAdd: Interest on convertible notes, tax effected | — | 461 | — | —  \nNon-GAAP net income (loss) - diluted | $ (463) | $ 9,457 | $ (355,999) | $ (24,417)  \n**GAAP shares for diluted net loss per share** | 153,741 | 152,409 | 152,449 | 154,113  \nAdd: Effect of non-GAAP dilutive securities | — | 16,272 | — | —  \n**Non-GAAP shares for diluted net income (loss) per share** | 153,741 | 168,681 | 152,449 | 154,113  \n**GAAP diluted net loss per share** | $ (0.05) | $ (0.02) | $ (2.59) | $ (0.33)  \n**Non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share** | $ (0.00) | $ 0.06 | $ (2.34) | $ (0.16)  \n  \n(1)  | In the first quarter of 2024, we revised the income tax adjustment to reflect current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) and the effect of non-GAAP adjustments to better align with SEC guidance.

Among the\nimportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the inability to achieve our revenue\ngrowth or profitability in the future, and if revenue growth or profitability is achieved, the inability to sustain it; the fact that an economic downturn or economic\nuncertainty in our key U.S. and international markets, inflation, and fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates may adversely affect consumer\ndiscretionary spending and demand for our products; the fact that our goal to grow revenue and be profitable relies upon our ability to grow sales from our direct-\nto-consumer business and our retail partners and distributors; our ability to acquire and retain subscribers; our reliance on third-party suppliers, some of which\nare sole-source suppliers, to provide services and components for our products which may be impacted due to supply shortages, long lead times or other\nservice disruptions that may lead to increased costs due to the effects of global conflicts and geopolitical issues such as the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East,\nUkraine or China-Taiwan relations; our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights; the\nrisk that our sales fall below our forecasts, especially during the holiday season; the risk we fail to manage our operating expenses effectively, which may result\nin our financial performance suffering the fact that our continued profitability depends in part on further penetrating our total addressable market, and we may not\nbe successful in doing so; the risk we are able to reduce our operating expenses and achieve profitability in 2025; the fact that we rely on sales of our cameras,\nmounts and accessories for substantially all of our revenue, and any decrease in the sales or change in sales mix of these products could harm our business;\nthe risk that we may not successfully manage product introductions, product transitions, product pricing and marketing; our ability to maintain profitability if there\nare delays or issues in our product launches; the fact that a small number of retailers and distributors account for a substantial portion of our revenue and our\nlevel of business with them could be significantly reduced; our ability to attract, engage and retain qualified personnel; any changes to trade agreements, trade\npolicies, tariffs, and import/export regulations; the impact of competition on our market share, revenue and profitability; the fact that we may experience\nfluctuating revenue, expenses and profitability in the future; risks related to inventory, purchase commitments and long-lived assets; the risk that we will\nencounter problems with our distribution system; the threat of a security breach or other disruption including cyberattacks; the concern that our intellectual\nproperty and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and services; the effects of global conflicts and geopolitical issues such as the conflicts\nin the Middle East, Ukraine or China-Taiwan relations and its effects on the United States and global economies and our business in particular; and other factors\ndetailed in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2023, which is on file with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC), and as updated in filings with the SEC including the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September30, 2024.\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the date otherwise stated herein.

GGooPPrroo,, IInncc.. AAllll rriigghhttss rreesseerrvveedd..\nAppendix: GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations\nTo supplement our unaudited selected financial data presented on a basis consistent with GAAP, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, including non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin percentage, operating expenses, operating income (loss), net income (loss), diluted\nnet income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA. We use non-GAAP financial measures to help us understand and evaluate our core operating\nperformance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operational plans. Our\nmanagement uses and believes that investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, the measures prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP, and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when\nread in conjunction with our GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by facilitating:\n● the comparability of our on-going operating results over the periods presented;\n● the ability to identify trends in our underlying business; and\n● the comparison of our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of other public companies thatsupplement\ntheir GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results ofoperations as\ndetermined in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n● adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense (benefit), which may change cash available to us;\n● adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest income (expense), which may reduce cash available to us;\n● adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization and, although these are non-cash charges, the property and equipment being\ndepreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash capitalexpenditure\nrequirements for such replacements;\nCopyright © 2024. GoPro, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAppendix: GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations\n● adjusted EBITDA excludes the amortization of point of purchase (POP) display assets because it is a non-cash charge, and is treated similarly to\ndepreciation of property and equipment and amortization of acquired intangible assets;\n● adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) exclude restructuring and other related costs which primarily include severance-related costs,\nstock-based compensation expenses, manufacturing consolidation charges, facilities consolidation charges recorded in connection with\nrestructuring actions, including right-of-use asset impairment charges (if applicable), and the related ongoing operating lease cost of those\nfacilities recorded under ASC 842, Leases. These expenses do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a\nmeaningful evaluation of current operating performance or comparisons to the operating performance in other periods;\n● adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) exclude stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards granted primarily to our\nworkforce. We exclude stock-based compensation expense because we believe that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item\nprovide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In particular, we note that companies calculate stock-based\ncompensation expense for the variety of award types that they employ using different valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions. These\nnon-cash charges are not factored into our internal evaluation of non-GAAP net income (loss) as we believe their inclusion would hinder our ability\nto assess core operational performance;\n● adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) excludes any gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt because it is not reflective of ongoing\noperating results in the period, and the frequency and amount of such gains and losses vary;\n● non-GAAP net income (loss) excludes acquisition-related costs including the amortization of acquired intangible assets (primarily consisting of\nacquired technology), the impairment of acquired intangible assets (if applicable), as well as third-party transaction costs incurred for legal and\nother professional services. These costs are not factored into our evaluation of potential acquisitions, or of our performance after completion of the\nacquisitions because these costs are not related to our core operating performance or reflective of ongoing operating resultsinthe period, and the\nfrequency and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the timing and magnitude of our acquisition transactions and the maturities of the\nbusinesses being acquired. Although we exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP net income (loss),\nmanagement believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting\nand can contribute to revenue generation;\n● non-GAAP net income (loss) excludes a gain on the sale and/or license of intellectual property. This gain is not related to ourcore operating\nperformance or reflective of ongoing operating results in the period, and the frequency and amount of such gains are inconsistent;\nCopyright © 2024. GoPro, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAppendix: GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations\n● non-GAAP net income (loss) includes income tax adjustments. In the first quarter of 2024, we revised our income tax adjustmentsto reflect the\ncurrent and deferred income tax expense (benefit) and the effect of non-GAAP adjustments to better align with SEC guidance. For comparative\npurposes, we have revised the prior year income tax adjustments to reflect current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) andthe effect of\nnon-GAAP adjustments. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2024, we revised the first quarter of 2024 income tax adjustment toexclude the\nestablishment of a valuation allowance on the United States federal and state deferred tax assets;\n● GAAP and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share includes the dilutive, tax effected cash interest expense associated with our 2022 Notes and\n2025 Notes in periods of net income, as if converted at the beginning of the period in connection with the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1,\n2022; and\n● other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nCopyright © 2024.
