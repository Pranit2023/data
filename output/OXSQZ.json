To the extent the Company’s taxable earnings fall below the total amount of the Company’s distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a tax return of capital to the Company’s stockholders. The ultimate tax character of the Company’s earnings cannot be determined until tax returns are prepared after the end of the fiscal year. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates (based on an average of the reported tax character historically) and are not being provided for U.S. tax reporting purposes.  \n(4)| Total return based on market value equals the increase or decrease of ending market value over beginning market value, plus distributions, divided by the beginning market value, assuming distribution reinvestment prices obtained under the Company’s distribution reinvestment plan, excluding any discounts. Total return is not annualized.  \n(5)| Total return based on net asset value equals the increase or decrease of ending net asset value over beginning net asset value, plus distributions, divided by the beginning net asset value. Total return is not annualized.  \n(6)| Annualized and includes excise tax.  \n(7)| Portfolio turnover rate is calculated using the lesser of the year-to-date investment sales and debt repayments or year-to-date investment purchases over the average of the total investments at fair value.  \n(8)| The following table provides supplemental performance ratios (annualized) measured for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:  \n  \n**Three Months****Ended****March 31,****2024**| **Three Months****Ended****March 31,****2023**  \n---|---  \n**Ratio of expenses to average net assets:**  \nOperating expenses, including excise tax, before incentive fees| 11.17| %| 15.00| %  \nNet investment income incentive fees| —| %| 3.53| %  \nRatio of expenses, including excise tax and excluding interest expense, to average net assets| 5.88| %| 9.67| %  \n  \n**About Oxford Square Capital Corp.**\n\nOxford Square Capital Corp. is a publicly-traded business development company principally investing in syndicated bank loans and, to a lesser extent, debt and equity tranches of collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) vehicles.

include rounding adjustments to reconcile change in net asset value per share.(3) Management monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a tax return of capital may occur for the year. To the extent the Company’s taxable earnings fall below the total amount of the Company’s distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a tax return of capital to the Company’s stockholders. The ultimate tax character of the Company’s earnings cannot be determined until tax returns are prepared after the end of the fiscal year. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates (based on an average of the reported tax character historically) and are not being provided for U.S. tax reporting purposes.(4) Total return based on market value equals the increase or decrease of ending market value over beginning market value, plus distributions, divided by the beginning market value, assuming distribution reinvestment prices obtained under the Company’s distribution reinvestment plan, excluding any discounts. Total return is not annualized.(5) Total return based on net asset value equals the increase or decrease of ending net asset value over beginning net asset value, plus distributions, divided by the beginning net asset value. Total return is not annualized.(6) Annualized.(7) Portfolio turnover rate is calculated using the lesser of the year-to-date investment sales and debt repayments or year-to-date investment purchases over the average of the total investments at fair value.(8) The following table provides supplemental performance ratios (annualized) measured for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n**Three Months****Ended****September 30,****2024**| **Three Months****Ended****September 30,****2023**| **Nine Months****Ended****September 30,****2024**| **Nine Months****Ended****September 30,****2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Ratio of expenses to average net assets:**  \nOperating expenses before incentive fees| 10.71| %| 12.47| %| 10.75| %| 14.38| %  \nNet investment income incentive fees| —| %| 2.93| %| —| %| 3.34| %  \nRatio of expenses, excluding interest expense, to average net assets| 5.63| %| 9.09| %| 5.52| %| 9.89| %  \n  \n**About Oxford Square Capital Corp.**\n\nOxford Square Capital Corp. is a publicly-traded business development company principally investing in syndicated bank loans and, to a lesser extent, debt and equity tranches of collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) vehicles.

gains/(losses) include rounding adjustments to reconcile change in net asset value per share.(3) Management monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a tax return of capital may occur for the year. To the extent the Company’s taxable earnings fall below the total amount of the Company’s distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a tax return of capital to the Company’s stockholders. The ultimate tax character of the Company’s earnings cannot be determined until tax returns are prepared after the end of the fiscal year. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates (based on an average of the reported tax character historically) and are not being provided for U.S. tax reporting purposes.(4) Total return based on market value equals the increase or decrease of ending market value over beginning market value, plus distributions, divided by the beginning market value, assuming distribution reinvestment prices obtained under the Company’s distribution reinvestment plan, excluding any discounts. Total return is not annualized.(5) Total return based on net asset value equals the increase or decrease of ending net asset value over beginning net asset value, plus distributions, divided by the beginning net asset value. Total return is not annualized.(6) Annualized.(7) Portfolio turnover rate is calculated using the lesser of the year-to-date investment sales and debt repayments or year-to-date investment purchases over the average of the total investments at fair value.(8) The following table provides supplemental performance ratios (annualized) measured for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n**Three Months****Ended****June 30,****2024**| **Three Months****Ended****June 30,****2023**| **Six Months****Ended****June 30,****2024**| **Six Months****Ended****June 30,****2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Ratio of expenses to average net assets:**  \nOperating expenses before incentive fees| 11.15| %| 15.36| %| 10.99| %| 15.18| %  \nNet investment income incentive fees| —| %| 3.60| %| —| %| 3.57| %  \nRatio of expenses, excluding interest expense, to average net assets| 5.81| %| 10.41| %| 5.68| %| 10.05| %  \n  \n**About Oxford Square Capital Corp.**\n\nOxford Square Capital Corp. is a publicly-traded business development company principally investing in syndicated bank loans and, to a lesser extent, debt and equity tranches of collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) vehicles.
