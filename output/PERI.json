          "content": "Investor\nPresentation\nQ3 2024\nNovember 2024\n1\nForward Looking Statements\nThis presentation contains historical information and forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the business, financial condition and\nresults of operations of Perion. The words “will,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “should,” “estimate” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the\ncurrent views, assumptions and expectations of Perion with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Perion\nto be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, or financial information, including, but not limited to, the\ncurrent war between Israel and Hamas and any worsening of the situation in Israel (such as further mobilizations), the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of companies and businesses we acquired and may\nacquire in the future, risks entailed in integrating the companies and businesses we acquire, including employee retention and customer acceptance; the risk that such transactions will divert management and\nother resources from the ongoing operations of the business or otherwise disrupt the conduct of those businesses, potential litigation associated with such transactions, and general risks associated with the\nbusiness of Perion including intense and frequent changes in the markets in which the businesses operate and in general economic and business conditions, loss of key customers, data breaches, cyber-attacks\nand other similar incidents, unpredictable sales cycles, competitive pressures, market acceptance of new products, changes in applicable laws and regulations as well as industry self-regulation, inability to meet\nefficiency and cost reduction objectives, changes in business strategy and various other factors, whether referenced or not referenced in this presentation. Various other risks and uncertainties may affect Perion\nand its results of operations, as described in reports filed by Perion with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including its annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31,\n2023 filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024. Perion does not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Investors should read this presentation together with our respective quarterly press\nrelease furnished to the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures consist of GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain items. This presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures, including Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA,\nnon-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and Adjusted free cash flow.\nContribution ex-TAC presents revenue reduced by traffic acquisition costs and media buy, reflecting a portion of our revenue that must be directly passed to publishers or advertisers and presents our revenue\nexcluding such items. We believe Contribution ex-TAC is a useful measure in assessing the performance of the Company because it facilitates a consistent comparison against our core business without\nconsidering the impact of traffic acquisition costs and media buy related to revenue reported on a gross basis.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is defined as income from operations excluding stock-based compensation expenses, depreciation, amortization\nof acquired intangible assets, retention and other acquisition-related expenses, restructuring costs and gains and losses recognized with respect to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.\nAdjusted free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (or used in) operating activities less cash used for the purchase of property and equipment, but excluding the purchase of property and equipment\nrelated to our new corporate headquarter office and the portion of the cash payment of contingent consideration in excess of the acquisition date fair value, as we do not view either of those expenses as\nreflective of our normal on-going expenses. It is important to note that these expenses are in fact cash expenditures.\nNon-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are defined as net income and net earnings per share excluding stock-based compensation expenses, retention and other acquisition-related\nexpenses, restructuring costs, revaluation of acquisition-related contingent consideration, amortization of acquired intangible assets and the related taxes thereon, non-recurring expenses, foreign exchange\ngains and losses associated with ASC-842, as well as gains and losses recognized with respect to changes in fair value of contingent consideration.\nThe purpose of such adjustments is to give an indication of our performance exclusive of non-cash charges and other items that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results.\nThese non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Furthermore, the non-GAAP measures are regularly used internally to understand,\nmanage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions, and we believe that they are useful to investors as a consistent and comparable measure of the ongoing performance of our business.\nHowever, our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated\nfinancial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ materially from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Due to the\nhigh variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from these projected measures, together with some of the excluded information not being\nascertainable or accessible, we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required for such presentation without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no reconciliation of the forward-looking\nnon-GAAP financial measures is included in this presentation. A reconciliation between results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in the appendix to this presentation\n2\nTal Jacobson Elad Tzubery\nCEO CFO\n3\nWhat Perion builds technologies that make\ndigital advertising more effective by\nwe do\nconnecting the dots between data, creative\nand channels\nMost of our clients are Agencies, Brands\nand Retailers\n4\nOver a Decade of Delivering\nPositive Annual\nAdjusted EBITDA\n& Operating Cash Flow\n5\nPerion is a proven global technology leader\nPowering Advertising Across the Path to Purchase\n34+ markets\nAcross Perion\nHigh Impact\nDisplay Video Retail Media\nPERI Audio Social CTV DOOH\nPublicly traded on\nNASDAQ & TASE Advanced Technology\nDynamic Creative Device SORT, AI-powered\nOptimization Graph audience\nsegmentation\n435,000+\nSites & screens Industry Certifications\n6\n1\nThe ~$700b\nadvertising YouTube\nGoogle\nOutdoor\nMeta\nchallenge ads\nBing\nSpotify\nCMOs are navigating a\nOpen Pinterest\nfragmented universe of\nWeb Advertiser\nscreens, creative formats,\nand placements trying to\nconnect the dots and drive\nTikTok\nbusiness results.

          "content": "Perion Q3 Earnings Call | November 6, 2024\nModerator:\nHello everybody and welcome to the Perion Network third quarter 2024 earnings conference call.\nToday's conference is being recorded and an archive of the webcast will be posted on the company's\nwebsite. The press release detailing the financial results is available on the company's website at\nwww.perion.com. Before we begin, I'd like to read the following safe harbor statement. Today\ndiscussion includes forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the company's current views\nwith respect to future events. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and other factors, including those under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in the\ncompany's annual report on form 20F that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to\nbe materially different and any future results, performance, or achievements anticipated or implied by\nthe forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking\nstatements to reflect future events or circumstances.\nAs in prior quarters, the results reported today will be analyzed both on a gap and a non-gap basis.\nWhile mentioning EBITDA, we will be referring to Adjusted EBITDA. We have provided a detailed\nreconciliation of non-gap measures to their comparable gap measures in our earnings release, which is\navailable on our website and has also been filed on form 6K. Hosting the call today are Tal Jacobson,\nPerion's Chief Executive Officer, and Elad Tzubery, Perion's Chief Financial Officer. I would now like to\nturn the call over to Tal Jacobson. Please go ahead.\nTal Jacobson:\nGood morning, good afternoon, and welcome to Perion's third quarter 2024 earnings call. Today, I'm\npleased to share our results and highlight the progress we're making in digital advertising innovations.\nTechnology and profitability are two core essential elements of Perion’s culture. For over a decade,\nwe've been successfully building advanced, cutting-edge technologies at the forefront of Ed-tech\nindustry, and since 2014, Perion has been delivering positive annual Adjusted EBITDA and operating cash\nflow - an accomplishment we're proud of and committed to continue to drive.\nAt Perion, we aim to help CMOs, the same people who control almost $700 billion of digital advertising\nbudgets. This number is projected to reach almost a trillion dollars within three years.\nToday, CMOs face an almost impossible mission. They're required to provide continuous ROI on\nadvertising budgets. They're expected to do this while working in a fragmented ecosystem of channels,\ndata points, screen sizes, audience segmentation, and many different media buying platforms. All this\nwhile respecting the privacy of the consumer and ensuring a minimal budget waste.\nIn all our conversation with brands and agencies, we hear the same thing. They're all looking for a\nholistic solution that can run across the omnichannel universe and provide the best results while\nreducing waste.\nThis landscape demands advanced, efficient data-driven solution. That's exactly where Perion stands out\nwith its AI-driven technologies.\nPerion is taking a unique approach to what people used to call the linear consumer journey. We\nunderstand that human behavior has changed so much in the past few years, and each person interacts\ndifferently with technology throughout the day. Perion's technology is deeply rooted in each channel to\nensure we can deliver marketing messages at the right time to the right consumer. We connect the dots.\nPage 1 of 9\nWe do this across the digital advertising space between data, creative, and media, to ensure that brands\nachieve better returns and meaningful outcomes.\nOur advanced technologies keep us ahead of the curve, anticipating shifts in digital advertising. As CTV,\nretail media, digital out-of-home and audio ads lead today's industry trends, we continuously\nintroducing new innovative technological solutions. Our solutions position Perion at the forefront of\nthose high growth areas.\nLess than a year ago, we launched our advanced generative AI solution for audio ads, forecasting the\nmovements in the digital advertising industry. Indeed, we're now seeing the largest industry players\ninvesting in audio with a new deal between The Trade Desk and Spotify coming to life. As Jeff Green\ncommented: “digital audio might be the most on-sale corner of the internet. The time spent to ad spend\nratio has the highest disparity of any channel”.\nWe will continue to look at the changes and build advanced technologies for it to capture the revenues\nand stay ahead of the curve. Our advanced technologies are built to solve the advertisers’ toughest\nchallenges, leveraging AI to optimize campaigns for better efficiencies and reach.\nIn our AI lab, we continue to produce amazing products. You're all familiar with SORT and WAVE. SORT is\nour advanced AI audience segmentation technology for CTV and web, designed perfectly for cookie-less\nenvironments. And WAVE is our advanced generative AI audio ad solution.\nPerion's Creative Studio is our AI driven DCO, Dynamic Creative Optimization, that builds and delivers\nthe most effective creative in real-time across multiple channels. And, our recently launched product, a\nunique advertising experience powered by Chat AI capabilities, connects brands with their consumers\nthrough AI conversations and boosts engagements by enabling in-ad interactions tailored to each\nperson.\nEverything we do is focused on one thing - providing great results for our brands. Great results come\nwhen combining advanced technology and premium inventory. This is why when it comes to inventory,\nPerion works with the best.\nIn the past year, we've made many advancements connecting our technology to the leading platforms\nwithin our ecosystem. This is our way to ensure that our clients get the best of all worlds when working\nwith us. Having advanced technology with a high level of flexibility that meets our client needs is our\nfirst priority.\nIt is our unparalleled capabilities that make Perion a trusted partner. We work with some of the\nindustry's most recognized brands and agencies, setting new standards and creating impactful results.\nI'm pleased to report that our growth engines continue to perform strongly. Digital out-of-home, retail\nmedia, and CTV delivered strong growth of 63%, 62%, and 19% year over year, respectively.\nAs we look into the future, I invite you to be part of what's next for Perion. Here's what set us apart as\nan investment opportunity: Innovation is in our DNA. We're constantly pushing boundaries, staying\nahead of the industry trend. We have a decade-long track record of generating positive adjusted EBITDA\nand operating cash flow. Our commitment to high growth areas such as digital out-of-home, retail\nmedia and CTV, positions us at the forefront of the market. Our leadership team brings deep industry\nexpertise and visionary approach to every decision. And with our global footprint, we can serve clients\nand partners in high-growth markets, positioning us for accelerated growth.\nNow I'll turn it over to our CFO, Elad Tzubery who will discuss our quarterly financial results.\nPage 2 of 9\nElad Tzubery:\nThank you, Tal. Good afternoon and good morning to those of you joining us from the US.\nAfter completing my first quarter as Perion’s Chief Financial Officer, I'm glad to share that our third\nquarter results were in line with our expectations.\nIn the third quarter, we continued to experience strong contribution from our growth engines - Retail\nMedia, CTV, and Digital out-of-home.\nAs we previously disclosed, we continue to see a decline during the quarter in our Search business, in\nopen web video, and in standard display formats.\nWithin search, we experienced the full impact of the actions taken by Microsoft Bing earlier this year,\nand are now generating what we believe is a normalized revenue run rate for the fourth quarter of\n2024.\nIn the third quarter, we were profitable, we repurchased additional shares and continue to maintain a\nstrong net cash position. Our favorable financial position will allow us to continue investing in\ntechnology, organic growth and executing our M&A strategy.\nFor the third quarter that ended on September 30th, 2024, revenue was $102.2 million, a 45% year-\nover-year decrease. This was primarily due to a 76% decrease in Search revenue and the continuous\nweakness in our open web video standard ad formats.\nThese results were partially offset by an increase in revenue, attributable to our growth engines.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $7.4 million, representing a 83% year-over-year decrease, and resulting in a 7%\nadjusted EBITDA margin and 16% ex-TAC margin.\nGAAP net income was $2.1 million while non-GAAP net income was $11.9 million. As of September 30th,\n2024, net cash including cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and marketable securities was $383.9\nmillion. During the third quarter, we continued our buyback plan and repurchased 1.6 million shares for\na total of $13.5 million.\nRevenue from Advertising Solutions was $81.3 million, down 18% year-over-year, yet up 9%\nsequentially, representing 80% of total revenue. The year-over-year decrease was a result of continuous\nand anticipated decline in open web video and in standard display revenue.\nThese declines were partially offset by significant year-over-year increase of our growth engines,\nincluding Digital out-of-home, Retail Media, and CTV.\nOur Digital out-of-home business grew by 63% year-over-year, on a pro forma basis, to $19.1 million,\nrepresenting 23% of our Advertising Solutions revenue, compared with 11% in the same period last year\non a pro forma basis.\nOur CTV business grew by 19% year-over year to $9.5 million, representing 12% of our Advertising\nSolutions revenue, compared with 8% last year.\nBoosted by our Digital out-of home and CTV solutions, our Retail Media business, which is a hyper-\ngrowth market vertical, delivered another strong quarter. Retail Media increased 62% year-over-year to\n$21 million, representing 26% of our Advertising Solutions revenue, compared with 13% in the same\nperiod last year.\nSearch advertising was $20.9 million for the third quarter, down 76% year-over year, representing 20%\nof our total revenue. As mentioned, this decrease was a result of the changes implemented by Microsoft\nBing earlier this year.\nPage 3 of 9\nOur contract with Microsoft Bing, which both currently and going forward represents less than 5% of our\noverall revenue run rate, will not be renewed at its conclusion at the end of 2024. As per the terms of\nthe contract, there is a tail that is expected to generate revenue also in 2025.\nContribution excluding TAC margin was 47%, compared with 42% in the third quarter last year, which is\nprimarily due to changes in the product mix following the reduction in the search business.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $7.4 million, 7% of revenue and 16% of contribution ex-TAC, compared with 23%\nand 55%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2023. The cost reduction and efficiency measures that we\nimplemented last quarter, allowed us to moderate the year-over-year decrease in EBITDA.\nOn a GAAP basis, third quarter net profit was $2.1 million, or four cents per diluted share, compared\nwith a net income of $32.8 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income decreased by 72% to $11.9 million, or 23 cents per diluted share,\ncompared with $42.4 million, or 84 cents per diluted share, last year.\nIn the third quarter, our cash flow from operating activities generated $16.2 million, compared with\n$40.1 million in the same period last year. Perion has a decade-long track record of generating a positive\ncash flow from operation and we expect to continue in this direction in 2024 and going forward.\nAs of September 30th, 2024, net cash including cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and marketable\nsecurities was $383.9 million, down from $407.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2024. The\nquarter-over-quarter decline in cash was primarily the results of an earnout settlement of approximately\n$24 million, related to previous acquisitions.\nGoing forward, we do not expect contingent consideration payments related to past acquisitions other\nthan those of Hivestack. In addition, during this quarter we repurchased 1.6 million shares for a total of\n$13.5 million. As of the end of the third quarter, we repurchased a total of 3.6 million shares, bringing\nthe total spend against our share buyback program to $33.5 million.\nBased on our third quarter results and our expectation for the fourth quarter, we are reiterating the full\nyear 2024 guidance that we provided on our second quarter earnings conference call.\nThis concludes my financial overview. I will now pass it back to the operator for the Q&A. Thank you.\nModerator:\nThank you. If you wish to ask a question, we ask that you please use the raise hand function at the\nbottom of your zoom screen or if you have dialed in, please press star nine. Our first question comes\nfrom Andrew Marok at Raymond James. Please unmute your line and ask your question.\nAndrew Marok:\nHi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe first one on Digital out-of-home. Seeing good growth there in\nthe format, but I guess could you just talk about the progress in making Digital out-of-home just more\nprogrammatic industry-wide, since it still kind of lags some of its other formats?\nTal Jacobson:\nYeah, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So, as you've seen, the growth is pretty amazing, but Digital\nout-of-home continues to grow. Programmatic out of that grows even faster, but when we're looking at\nDigital out-of- home, when we bought Hivestack, we actually combineD that within our Retail solution.\nSo we're powering retailers to also use that, to use that as part of our omnichannel solution to drive\nmore people into physical stores. So, the synergetic solution out of that provides even more growth\nthan just the out-of-home part. I hope that answered your question.\nPage 4 of 9\nAndrew Marok:\nYeah, thank you. Helpful there. And then maybe one quick one if I could on CTV. So, I guess can we just\ntalk about some of the dynamics that are happening there, maybe industry-wide and how they're\naffecting you? Because saw the growth of 19%, but that's a pretty significant decel from 42% last\nquarter and the absolute dollar amount was down year over year or down Q over Q, Excuse me. Just\nwondering if there's anything to read into that. Maybe in terms of CPMs coming down across the space\nas industry proliferates. How does pricing kind of impact your CTV business? Thank you.\nTal Jacobson:\nThank you. Yeah, absolutely. So CPMs are a bit down, but since we're not… when CPMs are down, we're\nbasically buying more inventory. The main reason that the growth was a bit lower than last quarter is\nbecause the main parts of our CTV is live CTV. So less sports events during the summer and September\nactually started to pick up again, but live events on CTV is the main driver, and July, August is just a\nweaker part of the year.\nModerator:\nPerfect. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer. Please unmute your line and\nask your question.\nJason Helfstein:\nHey. I guess good afternoon guys. Two questions. One, when do you think advertising revenue returns\nback to positive growth? Presumably sometime next year, but if you just maybe level set base case\nversus bulk case. And then question number two, where do you see long-term EBITDA margins, ex-TAC,\nand how do you get there? Is it a function of doing things? How much of its revenue versus work you\nneed to do on the cost side? Thank you.\nElad Tzubery:\nSo, hi Jason. Thank you for the question. So for the first question regarding our advertising solutions, we\nbelieve that next year, on Q1, we started to see the year started to get slight increase year over year,\nand in Q2 we started to see it expedited a little bit more. In Q2, we'll see the real growth year over year,\nwe're going to see the entire impact for all the changes that we've made this year. In terms of the\nEBITDA profitability from ex-TAC, I believe that next year we'll end up slightly higher than where we are\ntoday. We are constantly working about efficiency in the organization, improving our EBITDA margins\nand to be able to scale up using our current headcount and our current level of expenses.\nJason Helfstein:\nCan I follow up on that second question then? I mean, do you have to change at all the, I guess, pricing,\nbilling model for advertisers to kind of get to the margins that you have to get to?\nTal Jacobson:\nNo, we don't need to change our pricing model. No, we're scaling with some major advertisers and\nthat's where we're going to see the growth while maintaining the growth with the current headcount.\nJason Helfstein:\nThank you.\nPage 5 of 9\nTal Jacobson:\nThank you.\nModerator:\nOur next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi at Lake Street. Please unmute your line and ask your\nquestion.\nEric Martinuzzi:\nYeah, I wanted to focus on the Microsoft contract. Just to clarify, you said that there will not be a\nrenewal of that contract, but that there will be Microsoft-related revenue in 2025?\nTal Jacobson:\nYes. What was the question?\nEric Martinuzzi:\nYeah. You size the Microsoft revenue in the back half of 24 as 5%. What would you characterize, how\nlong do we have this tail in 2025? Is it done by Q1? What percent of revenue is Microsoft in Q1, Q2?\nTal Jacobson:\nRight. So the agreement with Microsoft has a clause of tail. What that means is the users, the end users\nthat are using the product with the Microsoft engine through us, can continue to use that with us till the\nend of 2025. Now, software users tend to churn. They don't keep that product always. So although we\nhave a tail clause within the agreement, and we expect to generate revenue in 2025, and still we do not\nhave that forecast till the end of 2025, but it's going to be part of our revenue in 2025 as we see it now.\nEric Martinuzzi:\nOkay, so de minimis kind of less than 2% for the full year on revenue, percent of revenue?\nTal Jacobson:\nYeah, we'll try to be more accurate next quarter when we're going to provide a better visibility into next\nyear, but I think that's a, kind of a reasonable assumption, but we'll need to do a deeper analysis.\nEric Martinuzzi:\nGot it. Thanks for taking my question.\nTal Jacobson:\nThank you.\nModerator:\nOur next question comes from Laura Martin at Needham. Please unmute your line and ask your\nquestion.\nLaura Martin:\nPage 6 of 9\nHey, so let's start with Hivestack. You closed it in the fourth quarter of 23, and the idea, the industrial\nlogic was that Undertone had excellent relationships with ad agencies in the US and Hivestack had\nexcellent relationships with ad agencies offshore, and there was synergy there because you could sort\nof, synergy of introducing products across the globe that way. Could you update us on whether that\nindustrial logic is playing out, please?\nTal Jacobson:\nYeah, so on the product side, we've implemented the DCO, which is an Undertone product, which is the\nDynamic Creative Optimization technology. We've implemented that into the Hivestack platform,\nenabling Hivestack advertisers to enjoy 40% more inventory than they used to. What that means is, in\nout-of-home you have so many different sizes of screens and resolutions that advertisers don't really\nbother to create creatives for all those sizes. With that new technology, they can now tap into all the\ninventory, which provides greater growth into our Hivestack platform. So, it does work, and it provides a\nbigger portion of retail advertisers into Perion. So even though we've started less than a year ago, we're\nseeing good synergies between the two sites.\nLaura Martin:\nOkay, helpful. And then my other question is, when you stepped into the CEO role here, Tal, we had\nMicrosoft at 50% of revenue and now it's going to be less than 5%. My question is sitting here today,\nshould you have known that this was coming as the head of the Microsoft relationship, or was just\neverybody blindsided by a strategic pivot that Microsoft made looking back?\nTal Jacobson:\nYeah. Well, let me just say, if I knew to be honest, I wouldn't taken this role. I didn't want this\nundermining, but unfortunately it happened, and it happened industry-wide for Microsoft. It's a decision\nthey took across the board to their other partners, not just Perion, and we were all surprised by this\nchange. Again, if I only knew, but unfortunately, I didn't, I took this role and it's my responsibility now to\nrebuild the entire thing without the Microsoft agreement.\nLaura Martin:\nJust following up on that, we're having weakness in, let me call it the old-line business, which is the\nvideo business and the display business. Do you think the weakness in the core businesses, the ones that\nare more than a year old, is actually related to the same reason that Microsoft left? Is it a quality issue, I\nguess is my question of Perion inventory or are they unrelated?\nTal Jacobson:\nNo, no, absolutely not. It's absolutely not. Microsoft Search had nothing to do with the display\nAdvertising business. It's not connected in any way. Now, some of our parts in the past that we used to\nhave, publisher solution and other parts that the industry moved away from is some of the decline that\nyou're seeing now in the advertising part. But our inventory, as you probably saw in our presentation,\nwe're connected to the premium of the premium inventory of the industry. We're not compromising\nany of our inventory. We're just working with very high-quality inventory. But those two parts are\nunrelated. And there's an article, I think a few months ago that Microsoft are generating a lot of money\nthrough what people call MFA sites and Google as well. So, technology companies and advertising\ncompanies are working with all type of websites, but those two parts were never connected.\nPage 7 of 9\nLaura Martin:\nSuper helpful. Thank you very much.\nTal Jacobson:\nAbsolutely. Thank you.\nModerator:\nOur next question comes from Jeff Martin at Roth. Please unmute your line and ask your question.\nJeff Martin:\nThanks. Good afternoon, guys. Wanted to ask more specifically, what are the trends within the\ntraditional display and video advertising that are impacting you most, yeah, most severely here, and do\nyou see that bottoming out and is there growth potential down the road?\nTal Jacobson:\nYeah, so the main trends we're seeing is open, I would call it open web inventory became less and less\nattractive. You can see that weakness also in the Google reports that YouTube and search are growing\nwhile ad sales, which is the open web, is not doing as good. And I think that's why we're concentrating\nmainly on one, the premium inventory and second, on the omnichannel experience. So we can continue\nto shift between higher margins and more attractive channels. But that's why you're also seeing part of\nour display advertising unit division declining in the past year. We expect next year to be a lot better on\nthat part. We're investing a lot in other channels, and we're now pushing some of our advertisers into\nYouTube and CTV, YouTube both on CTV and web, and those are the growing engines that we're looking\nforward to grow.\nJeff Martin:\nGreat. And then my second question is regarding the Search business. My understanding is that the\nmajority of the residual in Search is with partner Yahoo. I just want to throw it out there, a question,\ncould the same situation that happened with Microsoft Bing happened with Yahoo? Thank you.\nTal Jacobson:\nRight, so we do not see any signals that that might be the case, but again, the search part of Perion, I\nthink we've said that in the past, is not a strategic part. As long as we can get revenue and EBITDA out of\nthat, we'll be more than happy to do this for as many years as possible. But that's not the strategy, that's\nnot the path we're going to, that's not even part of the investments we're doing. We're not investing in\nthat part. We're just, we're working on that part to continue to generate revenue and EBITDA, but the\nmain growth engines, I think that's what's going to take us to new places and to higher growth.\nModerator:\nOur last question comes from Mark Kelley at Stifel. Please unmute your line and ask your question.\nMark Kelley:\nGreat. Thanks very much. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about two different things. One is you\nbrought up The Trade Desk in your prepared remarks when it comes to audio, I guess is that how you're\naccessing audio inventory from a DSP perspective? And then second unrelated question, Tal, you talked\nPage 8 of 9\nabout kind of rebuilding the company after the Search business is essentially close to going away. I\nguess, can you expand on the M&A strategy and some of the thoughts that you have today and maybe if\nthose differ from what we've heard from you in the past? Thank you.\nTal Jacobson:\nYeah. Thank you for the questions. So we're now connected, on the audio part, we are connected to\nSpotify directly and iHeart and others. If an advertiser wants to buy our audio through The Trade Desk,\nthey are more than welcomed to do so with our technology or through any other DSP. So that's on the\naudio part, and I think the fact that The Trade Desk did this deal with Spotify is amazing. I think audio\nhas been unrecognized as a growth engine for so many years, but it's still, a lot of people are using it and\nwe're going to see a great growth on audio in the future. It's still not there, but I think it's a good part to\ninvest in.\nAs for the M&A and the future of the company, I don't think the company is going away any in the\nfuture. I think we need to rebuild everything we do. We still have a lot of money. We're generating good\nEBITDA, we're generating revenue. We have a lot of technology. We have a lot of clients and\npartnerships. It's an amazing company. I think it has an amazing future. And now in terms of M&A, we're\nat the same place. We're looking for to buy more growth engines. The criteria is EBITDA positive,\nsynergetic drives through technology, and that's basically what we're looking for. Does that answer your\nquestion?\nMark Kelley:\nYes. Thank you very much.\nTal Jacobson:\nThank you.\nModerator:\nThis concludes today's call. I will now hand back to management for closing remarks.\nTal Jacobson:\nThank you everyone for joining us at our Q3 earning call. We look forward to having you joining us again\nnext quarter. Thank you.\nPage 9 of 9"

Many factors could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Perion\nto be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, or financial information, including, but not limited to, the\ncurrent war between Israel and Hamas and any worsening of the situation in Israel (such as further mobilizations), the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of companies and businesses we acquired and may\nacquire in the future, risks entailed in integrating the companies and businesses we acquire, including employee retention and customer acceptance; the risk that such transactions will divert management and\nother resources from the ongoing operations of the business or otherwise disrupt the conduct of those businesses, potential litigation associated with such transactions, and general risks associated with the\nbusiness of Perion including intense and frequent changes in the markets in which the businesses operate and in general economic and business conditions, loss of key customers, data breaches, cyber-attacks\nand other similar incidents, unpredictable sales cycles, competitive pressures, market acceptance of new products, changes in applicable laws and regulations as well as industry self-regulation, inability to meet\nefficiency and cost reduction objectives, changes in business strategy and various other factors, whether referenced or not referenced in this presentation. Various other risks and uncertainties may affect Perion\nand its results of operations, as described in reports filed by Perion with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including its annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31,\n2023 filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024. Perion does not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Investors should read this presentation together with our respective quarterly press\nrelease furnished to the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures consist of GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain items. This presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures, including Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA,\nnon-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and Adjusted free cash flow.\nContribution ex-TAC presents revenue reduced by traffic acquisition costs and media buy, reflecting a portion of our revenue that must be directly passed to publishers or advertisers and presents our revenue\nexcluding such items. We believe Contribution ex-TAC is a useful measure in assessing the performance of the Company because it facilitates a consistent comparison against our core business without\nconsidering the impact of traffic acquisition costs and media buy related to revenue reported on a gross basis.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is defined as income from operations excluding stock-based compensation expenses, depreciation, amortization\nof acquired intangible assets, retention and other acquisition-related expenses, restructuring costs and gains and losses recognized with respect to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.\nAdjusted free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (or used in) operating activities less cash used for the purchase of property and equipment, but excluding the purchase of property and equipment\nrelated to our new corporate headquarter office and the portion of the cash payment of contingent consideration in excess of the acquisition date fair value, as we do not view either of those expenses as\nreflective of our normal on-going expenses. It is important to note that these expenses are in fact cash expenditures.\nNon-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are defined as net income and net earnings per share excluding stock-based compensation expenses, retention and other acquisition-related\nexpenses, restructuring costs, revaluation of acquisition-related contingent consideration, amortization of acquired intangible assets and the related taxes thereon, non-recurring expenses, foreign exchange\ngains and losses associated with ASC-842, as well as gains and losses recognized with respect to changes in fair value of contingent consideration.\nThe purpose of such adjustments is to give an indication of our performance exclusive of non-cash charges and other items that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results.\nThese non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Furthermore, the non-GAAP measures are regularly used internally to understand,\nmanage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions, and we believe that they are useful to investors as a consistent and comparable measure of the ongoing performance of our business.\nHowever, our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated\nfinancial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ materially from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Due to the\nhigh variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from these projected measures, together with some of the excluded information not being\nascertainable or accessible, we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required for such presentation without unreasonable effort.

Available globally, Perion’s Anyplace TV enables advertisers to extend their one-to-one video reach beyond traditional video channels to unique one-to-many DOOH environments and improve campaign effectiveness.\n\nIn a landscape where video ad spend is projected to reach $191.3 billion this year, with CTV accounting for $34.4 billion1, Perion’s Anyplace TV introduces an effective approach to video campaign execution. The solution uses Perion’s DOOH impression multiplier methodology via the Hivestack platform, utilizing the Media Rating Council (MRC) accredited measurement from trade organizations in respective markets. This approach bridges the gap between one-to-one and one-to-many environments, enabling advertisers to achieve greater scale and efficiency.\n\n“Video advertising has evolved beyond single-channel strategies, and while running video ads across many channels, including DOOH, is not new, the path to planning and activating across multiple channels can be fragmented,” said Tal Jacobson, Perion’s CEO. “Perion’s Anyplace TV represents a significant step forward in this evolution to streamline the advertiser experience. By unifying DOOH and CTV environments, we’re enabling advertisers to easily maximize the impact of their video assets while achieving superior cost efficiency and guaranteed MRC viewability.”\n\n**Key benefits include** :\n\n  * **Guaranteed Viewability** : Non-skippable ads with 100% viewability and completion rates.\n  * **Extensive Reach** : Access to video-enabled DOOH inventory across 75% of Perion’s Hivestack’s global network of over 1M screens globally.\n  * **Creative Flexibility** : Support for standard 10, 12 and 15-second video spots, with some locations featuring audio capabilities.\n  * **Real-Time Optimization** : Dynamic scheduling and content updates for timely campaign adjustments.\n\n\n\nToday, 75% of Perion’s global DOOH inventory supports video advertising capabilities. Platform data shows consistent adoption of video formats, with video appearing in 22% of global DOOH campaigns over the past year – reaching up to 40% of campaigns in the U.S. market and higher penetration in other regions.\n\nFor more information, contact us [here](https://perion.com/contact-us/).\n\n1 [Statista Video Advertising Market Insights](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-advertising/video-advertising/worldwide), March 2024\n\n**About Perion Network Ltd.**\n\nPerion connects advertisers with consumers through technology across all major digital channels.

(NASDAQ and TASE: PERI), a technology leader in connecting advertisers to consumers across all major digital channels, today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Third-quarter results were in line with our expectations as we continue to capitalize on the strength of DOOH, Retail Media, and CTV,” commented Tal Jacobson, Perion’s CEO. “All three growth engines delivered strong results in the quarter, signaling that our multi-channel strategy is gaining traction with advertisers who trust us to activate their messages across all screens and formats. DOOH, Retail Media and CTV are leading today’s industry trends, and we are committed to developing and introducing new innovative omni-channel solutions that position Perion at the forefront of these high-growth areas.”\n\n“Perion strives to serve its customers at the highest level while profitably growing the business and delivering value to shareholders. We will continue to accomplish this by combining internally developed and integrated technology solutions and adding more successful and synergetic growth engines organically and inorganically. We expect to generate positive operating cash flow in 2024, as we have consistently done since 2014.” concluded Mr. Jacobson.\n\n_1 On a proforma basis_\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Business Highlights_**\n\n  * On a proforma basis, DOOH revenue increased 63% year-over-year to $19.1 million, representing 23% of Advertising Solutions revenue compared to 11% last year.\n  * Retail Media1revenue increased 62% year-over-year to $21.0 million, representing 26% of Advertising Solutions revenue compared to 13% last year.\n  * CTV revenue increased 19% year-over-year to $9.5 million, representing 12% of Advertising Solutions revenue compared to 8% last year.\n  * Open Web2Video revenue decreased 63% year-over-year, representing 14% of Advertising Solutions revenue, compared to 32% last year.\n  * Search Advertising revenue decreased 76% year-over-year to $20.9 million, representing 20% of total company revenue. Our contract with Microsoft Bing, which, as we previously reported, represents less than 5% of our overall revenue run rate both currently and going forward, will not be renewed at its conclusion at the end of 2024. As per the terms of the contract, there is a tail period that is expected to generate revenue in 2025.\n\n\n\n_1 Retail Media revenue include all media channels, such as CTV, DOOH, video and others_\n\n_2 Open Web video refers to standard digital video ad units running on the open web (Websites), and does not include CTV, digital video on social platforms and short-form video_\n\n**_Third_** **_Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights_**** _2_**\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201440%20604'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n**_Financial Outlook 1_**\n\nThe company is reiterating its previously issued full-year 2024 guidance based on current expectations.\n\nFY 2024 Guidance\n\n  * Revenue of $490 to $510 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA2 of $48 to $52 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA2 to contribution ex-TAC2 of 23% at the midpoint\n\n\n\n**_Share Repurchase program_**\n\nAs part of the company’s $75 million share repurchase program announced earlier this year, in the third quarter of 2024, Perion repurchased 1.6 million shares in the amount of approximately $13.5 million. As of the end of the third quarter, the company repurchased a total of 3.6 million shares, bringing the total spend under the share repurchase program to $33.5 million.\n\n_1 We have not provided an outlook for GAAP Income from operations or reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to GAAP Income from operations, the closest corresponding GAAP measure, because we do not provide guidance for certain of the reconciling items on a consistent basis due to the variability and complexity of these items, including but not limited to the measures and effects of our stock-based compensation expenses directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuation in our share price and amortization in connection with future acquisitions. Hence, we are unable to quantify these amounts without unreasonable efforts._\n\n_2 Contribution ex-TAC, non-GAAP Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP Diluted EPS are non-GAAP measures. See below reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures._\n\n**_Financial Comparison for the Third_**** _Quarter of 2024_**\n\n**Revenue:** Revenue decreased by 45% to $102.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $185.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Advertising Solutions revenue decreased 18% year-over-year, accounting for 80% of total revenue, primarily due to a 63% decrease in Video revenue, partially offset by a $18.6 million increase in Digital Out of Home revenue and a 19% year-over-year increase in CTV revenue to $9.5 million. Search Advertising revenue decreased by 76% year-over-year, accounting for 20% of revenue, primarily due to 78% decrease in Average Daily Searches and 71% decrease in the number of publishers, following the changes implemented by Microsoft Bing earlier this year.\n\n**Traffic Acquisition Costs and Media Buy (“TAC”):** TAC amounted to $54.6 million, or 53% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $108.0 million, or 58% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2023. The margin expansion was primarily due to changes in the product mix following the reduction in the Search business\n\n**GAAP Net Income** : GAAP net income decreased by 94% to $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $32.8 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Non-GAAP Net Income** : Non-GAAP net income was $11.9 million, or 12% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $42.4 million, or 23% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2023. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income is included in this press release.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** : Adjusted EBITDA was $7.4 million, or 7% of revenue (and 16% of Contribution ex-TAC) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $42.7 million, or 23% of revenue (and 55% of Contribution ex-TAC) in the third quarter of 2023. A reconciliation of GAAP income from operations to Adjusted EBITDA is included in this press release.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operations** : Net cash used in operating activities in the third quarter of 2024 was $16.2 million, compared with $40.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Net cash** : As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits and marketable securities amounted to $383.9 million, compared with $472.7 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**_Conference Call_**\n\nPerion’s management will host a conference call to discuss the results at 8:30 a.m. ET today:\n\nRegistration link: <https://perion-q3-earnings-call-2024.open-exchange.net/>\n\nA replay of the call and a transcript will be available within approximately 24 hours of the live event on Perion’s [website](https://perion.com/).\n\n**_About Perion Network Ltd._**\n\nPerion connects advertisers with consumers through technology across all major digital channels.

This press release includes certain non-GAAP measures, including Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earning per share.\n\nContribution ex-TAC presents revenue reduced by traffic acquisition costs and media buy, reflecting a portion of our revenue that must be directly passed to publishers or advertisers and presents our revenue excluding such items. We believe Contribution ex-TAC is a useful measure in assessing the performance of the Company because it facilitates a consistent comparison against our core business without considering the impact of traffic acquisition costs and media buy related to revenue reported on a gross basis.\n\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is defined as income from operations excluding stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring costs, depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, retention and other acquisition-related expenses and gains and losses recognized with respect to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.\n\nNon-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are defined as net income and net earnings per share excluding stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring costs, retention and other acquisition-related expenses, revaluation of acquisition-related contingent consideration, amortization of acquired intangible assets and the related taxes thereon, non-recurring expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses associated with ASC-842, as well as gains and losses recognized with respect to changes in fair value of contingent consideration.\n\nThe purpose of such adjustments is to give an indication of our performance exclusive of non-cash charges and other items that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Furthermore, the non-GAAP measures are regularly used internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions, and we believe that they are useful to investors as a consistent and comparable measure of the ongoing performance of our business. However, our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ materially from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from these projected measures, together with some of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible, we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required for such presentation without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included in this press release. A reconciliation between results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in the last table of this press release.\n\n**_Forward Looking Statements_**\n\nThis press release contains historical information and forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the business, financial condition and results of operations of Perion.
