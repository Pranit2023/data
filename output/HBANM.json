Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as expect,\nanticipate, believe, intend, estimate, plan, target, goal, or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such\nas will, may, might, should, would, could, or similar variations. The forward-looking statements are intended to\nbe subject to the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n11\nWhile there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are\ncertain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the\nforward-looking statements: changes in general economic, political, or industry conditions; deterioration in\nbusiness and economic conditions, including persistent inflation, supply chain issues or labor shortages,\ninstability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets; the\nimpact of pandemics and other catastrophic events or disasters on the global economy and financial market\nconditions and our business, results of operations, and financial condition; the impacts related to or resulting\nfrom bank failures and other volatility, including potential increased regulatory requirements and costs, such as\nFDIC special assessments, long-term debt requirements and heightened capital requirements, and potential\nimpacts to macroeconomic conditions, which could affect the ability of depository institutions, including us, to\nattract and retain depositors and to borrow or raise capital; unexpected outflows of uninsured deposits which\nmay require us to sell investment securities at a loss; changing interest rates which could negatively impact the\nvalue of our portfolio of investment securities; the loss of value of our investment portfolio which could\nnegatively impact market perceptions of us and could lead to deposit withdrawals; the effects of social media on\nmarket perceptions of us and banks generally; cybersecurity risks; uncertainty in U.S. fiscal and monetary policy,\nincluding the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve; volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit\nmarkets; movements in interest rates; competitive pressures on product pricing and services; success, impact,\nand timing of our business strategies, including market acceptance of any new products or services including\nthose implementing our “Fair Play” banking philosophy; changes in policies and standards for regulatory review\nof bank mergers; the nature, extent, timing, and results of governmental actions, examinations, reviews,\nreforms, regulations, and interpretations, including those related to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, as well as those involving the OCC, Federal\nReserve, FDIC, and CFPB; and other factors that may affect the future results of Huntington. Additional factors\nthat could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in Huntington’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the\nquarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, which are on file with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”) and available in the “Investor Relations” section of Huntington’s website http://\nwww.huntington.com, under the heading “Publications and Filings” and in other documents Huntington files\nwith the SEC.\nAll forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information\navailable at that time. Huntington does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements to\nreflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements were made or to\nreflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws. As forward-looking\nstatements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance\non such statements.\nBasis of Presentation\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis document contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management\nbelieves it to be helpful in understanding Huntington’s results of operations or financial position. Where non-\nGAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the\ncomparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this document, the financial supplement, conference call\nslides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of\nHuntington’s website, http://www.huntington.com.\nAnnualized Data\nCertain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an “annualized”\nbasis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends\nwhen compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as\nnet charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth\nrate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.\n12\nFully-Taxable Equivalent Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nIncome from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have\nbeen paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most\nnotably tax-exempt municipal securities, and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison\nof results to results of competitors.\nRounding\nPlease note that items in this document may not add due to rounding.\nNotable Items\nFrom time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by management to be outside\nof ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking\nactivities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by management at that time to be\ninfrequent or short term in nature. We refer to such items as “Notable Items.” Management believes it is useful\nto consider certain financial metrics with and without Notable Items, in order to enable a better understanding\nof company results, increase comparability of period-to-period results, and to evaluate and forecast those\nresults.\n13\nExhibit 99.2\nHUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED\nQuarterly Financial Supplement\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTable of Contents\nQuarterly Key Statistics 1\nYear to Date Key Statistics 2\nConsolidated Balance Sheets 4\nLoans and Leases Composition 5\nDeposits Composition 6\nConsolidated Quarterly Average Balance Sheets 7\nConsolidated Quarterly Net Interest Margin - Interest Income / Expense 8\nConsolidated Quarterly Net Interest Margin - Yield 9\nSelected Quarterly Income Statement Data 10\nQuarterly Mortgage Banking Noninterest Income 11\nQuarterly Credit Reserves Analysis 12\nQuarterly Net Charge-Off Analysis 13\nQuarterly Nonaccrual Loans and Leases (NALs) and Nonperforming Assets (NPAs) 14\nQuarterly Accruing Past Due Loans and Leases 15\nQuarterly Capital Under Current Regulatory Standards (Basel III) and Other Capital Data 16\nQuarterly Common Stock Summary, Non-Regulatory Capital, and Other Data 17\nConsolidated Year to Date Average Balance Sheets 18\nConsolidated Year to Date Net Interest Margin - Interest Income / Expense 19\nConsolidated Year to Date Net Interest Margin - Yield 20\nSelected Year to Date Income Statement Data 21\nYear to Date Mortgage Banking Noninterest Income 22\nYear to Date Credit Reserves Analysis 23\nYear to Date Net Charge-Off Analysis 24\nYear to Date Nonaccrual Loans and Leases (NALs) and Nonperforming Assets (NPAs) 25\nNotes:\nThe preparation of financial statement data in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFully-Taxable Equivalent Basis\nInterest income, yields, and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income\non a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to\nassess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of\n21%.\nNon-Regulatory Capital Ratios\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital\nutilization and adequacy, including:\n• Tangible common equity to tangible assets, and\n• Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets using Basel III definition.\nThese non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to\nwithstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the Company’s capitalization\nto other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator\nexcludes preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not\ndefined in GAAP or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered\nnon-GAAP financial measures.\nBecause there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company’s calculation methods may differ from\nthose used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the\nCompany encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in the related\npress release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nHuntington Bancshares Incorporated\nQuarterly Key Statistics\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30, Percent Changes vs.\n(dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) 2024 2024 2023 2Q24 3Q23\nNet interest income (1) $ 1,364 $ 1,325 $ 1,379 3 % (1) %\nFTE adjustment (13) (13) (11) — (18)\nNet interest income 1,351 1,312 1,368 3 (1)\nProvision for credit losses 106 100 99 6 7\nNoninterest income 523 491 509 7 3\nNoninterest expense 1,130 1,117 1,090 1 4\nIncome before income taxes 638 586 688 9 (7)\nProvision for income taxes 116 106 136 9 (15)\nIncome after income taxes 522 480 552 9 (5)\nIncome attributable to non-controlling interest 5 6 5 (17) —\nNet income attributable to Huntington 517 474 547 9 (5)\nDividends on preferred shares 36 35 37 3 (3)\nNet income applicable to common shares $ 481 $ 439 $ 510 10 % (6)\nNet income per common share -

Huntington elected to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital, utilizing a two-year delay followed by a\nthree-year transition period. January 1, 2022 began the three-year transition period, whereby 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25%\nof the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL will be recognized over the three-year transition period. As\nof September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, 75% of the cumulative CECL deferral has been phased in. As of December 31, 2023 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, 50% of the cumulative CECL deferral has been phased in.\n(3) Huntington believes certain non-GAAP financial measures to be helpful in understanding Huntington’s results of operations.
