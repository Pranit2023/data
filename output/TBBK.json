Reports its Third Quarter Financial Results\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s27.q4cdn.com/928525813/files/doc_news/The-Bancorp-Inc.-Reports-its-Third-Quarter-Financial-Results-2024.pdf)\n\nWILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  The Bancorp, Inc. (“The Bancorp” or the “Company” or “we” or “our”) (NASDAQ: TBBK), a financial holding company, today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. \n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 amounted to $51.5 million. \n\n**Factors Helpful to Understand Third Quarter Net Income**\n\n  1. As explained under recent developments below, a new CECL factor was added which increased the provision for credit losses and resulted in an after-tax reduction in net income of $1.5 million. \n  2. Prior period interest income reversals on real estate bridge loans transferred to nonaccrual or modified, resulted in an after-tax reduction in net income of $1.2 million. \n  3. A loss resulting from a transaction processing delay increased non-interest expense and resulted in an after-tax reduction in net income of approximately $900,000. \n\n\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nAs noted in our second quarter press release, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for an apartment property acquired by its wholly-owned subsidiary The Bancorp Bank, National Association, (the “Bank”) through foreclosure in connection with a real estate bridge lending (“REBL”) loan. At September 30, 2024, the related $40.3 million balance, comprised the majority of our other real estate owned. Subsequent to the previously reported $125,000 earnest money deposit in July 2024, the purchaser has made additional earnest money deposits of $250,000 bringing the total of such deposits to $375,000 in 2024. Additional required deposits are projected to total $500,000 prior to the December 31, 2024 closing deadline. The sales price is expected to cover the Company’s current other real estate owned balance plus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, earnest money deposits would accrue to the Company. \n\nWhile real estate bridge loans classified as either special mention or substandard increased during the quarter, we believe that such classifications are at or near their peak. That conclusion is based, at least in part, on an independent review of a significant portion of the REBL portfolio performed during the third quarter by a firm specializing in such analysis. Additionally, the 50 basis point Federal Reserve rate reduction may provide immediate cash flow benefits to borrowers, while the further declining forward yield curve should support further liquidity benefits, as fixed rates decline. Moreover, respective weighted average “as is” and “as stabilized” loan-to-values ratios (“LTVs”) of 77% and 68%, respectively, based upon appraisals in the past twelve months, continue to provide significant protection against loss. Underlying property values as supported by such independent LTVs, continue to facilitate the recapitalization of certain loans from borrowers experiencing cash flow issues, to borrowers with greater financial capacity. At September 30, 2024, real estate bridge loans classified as special mention and substandard respectively amounted to $84.4 million and $155.4 million compared to $96.0 million and $80.4 million at June 30, 2024. Each classified loan was evaluated for a potential increase in the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on the basis of the aforementioned third-party appraisals of apartment building collateral. On the basis of “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs, increases to the allowance were not required. The current allowance for credit losses for REBL, is primarily based upon historical industry losses for multi-family loans, in the absence of significant charge-offs within the Company’s REBL portfolio. However, as noted in our second quarter press release, as a result of increasing amounts of loans classified as special mention and substandard, the Company evaluated potential related sensitivity for REBL in the third quarter. Such evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to change as more information becomes available. As a result, the Company added the aforementioned new qualitative factor to its quarterly ACL with a cumulative after-tax impact of approximately $1.5 million ($2.0 million pre-tax). \n\n**Highlights**\n\n  * The Bancorp reported net income of $51.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share (“EPS”), for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $50.1 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, or an EPS increase of 13%. While net income increased 3% between these periods, outstanding shares were decreased as a result of common share repurchases, which significantly increased in 2024. \n\n\n  * Return on assets and return on equity for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 2.5% and 26%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 26%, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (all percentages “annualized”). \n\n\n  * Net interest income increased 5% to $93.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $88.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Third quarter 2024 net interest income was reduced by the reversal of $1.6 million ($1.2 million, net of tax) of prior period interest related to both real estate bridge loans transferred to non-accrual status during the quarter and loan modifications with retroactive rate reductions. \n\n\n  * Net interest margin amounted to 4.78% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.07% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and 4.97% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Net interest margin for third quarter 2024 was reduced by the prior period interest reversals noted directly above. \n\n\n  * Loans, net of deferred fees and costs were $5.91 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $5.36 billion at December 31, 2023 and $5.20 billion at September 30, 2023. Those changes reflected an increase of 5% quarter over linked quarter and an increase of 14% year over year. \n\n\n  * Gross dollar volume (“GDV”), representing the total amounts spent on prepaid and debit cards, increased $4.93 billion, or 15%, to $37.90 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflects continued organic growth with existing partners and the impact of clients added within the past year. Total prepaid, debit card, ACH, and other payment fees increased 16% to $27.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Consumer credit fintech fees amounted to $1.6 million for the third quarter 2024, as a result of our initial entry into credit sponsorship in 2024. \n\n\n  * Small business loans (“SBLs”), including those held at fair value, amounted to $979.2 million at September 30, 2024, or 14% higher year over year, and 2% higher quarter over linked quarter, excluding the impact of $28.5 million of loans with related secured borrowings. \n\n\n  * Direct lease financing balances increased 6% year over year to $711.8 million at September 30, 2024, and less than 1% over June 30, 2024. \n\n\n  * At September 30, 2024, real estate bridge loans of $2.19 billion had grown 3% compared to a $2.12 billion balance at June 30, 2024, and 18% compared to the September 30, 2023 balance of $1.85 billion. These real estate bridge loans consist entirely of rehabilitation loans for apartment buildings. \n\n\n  * Security backed lines of credit (“SBLOC”), insurance backed lines of credit (“IBLOC”), and investment advisor financing loans collectively decreased 7% year over year and less than 1% quarter over linked quarter to $1.79 billion at September 30, 2024. \n\n\n  * The average interest rate on $7.23 billion of average deposits and interest-bearing liabilities during the third quarter of 2024 was 2.54%. Average deposits of $7.01 billion for the third quarter of 2024 increased $720.9 million, or 11% over third quarter 2023. \n\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, tier 1 capital to average assets (leverage), tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets and common equity tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratios were 9.86%, 13.62%, 14.19% and 13.62%, respectively, compared to well-capitalized minimums of 5%, 8%, 10% and 6.5%, respectively. The Bancorp Bank, National Association, remains well capitalized under banking regulations. \n\n\n  * Book value per common share at September 30, 2024 was $16.90 compared to $14.36 per common share at September 30, 2023, an increase of 18%. \n\n\n  * The Bancorp repurchased 1,037,069 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $48.21 per share during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. As a result of share repurchases, outstanding shares at September 30, 2024 amounted to 48.2 million, compared to 53.2 million shares at December 31, 2023, or a reduction of 9%. \n\n\n  * The Bancorp emphasizes safety and soundness and its balance sheet has a risk profile enhanced by the special nature of the collateral supporting its loan niches, related underwriting, and the characteristics of its funding sources, including those highlighted in the bullets below. Those loan niches and funding sources have contributed to increased earnings levels, even during periods in which markets have experienced various economic stresses. \n\n\n  * The vast majority of The Bancorp’s funding is comprised of FDIC-insured and/or small balance accounts, which adjust to only a portion of changes in rates. The Company also has lines of credit with U.S. government sponsored agencies totaling approximately $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, as well as access to other forms of liquidity. \n\n\n  * In its REBL portfolio, the Company has minimal exposure to non-multifamily commercial real estate such as office buildings, and instead has a portfolio largely comprised of rehabilitation bridge loans for apartment buildings. These loans generally have three-year terms with two one-year extensions to allow for the rehabilitation work to be completed and rentals stabilized for an extended period, before being refinanced at lower rates through U.S. Government Sponsored Entities or other lenders. The REBL portfolio consists primarily of workforce housing, which we consider to be working class apartments at more affordable rental rates. Related collateral values should accordingly be more stable than higher rent properties, even in stressed economies. While the macro-economic environment has challenged the multifamily bridge space, the stability of the Company’s REBL portfolio is evidenced by the estimated values of the underlying collateral. The Company’s $2.2 billion apartment bridge lending portfolio at September 30, 2024, has a weighted average origination date “as is” loan-to-value ratio of 70%, based on third-party appraisals. Further, the weighted average origination date “as stabilized” LTV, which measures the estimated value of the apartments after the rehabilitation is complete may provide even greater protection. \n\n\n  * As part of the underwriting process, The Bancorp reviews prospective borrowers’ previous rehabilitation experience in addition to overall financial wherewithal. These transactions also include significant borrower equity contributions with required performance metrics. Underwriting generally includes, but is not limited to, assessment of local market information relating to vacancy and rental rates, review of post rehabilitation rental rate assumptions against geo-specific affordability indices, negative news searches, lien searches, visitations by bank personnel and/or designated engineers, and other information sources. \n\n\n  * Rehabilitation progress is monitored through ongoing draw requests and financial reporting covenants. This generally allows for early identification of potential issues, and expedited action to address on a timely basis. \n\n\n  * Operations and ongoing loan evaluation are overseen by multiple levels of management, in addition to the REBL team’s experienced professional staff and third-party consultants utilized during the underwriting and asset management process. This oversight includes a separate loan committee specific to REBL, which is comprised of seasoned and experienced lending professionals who do not directly report to anyone on the REBL team. There is also a separate loan review department, a surveillance committee and additional staff which evaluate potential losses under the current expected credit losses methodology (“CECL”), all of which similarly do not report to anyone on the REBL team. \n\n\n  * SBLOC and IBLOC portfolios are respectively secured by marketable securities and the cash value of life insurance. The majority of SBA 7(a) loans are government guaranteed, while SBA 504 loans are made with 50%-60% LTVs. \n\n\n  * Additional details regarding our loan portfolios are included in the related tables in this press release, as is the summarization of the earnings contributions of our payments businesses, which further enhances The Bancorp’s risk profile. The Company’s risk profile inherent in its loan portfolios, funding and earnings levels, may present opportunities to further increase stockholder value, while still prudently maintaining capital levels. \n\n\n  * In the second quarter of 2024, the Company purchased approximately $900 million of fixed rate government sponsored entity backed commercial and residential mortgage securities of varying maturities, with an approximate 5.11% weighted average yield, and estimated weighted average lives of eight years, to reduce its exposure to lower levels of net interest income. Such purchases would also reduce the additional net interest income which will result if the Federal Reserve increases rates. While there are many variables and limitations to estimating exposure to changes in rates, such purchases and continuing fixed rate loan originations are projected to reduce such exposure to modest levels. In prior years, The Bancorp deferred adding fixed rate securities when yields were particularly low, which has afforded the flexibility to benefit from, and secure, more advantageous securities and loan rates. \n\n\n\n“We saw strong growth in the third quarter across our Fintech Solutions activities with a robust pipeline,” said Damian Kozlowski, CEO of The Bancorp. “We expect this growth to support an increase in profitability in 2025 and continued gains in EPS. We are issuing preliminary guidance of $5.25 a share for 2025. This 2025 guidance does not include the impact of planned stock buybacks of $150 million. Guidance for 2024 remains $4.35, which includes the positive impact of buybacks during the year. Planned stock buybacks are being reduced in 2025 by $100 million from 2024 levels of $250 million to facilitate the currently planned repayment of senior secured debt of $96 million.” \n\n**Conference Call Webcast**\n\nYou may access the LIVE webcast of The Bancorp's Quarterly Earnings Conference Call at 8:00 AM ET Friday, October 25, 2024, by clicking on the webcast link on The Bancorp's homepage at [www.thebancorp.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebancorp.com&esheet=54140331&newsitemid=20241022908019&lan=en-US&anchor=www.thebancorp.com&index=1&md5=126d4d5f147469633b37f9361c9637df) or you may dial 1.800.225.9448, conference code BANCORP.

In addition to “as is” origination date appraisals, on which the weighted average origination date LTVs are based, third-party appraisers also estimated “as stabilized” values, which represents additional potential collateral value as rehabilitation progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental rates.

While the value of equities has fallen in excess of 30% in recent years, the reduction in collateral value of brokerage accounts collateralizing SBLOC loans generally has been less, for two reasons. First, many collateral accounts are “balanced” and accordingly have a component of debt securities, which have either not decreased in value as much as equities, or in some cases may have increased in value. Second, many of these accounts have the benefit of professional investment advisors who provided some protection against market downturns, through diversification and other means. Additionally, borrowers often utilize only a portion of collateral value, which lowers the percentage of principal to collateral. \n\n**Top 10 SBLOC loans at September 30, 2024**  \n---  \nPrincipal amount  |  % Principal to collateral   \n(Dollars in millions)   \n$  |  9  |  41%   \n8  |  84%   \n8  |  62%   \n8  |  63%   \n7  |  44%   \n5  |  57%   \n5  |  65%   \n5  |  58%   \n5  |  56%   \n5  |  43%   \nTotal and weighted average  |  $  |  65  |  58%   \n  \n**Insurance backed lines of credit (IBLOC)**\n\nIBLOC loans are backed by the cash value of eligible life insurance policies which have been assigned to us.

This loan had a prior six-month payment deferral granted in the fourth quarter of 2024 and did not resume making payments. The table above does not include an $11.2 million loan accounted for at fair value, and, as such, not reflected in delinquency tables. In third quarter 2024, the borrower notified the Company that he would no longer be making payments on the loan, which is collateralized by a vacant retail property. Based upon a July 2024 appraisal, the “as is” LTV is 84% and the “as stabilized” LTV is 62%. Since 2021, real estate bridge lending originations have consisted of apartment buildings, while this loan was originated previously.   \n---  \n  \n**Other loan information**\n\nOf the $84.4 million special mention and $155.4 million substandard loans at September 30, 2024, $55.3 million were modified in the third quarter of 2024 and received reductions in interest rates and payment deferrals. Included in that total was $26.9 million which had been modified in first quarter 2024 with a six-month payment deferral. The third quarter additional modification was for an additional three-month payment deferral and a partial nine-month payment deferral. Not included in that modification total were $19.3 million which was recapitalized with a new borrower, who negotiated a partial interest deferral and rate reduction, and $37.3 million which is accounted for at fair value, and as such, not reflected in modification totals. While payment deferrals have generally been for three to twelve months, that loan was granted a 15-month payment deferral, followed by a nine-month partial payment deferral, in addition to an interest rate reduction. Going forward, the Company will not be accruing interest on this loan. The weighted average “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs for the $19.3 million balance were 72% and 68%, respectively, while those LTVs for the $37.3 million were 73% and 65%, respectively. Those respective LTVs for the $26.9 million loan were 65% and 61%. These LTVs are based upon appraisals performed within the past twelve months. \n\n**Other real estate owned year to date activity**  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024   \nBeginning balance  |  $  |  16,949   \nTransfer from loans, net  |  42,120   \nTransfer from commercial loans, at fair value  |  1,744   \nAdvances  |  926   \nEnding balance  |  $  |  61,739   \nSeptember 30,  |  June 30,  |  December 31,  |  September 30,   \n---|---|---|---  \n2024  |  2024  |  2023  |  2023   \n(Dollars in thousands)   \n**Asset quality ratios:**  \nNonperforming loans to total loans (1) |  0.52%  |  0.34%  |  0.25%  |  0.30%   \nNonperforming assets to total assets (1) |  1.14%  |  0.95%  |  0.39%  |  0.46%   \nAllowance for credit losses to total loans  |  0.52%  |  0.51%  |  0.51%  |  0.46%   \n(1)  In the first quarter of 2024, a $39.4 million apartment building rehabilitation bridge loan with a September 30, 2024 balance of $40.3 million was transferred to nonaccrual status. On April 2, 2024, the same loan was transferred from nonaccrual status to other real estate owned. We intend to complete the improvements, which have already begun, on the underlying apartment building. During the time that improvements are being completed, the Company intends to have a property manager lease improved units as they become available, prior to the sale of the property. The $40.3 million loan balance compares to a September 2023 third-party “as is” appraisal of $47.8 million, or an 84% “as is” LTV, with additional potential collateral value as construction progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental rates.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Organization and Nature of Operations\nThe Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation and a registered financial holding company. Its primary, wholly-owned subsidiary is The\nBancorp Bank, National Association (the “Bank”). The Bank is a nationally chartered commercial bank located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and is a Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured institution. As a nationally chartered bank, its primary regulator is the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (“OCC”). The Bank has two primary lines of business consisting of its national specialty finance segment and its payments segment.\nIn the national specialty finance segment, the Bank makes the following types of loans: securities-backed lines of credit (“SBLOCs”), cash value of insurance-\nbacked lines of credit (“IBLOCs”) and investment advisor financing; leases (direct lease financing); small business loans (“SBLs”), consisting primarily of\nSmall Business Administration (“SBA”) loans; and non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans (“REBLs”). Consumer fintech lending is reflected in the\npayments segment.\nWhile the national specialty finance segment generates the majority of the Company’s revenues, the payments segment also contributes significant revenues. In\nits payments segment, the Company provides payment and deposit services nationally, which include prepaid and debit card accounts, affinity group banking,\ndeposit accounts to investment advisors’ customers, card payments and other payment processing services. Payments segment deposits fund the majority of the\nCompany’s loans and securities and may produce lower costs than other funding sources. Most of the payments segment’s revenues and deposits, and SBLOC\nand IBLOC loans, result from relationships with third parties which market such products. Concentrations of loans and deposits are based upon the cumulative\naccount balances generated by those third parties. Similar concentrations result in revenues in prepaid, debit card and related fees. These concentrations may\nalso be reflected in a lower cost of funds compared to other funding sources. The Company sweeps certain deposits off its balance sheet to other institutions\nthrough intermediaries. Such sweeps are utilized to optimize diversity within its funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to\ntotal deposits.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to regulation by certain state and federal agencies and, accordingly, they are examined periodically by those regulatory\nauthorities. As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities, the Company’s and the Bank’s businesses are affected by state and\nfederal legislation and regulations.\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements of the Company, as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are\nunaudited. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). However, in the opinion of management, these interim financial statements include all\nnecessary adjustments to fairly present the results of the interim periods presented. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023\nForm 10-K”). The results of operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for\nthe full year ending December 31, 2024.\nThere have been no significant changes as of September 30, 2024 from the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nNote 3. Stock-based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 718 Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). The fair value of the option or RSU is generally measured at fair\nvalue at the grant date with compensation expense recognized over the service period, which is typically the stated vesting period. For option grants subject to a\nservice condition, the Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of such options on the date of grant. The Black-\nScholes model takes into consideration the exercise price and expected life of the options, the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility,\nthe expected dividends on the stock and the current risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the option. The Company’s estimate of the fair value of a stock\noption is based on expectations derived from historical experience and may not necessarily equate to its market value when fully vested. In accordance with\nASC 718, the Company estimates the number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. At September 30, 2024, the Company had\nthree active stock-based compensation plans.\n9\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 45,616 stock options with a vesting period of four years and a weighted average\ngrant-date fair value of $21.92. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company granted 57,573 stock options with a vesting period of four\nyears and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $17.37. There were no common stock options exercised in the nine-month period ended September 30,\n2024. There were 13,158 stock options exercised in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.\nA summary of the Company’s stock options is presented below.\nWeighted average\nremaining\nWeighted average contractual Aggregate\nOptions exercise price term (years) intrinsic value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 622,677 $ 15.35 6.90 $ 14,453,641\nGranted 45,616 43.89 9.37 —\nExercised — — — —\nExpired — — — —\nForfeited — — — —\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 668,293 $ 17.30 6.37 $ 24,194,806\nExercisable at September 30, 2024 504,497 $ 12.00 5.83 $ 20,938,696\nThe Company granted 390,305 RSUs in the first nine months of 2024, of which 355,965 have a vesting period of three years and 34,340 have a vesting period\nof one year. At issuance, the 390,305 RSUs granted in the first nine months of 2024 had a weighted average fair value of $42.87 per unit. The Company granted\n547,556 RSUs in the first nine months of 2023, of which 514,785 had a vesting period of three years and 32,771 had a vesting period of one year. At issuance,\nthe 547,556 RSUs granted in the first nine months of 2023 had a weighted average fair value of $35.00 per unit.\nA summary of the Company’s RSUs is presented below.\nWeighted average Average remaining\ngrant date contractual\nRSUs fair value term (years)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 752,255 $ 32.53 1.66\nGranted 390,305 42.87 2.21\nVested (345,390) 30.39 —\nForfeited — — —\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 797,170 $ 38.27 1.68\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was a total of $23.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards under stock-based compensation\nplans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.5 years. Related compensation expense for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $3.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Related compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 was $11.0 million and $8.7 million, respectively. The total issuance date fair value of RSUs vested and options exercised during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $10.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised and RSUs vested in\nthose respective periods was $14.8 million and $16.8 million, respectively.\nFor the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company estimated the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the\nBlack-Scholes options pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nRisk-free interest rate 4.17% 3.67%\nExpected dividend yield — —\nExpected volatility 44.76% 45.21%\nExpected lives (years) 6.3 6.3\nExpected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock and peer group comparisons over the expected life of the option. The risk-free\nrate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities\n(“STRIPS”) rate in effect at the time of the grant. The life of the option is based on historical factors which include the contractual term, vesting period, exercise\nbehavior and employee terminations. In accordance with ASC 718, stock- based compensation expense for the period ended September 30, 2024 is based on\nawards that are ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates forfeitures using historical data or acceptable\nexpedients.\n10\nNote 4. Earnings Per Share\nThe Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by\ndividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into\naccount the potential dilution that could occur if securities, including stock options and RSUs or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and\nconverted into common stock. Stock options are dilutive if their exercise prices are less than the current stock price. RSUs are dilutive because they represent\ngrants over vesting periods which do not require employees to pay exercise prices. The dilution shown in the tables below includes the potential dilution from\nboth stock options and RSUs.\nThe following tables show the Company’s earnings per share for the periods presented:\nFor the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nIncome Shares Per share\n(numerator) (denominator) amount\n(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)\nBasic earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 51,517 48,759,369 $ 1.06\nEffect of dilutive securities\nCommon stock options and RSUs — 718,867 (0.02)\nDiluted earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 51,517 49,478,236 $ 1.04\nStock options for 622,677 shares, exercisable at prices between $6.87 and $35.17 per share, were outstanding at September 30, 2024, and included in the diluted\nearnings per share computation because their exercise price per share was less than the average market price for the three month period ended September 30,\n2024.

Investment Securities\nFair values of available-for-sale securities are based on the fair market values supplied by a third-party market data provider, or where such third-party market\ndata is not available, fair values are based on discounted cash flows. The third-party market data provider uses a pricing matrix which it creates daily, taking\ninto consideration actual trade data, projected prepayments, and when relevant, projected credit defaults and losses.\nThe amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair values of the Company’s investment securities classified as available-for-sale at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\nAvailable-for-sale September 30, 2024\nGross Gross Allowance\nAmortized unrealized unrealized for Fair\ncost gains losses Credit Losses value\nU.S. Government agency securities $ 31,622 $ 114 $ (718) $ — $ 31,018\nAsset-backed securities(1) 236,794 157 (27) — 236,924\nTax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions 7,860 97 (26) — 7,931\nTaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions 35,366 12 (371) — 35,007\nResidential mortgage-backed securities 448,761 18,536 (3,689) — 463,608\nCollateralized mortgage obligation securities 29,433 — (940) — 28,493\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities 775,393 21,544 (11,629) — 785,308\nCorporate debt securities 10,000 — — (10,000) —\n$ 1,575,229 $ 40,460 $ (17,400) $ (10,000) $ 1,588,289\nSeptemb er 3 0, 2 024\nGross Gross\nAmortized unrealized unrealized Fair\n(1)Asset-backed securities as shown above cost gains losses value\nFederally insured student loan securities $ 2,754 $ — $ (6) $ 2,748\nCollateralized loan obligation securities 234,040 157 (21) 234,176\n$ 236,794 $ 157 $ (27) $ 236,924\nAvailable-for-sale December 31, 2023\nGross Gross Allowance\nAmortized unrealized unrealized for Fair\ncost gains losses Credit Losses value\nU.S. Government agency securities $ 35,346 $ 6 $ (1,466) $ — $ 33,886\nAsset-backed securities(1) 327,159 9 (1,815) — 325,353\nTax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions 4,860 39 (48) — 4,851\nTaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions 43,323 15 (952) — 42,386\nResidential mortgage-backed securities 169,882 108 (9,223) — 160,767\nCollateralized mortgage obligation securities 35,575 — (1,537) — 34,038\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities 157,759 — (11,506) — 146,253\nCorporate debt securities 10,000 — — (10,000) —\n$ 783,904 $ 177 $ (26,547) $ (10,000) $ 747,534\n12\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Gross\nAmortized unrealized unrealized Fair\n(1)Asset-backed securities as shown above cost gains losses value\nFederally insured student loan securities $ 6,032 $ — $ (49) $ 5,983\nCollateralized loan obligation securities 321,127 9 (1,766) 319,370\n$ 327,159 $ 9 $ (1,815) $ 325,353\nInvestments in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock, Atlantic Central Bankers Bank (“ACBB”) stock, and Federal Reserve Bank stock are recorded at\ncost and amounted to $21.7 million at September 30, 2024, and $15.6 million at December 31, 2023. At each of those dates, ACBB stock amounted to $40,000.\nThe amount of FHLB stock required to be held is based on the amount of borrowings, and after repayment thereof, the stock may be redeemed.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of the Company’s investment securities at September 30, 2024, by contractual maturity, are shown below (dollars in\nthousands).

There were no gross realized gains on sales of securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand September 30, 2023. There were no realized losses on securities sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

At September 30, 2024, this security had a cost basis of $10.0 million, and comprises the balance of the corporate debt securities classification in the\ntables above. The Bank provided for a potential loss for the full amount of the $10.0 million par value of the trust preferred security through a provision for\ncredit loss of $10.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Interest payments on the trust preferred security have been deferred, as permitted by its terms for\nperiods up to five years. While the trust preferred security has previously been subject to interest deferral which was repaid, there can be no assurance that\nrepayment will occur for the current deferral. The Company has evaluated the securities in the above tables as of September 30, 2024 and has concluded that,\nexcept for the trust preferred security discussed above, none of these securities required an allowance for credit loss (“ACL”).\nThe Company evaluates whether an ACL is required by considering primarily the following factors: (a) the extent to which the fair value is less than the\namortized cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on\ncontractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) changes in the financial condition of the security’s underlying collateral and (e) the payment\nstructure of the security. The Company’s determination of the best estimate of expected future cash flows, which is used to determine the credit loss amount, is a\nquantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with internal assumptions and judgments regarding\nthe future performance of the security. With the exception of the trust preferred security discussed above and the CRE-2 security discussed in “Note 6. Loans,”\nthe Company concluded that the securities that are in an unrealized loss position are in a loss position because of changes in market interest rates after the\nsecurities were purchased. The severity of the impact of fair value in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments is consistent with market\ndevelopments. The Company’s analysis of each investment is performed at the security level. The Company intends to hold its investment securities to maturity,\nand it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery.\nNote 6. Loans\nThe Company has several lending lines of business including: SBLs, comprised primarily of SBA loans; direct lease financing primarily for commercial\nvehicles and to a lesser extent equipment; SBLOC collateralized by marketable securities; IBLOC collateralized by the cash value of eligible life insurance\npolicies; and investment advisor financing for purposes of debt refinance, acquisition of another firm or internal succession. In 2024, the Company began\nmaking consumer fintech loans which consist of short-term extensions of credit including secured credit card loans made in conjunction with marketers and\nservicers. Prior to 2020, the Company also originated non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans, primarily collateralized by multifamily properties\n(apartment buildings), and to a lesser extent, by hotel and retail properties, for sale into securitizations. At origination, the Company elected fair value treatment\nfor these loans as they were originally held-for-sale, to better reflect the economics of the transactions. In 2020, the Company decided to retain these loans on its\nbalance sheet as interest-earning assets and currently intends to continue doing so. Therefore, these loans are no longer accounted for as held-for-sale, but the\nCompany continues to present them at fair value. At September 30, 2024, such loans comprised $158.1 million of the $252.0 million of commercial loans, at\nfair value, with the balance comprised of the guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans also previously held for sale. The amortized cost of the $252.0 million\ncommercial loans at fair value was $255.7 million. Included in net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on commercial loans, at fair value in the consolidated\nstatements of operations are changes in the estimated fair value of such loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no related net\nunrealized losses or gains recognized for changes in fair value. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related net unrealized losses recognized for\nchanges in fair value were $1.7 million, $365,000 of which reflected losses attributable to credit weaknesses. In the third quarter of 2021, the Company resumed\nthe origination of non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans which it also intends to hold for investment\n14\nand which are accounted for at amortized cost. They are captioned as REBLs as they are transitional commercial mortgage loans which are made to improve\nand rehabilitate existing properties which already have cash flow.\nThe Bank has pledged the majority of its loans held for investment at amortized cost and commercial loans at fair value to either the FHLB or the Federal\nReserve Bank for lines of credit with those institutions. The FHLB and FRB lines are periodically utilized to manage liquidity. The amount of loans pledged\nvaries and the collateral may be unpledged at any time to the extent the collateral exceeds advances. The lines maintained are consistent with the Bank’s\nliquidity policy which maximizes potential liquidity. At September 30, 2024, $2.46 billion of loans were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank and $2.21 billion\nof loans were pledged to the FHLB against lines of credit which provide a source of liquidity to the Bank. There was $135.0 million drawn against the FHLB\nline at September 30, 2024.\nPrior to 2020, the Company sponsored the structuring of commercial mortgage loan securitizations, and in 2020, the Company decided not to pursue additional\nsecuritizations. The loans previously sold to the commercial mortgage-backed securitizations were transitional commercial mortgage loans made to improve\nand rehabilitate existing properties which already had cash flow. Servicing rights were not retained. Each of the securitizations is considered a variable interest\nentity of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Further, true sale accounting has been applicable to each of the securitizations, as supported by a\nreview performed by an independent third-party consultant. In each of the securitizations, the Company obtained a tranche of certificates which are accounted\nfor as available-for-sale debt securities. The securities were recorded at fair value at acquisition, which was determined by an independent third-party based on\nthe discounted cash flow method using unobservable (level 3) inputs.\nOf the six securities purchased by the Bank from our securitizations, all have been repaid except one issued by CRE-2, which is included in the commercial\nmortgage-backed securities classification in investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance of the Bank’s CRE-2-issued security was\n$12.6 million. As a result of the reduced excess of appraised value over the Bank’s principal and accruing interest based on new appraisals, the $12.6 million\nprincipal was placed in nonaccrual status and $1.3 million was reversed from securities interest in the second quarter of 2024. While the appraised values\nallocable to the Bank’s security exceed the principal and unpaid interest, there can be no assurance as to the amounts received upon the servicer’s disposition of\nthese properties, which will reflect additional servicing fees, actual disposition prices and other disposition costs.\nThe Company analyzes credit risk prior to making loans on an individual loan basis. The Company considers relevant aspects of the borrowers’ financial\nposition and cash flow, past borrower performance, management’s knowledge of market conditions, collateral and the ratio of loan amounts to estimated\ncollateral value in making its credit determinations. For SBLOC, the Company relies on the market value of the underlying securities collateral as adjusted by\nmargin requirements, generally 50% for equities and 80% for investment grade securities. For IBLOC, the Company relies on the cash value of insurance policy\ncollateral. Of the total $280.1 million of consumer fintech loans at September 30, 2024, $111.0 million consisted of secured credit card loans, with the balance\nconsisting of other short-term extensions of credit. Consumers do not pay interest on the majority of consumer fintech loan balances, including secured credit\ncard loans. The majority of the income on those loans is reflected in non-interest income under “Consumer credit fintech fees” and originate with the marketers\nand servicers for those loans. The secured credit card balances were collateralized with deposits at the Bank, with related income statement impact reflected\nboth in a lower cost of funds and fee income. The lower cost of funds results from balances required to be maintained to collateralize related card use. Related\nfee income is reflected in the “Consumer credit fintech fees” line of the income statement.\nMajor classifications of loans, excluding commercial loans at fair value, are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBL non-real estate $ 179,915 $ 137,752\nSBL commercial mortgage 665,608 606,986\nSBL construction 30,158 22,627\nSBLs 875,681 767,365\nDirect lease financing 711,836 685,657\nSBLOC / IBLOC(1) 1,543,215 1,627,285\nAdvisor financing(2) 248,422 221,612\nReal estate bridge loans 2,189,761 1,999,782\nConsumer fintech(3) 280,092 —\nOther loans(4) 46,586 50,638\n5,895,593 5,352,339\nUnamortized loan fees and costs 11,023 8,800\nTotal loans, including unamortized loan fees and costs $ 5,906,616 $ 5,361,139\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBLs, including costs net of deferred fees of $9,582 and $9,502\nfor September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively $ 885,263 $ 776,867\n15\nSBLs included in commercial loans, at fair value 93,888 119,287\nTotal SBLs(5) $ 979,151 $ 896,154\n(1) SBLOC are collateralized by marketable securities, while IBLOC are collateralized by the cash surrender value of insurance policies. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, IBLOC loans\namounted to $554.0 million and $646.9 million, respectively.\n(2) In 2020, the Bank began originating loans to investment advisors for purposes of debt refinancing, acquisition of another firm or internal succession. Maximum loan amounts are subject to loan-to-\nvalue ratios of 70% of the business enterprise value based on a third-party valuation but may be increased depending upon the debt service coverage ratio. Personal guarantees and blanket business\nliens are obtained as appropriate.\n(3) Consumer fintech loans included $111.0 million of secured credit card loans, with the balance consisting of other short-term extensions of credit.\n(4) Includes demand deposit overdrafts reclassified as loan balances totaling $960,000 and $1.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Estimated overdraft charge-offs\nand recoveries are reflected in the ACL and are immaterial.\n(5) The SBLs held at fair value are comprised of the government guaranteed portion of 7(a) Program (as defined below) loans at the dates indicated.\nThe loan review department recommends non-accrual status for loans to the surveillance committee, in those situations where interest income appears to be\nuncollectible or a protracted delay in collection becomes evident. The surveillance committee further vets and approves the non-accrual status.\nThe following table summarizes non-accrual loans with and without an ACL as of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nSep tem be r 30, 2024 D ecember 31, 2023\nNon-accrual loans with a Non-accrual loans\nrelated ACL Related ACL without a related ACL Total non-accrual loans Total non-accrual loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 2,236 $ 524 $ 811 $ 3,047 $ 1,842\nSBL commercial mortgage 1,814 931 3,084 4,898 2,381\nSBL construction 1,585 118 — 1,585 3,385\nDirect leasing 3,211 1,867 708 3,919 3,785\nReal estate bridge loans — — 12,300 12,300 —\nOther loans — — — — 132\n$ 8,846 $ 3,440 $ 16,903 $ 25,749 $ 11,525\nThe Company had $61.7 million of other real estate owned (“OREO”) at September 30, 2024, and $16.9 million of OREO at December 31, 2023.

On April 2, 2024, the same loan was transferred from nonaccrual status\nto OREO, and comprised the majority of our OREO at September 30, 2024, with a balance at that date of $40.3 million. We intend to continue to manage the capital improvements on the underlying\napartment complex. As the units become available for lease, the property manager will be tasked with leasing these units at market rents. The $40.3 million balance compares to a September 2023\nthird party “as is” appraisal of $47.8 million, or an 84% “as is” loan to value (“LTV”), with additional potential collateral value as construction progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental\nrates. The Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for that apartment property acquired by the Bank through foreclosure. The purchaser has made earnest money deposits of $375,000,\nwith additional required deposits projected to total $500,000 prior to the December 31, 2024 closing deadline. The sales price is expected to cover the Company’s current OREO balance plus the\nforecasted cost of improvements to the property. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, earnest money deposits are expected to\naccrue to the Company. The nonaccrual balances in this table as of September 30, 2024, are also reflected in the substandard loan totals.\nInterest which would have been earned on loans classified as non-accrual for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $886,000 and\n$621,000, respectively. No income on non-accrual loans was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, $1.0 million of REBL, $69,000 of direct leasing, $130,000 of SBL commercial real estate, and $33,000 of SBL non-real estate were\nreversed from interest income, which represented interest accrued on loans placed into non-accrual status during the period. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, $89,000 of legacy commercial real estate,\n16\n$89,000 of SBL commercial real estate, $10,000 of SBL non-real estate, $13,000 of IBLOC, and $71,000 of direct leasing were reversed from interest income,\nwhich represented interest accrued on loans placed into non-accrual status during the period. Material amounts of prior year non-accrual interest reversals are\ncharged to the ACL, but such amounts were not material during either the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. In the third quarter of 2024\n$815,000 of interest was reversed from interest income as a result of REBL loan modifications.\nLoans which are experiencing financial stress are reviewed by the loan review department, which is independent of the lending lines. The review includes an\nanalysis for a potential specific reserve allocation in the ACL. For REBLs, updated appraisals are generally obtained in conjunction with modifications.\nDuring the three month and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, loans modified and related information are as follows\n(dollars in thousands):\nThree mo nt hs ended Septembe r 3 0, 2024 Three m on ths ended Septembe r 3 0, 2023\nPayment delay as Interest rate Payment delay as\na result of a reduction and Percent of total a result of a Percent of total\npayment deferral payment deferral Term extension Total loan category payment deferral Total loan category\nSBL non-real estate $ 819 $ — $ — $ 819 0.46% $ — $ — —\nSBL commercial mortgage — — — — — — — —\nDirect lease financing — — — — — — — —\nReal estate bridge loans — 55,336 — 55,336 2.53% — — —\nTotal $ 819 $ 55,336 $ — $ 56,155 0.95% $ — $ — —\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 Nine months ended September 30, 2023\nPayment delay as Interest rate Payment delay as\na result of a reduction and Percent of total a result of a Percent of total\npayment deferral payment deferral Term extension Total loan category payment deferral Total loan category\nSBL non-real estate $ 2,484 $ — $ — $ 2,484 1.38% $ 156 $ 156 0.12%\nSBL commercial mortgage 3,271 — — 3,271 0.49% — — —\nDirect lease financing — — 2,521 2,521 0.35% — — —\nReal estate bridge loans(1) — 87,836 — 87,836 4.01% — — —\nTotal $ 5,755 $ 87,836 $ 2,521 $ 96,112 1.63% $ 156 $ 156 —\n(1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the “as is” weighted average LTV of the real estate bridge lending balances was approximately 73%, and the “as stabilized” LTV was approximately\n66% based upon appraisals performed within the past twelve months. “As stabilized” LTVs reflect the third-party appraiser’s estimated value after the rehabilitation is complete and units are released\nat stabilized rates.

The balances for both periods were also classified as either special mention or\nsubstandard as of September 30, 2024.\n(2) Percentage represents the principal of loans deferred divided by the principal of the total loan portfolio.\nWhile borrowers for a $12.3 million apartment property loan which had a six month payment deferral granted in the fourth quarter of 2023 have not resumed\npayments, the related “as is” and “as stabilized” LTV based on a May 2024 appraisal were 72% and 56%, respectively. That balance comprises the balance of\nREBL nonaccrual loans as of September 30, 2024. The “as stabilized” LTV measures the apartment property’s value after renovations have been completed and\nunits have generally been re-leased.\nThere were no loans that received a term extension modification which had a payment default during the period and were modified in the twelve months before\ndefault.\n18\nThe Company had no commitments to extend additional credit to loans classified as modified for the periods ended September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nOf the $84.4 million special mention and $155.4 million substandard REBL loans at September 30, 2024, $55.3 million were modified in the third quarter of\n2024 and received reductions in interest rates and payment deferrals. Included in the $155.4 million was $26.9 million which had been modified in first quarter\n2024 with a six month payment deferral. The third quarter additional modification was for an additional three month payment deferral and a partial nine month\npayment deferral.\nNot included in the $55.3 million of REBL loans were (i) $19.3 million which was recapitalized with a new borrower, who negotiated a partial interest deferral\nand rate reduction, and (ii) $37.3 million which is accounted for at fair value, and as such, not reflected in modification totals. While payment deferrals have\ngenerally been for three to twelve months, that loan was granted a 15 month payment deferral, followed by a nine month partial payment deferral, in addition to\nan interest rate reduction. Going forward, the Company will not be accruing interest on this loan. The weighted average “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs for the\n$19.3 million balance were 72% and 68%, respectively, while those LTVs for the $37.3 million were 73% and 65%, respectively.\nThere were $56.2 million and $96.1 million of total loans classified as modified for the three month and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, with specific reserves of zero and $5,000, for the three month and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. There were zero\nand $156,000 of loans classified as modified for the three month and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2023. Substantially all of the reserves at\nSeptember 30, 2024 related to the non-guaranteed portion of SBA loans.\nManagement estimates the ACL quarterly and for most loan categories uses relevant available internal and external historical loan performance information to\ndetermine the quantitative component of the reserve and current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and other factors to determine\nthe qualitative component of the reserve. Reserves on specific credit-deteriorated loans comprise the third and final component of the reserve. Historical credit\nloss experience provides the quantitative basis for the estimation of expected credit losses over the estimated remaining life of the loans. The qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL is designed to be responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and the impact of current and future economic conditions on loan\nperformance, and is subjective. The review of the appropriateness of the ACL is performed by the Chief Credit Officer and presented to the Audit Committee of\nthe Company’s Board of Directors for review. With the exception of SBLOC and IBLOC, which utilize probability of default/loss given default, and the other\nloan category, which uses discounted cash flow to determine a reserve, the quantitative components for remaining categories are determined by establishing\nreserves on loan pools with similar risk characteristics based on a lifetime loss-rate model, or vintage analysis, as described in the following paragraph. Loans\nthat do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. If foreclosure is believed to be probable or repayment is expected from the sale of\ncollateral, a reserve for deficiency is established within the ACL. Those reserves are estimated based on the difference between loan principal and the estimated\nfair value of the collateral, adjusted for estimated disposition costs.\nBelow are the portfolio segments used to pool loans with similar risk characteristics and align with the Company’s methodology for measuring expected credit\nlosses. These pools have similar risk and collateral characteristics, and certain of these pools are broken down further in determining and applying the vintage\nloss estimates previously discussed. For instance, within the direct lease financing pool, government and public institution leases are considered separately.\nAdditionally, the Company evaluates its loans under an internal loan risk rating system as a means of identifying problem loans. The special mention\nclassification indicates weaknesses that may, if not cured, threaten the borrower’s future repayment ability. A substandard classification reflects an existing\nweakness indicating the possible inadequacy of net worth and other repayment sources. These classifications are used both by regulators and peers, as they have\nbeen correlated with an increased probability of credit losses.

These loans are classified as SBL in the Company’s loan table, which classifies loans\nby type, as opposed to risk characteristics.\nSBL. Substantially all SBLs consist of SBA loans. The Bank participates in loan programs established by the SBA, including the 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program\n(the “7(a) Program”), the 504 Fixed Asset Financing Program (the “504 Program”), and the discontinued PPP. The 7(a) Program is designed to help small\nbusiness borrowers start or expand their businesses by providing partial guarantees of loans made by banks and non-bank lending institutions for specific\nbusiness purposes, including long or short-term working capital; funds for the purchase of equipment, machinery, supplies and materials; funds for the\npurchase, construction or renovation of real estate; and\n21\nfunds to acquire, operate or expand an existing business or refinance existing debt, all under conditions established by the SBA. The 504 Program includes the\nfinancing of real estate and commercial mortgages. In 2020 and 2021, the Company also participated in the PPP, which provided short-term loans to small\nbusinesses. PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. This program was a specific response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the vast majority of\nthese loans have been reimbursed by the U.S. government, with $1.6 million remaining to be reimbursed as of September 30, 2024. The Company segments the\nSBL portfolio into four pools: non-real estate, commercial mortgage and construction to capture the risk characteristics of each pool, and the PPP loans\ndiscussed above. PPP loans are not included in the risk pools because they have inherently different risk characteristics due to the U.S. government guarantee.\nIn the table above, the PPP loans are included in non-rated SBL non-real estate. The qualitative factors for SBL loans focus on pool loan performance,\nunderlying collateral for collateral dependent loans and changes in economic conditions. Additionally, the construction segment adds a qualitative factor for\ngeneral construction risk, such as construction delays resulting from labor shortages or availability/pricing of construction materials.\nDirect lease financing. The Company provides lease financing for commercial and government vehicle fleets and, to a lesser extent, provides lease financing for\nother equipment. Leases are either open-end or closed-end. An open-end lease is one in which, at the end of the lease term, the lessee must pay the difference\nbetween the amount at which the Company sells the leased asset and the stated termination value. Termination value is a contractual value agreed to by the\nparties at the inception of a lease as to the value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term. A closed-end lease is one for which no such payment is due on\nlease termination. In a closed-end lease, the risk that the amount received on a sale of the leased asset will be less than the residual value is assumed by the\nBank, as lessor. The qualitative factors for direct lease financing focus on underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, portfolio loan performance, loan\nconcentrations and changes in economic conditions.\nSBLOC. SBLOC loans are made to individuals, trusts and entities and are secured by a pledge of marketable securities maintained in one or more accounts for\nwhich the Company obtains a securities account control agreement. The securities pledged may be either debt or equity securities or a combination thereof, but\nall such securities must be listed for trading on a national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. SBLOCs are typically payable on\ndemand. Maximum SBLOC line amounts are calculated by applying a standard “advance rate” calculation against the eligible security type depending on asset\nclass: typically, up to 50% for equity securities and mutual fund securities and 80% for investment grade (Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB- or higher, or\nMoody’s rating of Baa3 or higher) municipal or corporate debt securities. Substantially all SBLOCs have full recourse to the borrower. The underlying\nsecurities collateral for SBLOC loans is monitored on a daily basis to confirm the composition of the client portfolio and its daily market value. The primary\nqualitative factor in the SBLOC analysis is the ratio of loans outstanding to market value. This factor has been maintained at low levels, which has remained\nappropriate as losses have not materialized despite the historic declines in the equity markets during 2020, during which there were no losses. Significant losses\nhave not been incurred since inception of this line of business. Additionally, the advance rates noted above were established to provide the Company with\nprotection from declines in market conditions from the origination date of the lines of credit.\nIBLOC. IBLOC loans are collateralized by the cash surrender value of eligible insurance policies. Should a loan default, the primary risks for IBLOCs are if\nthe insurance company issuing the policy were to become insolvent, or if that company would fail to recognize the Bank’s assignment of policy proceeds. To\nmitigate these risks, insurance company ratings are periodically evaluated for compliance with Bank standards. Additionally, the Bank utilizes assignments of\ncash surrender value, which legal counsel has concluded are enforceable. Significant losses have not been incurred since inception of this line of business. The\nqualitative factors for IBLOC primarily focus on the concentration risk with insurance companies.\nInvestment advisor financing. In 2020, the Bank began originating loans to investment advisors for purposes of debt refinancing, acquisition of another firm or\ninternal succession. Maximum loan amounts are subject to loan-to-value ratios of 70%, based on third-party business appraisals, but may be increased\ndepending upon the debt service coverage ratio. Personal guarantees and blanket business liens are obtained as appropriate. Loan repayment is highly dependent\non fee streams from advisor clientele. Accordingly, loss of fee-based investment advisory clients or negative market performance may reduce fees and pose a\nrisk to these credits. As credit losses have not been experienced, the ACL is determined by qualitative factors. The qualitative factors for investment advisor\nfinancing focus on historical industry losses, changes in lending policies and procedures, portfolio performance and economic conditions.\nReal estate bridge loans. Real estate bridge loans are transitional commercial mortgage loans which are made to improve and rehabilitate existing properties\nwhich already have cash flow, and which are securitized by those properties. Prior to 2020, such loans were originated for securitization and loans which had\nbeen originated but not securitized continue to be accounted for at fair value in “Commercial loans, at fair value”, on the balance sheet. In 2021, originations\nresumed and are being held for investment in “Loans, net of deferred fees and costs”, on the balance sheet. The Bancorp has minimal exposure to non-\nmultifamily commercial real estate such as office buildings, and instead has a portfolio largely comprised of rehabilitation bridge loans for apartment buildings.\nThese loans generally have three-year terms with two one-year extensions to allow for the rehabilitation work to be completed and rentals stabilized for an\nextended period, before being refinanced at lower rates through U.S. Government Sponsored Entities or other lenders. The rehabilitation real estate lending\nportfolio consists primarily of workforce housing, which the Company considers to be working class apartments at\n22\nmore affordable rental rates. As charge-offs have generally not been experienced for multifamily (apartment building loans) which comprise the REBL\nportfolio, the ACL is determined by qualitative factors. Qualitative factors focus on historical industry losses, changes in classified loan balances, changes in\neconomic conditions and underlying collateral and portfolio performance. In the third quarter of 2024, as a result of increased levels of loans classified as\nspecial mention or substandard, a new qualitative factor related to the level of such classified loans was added.\nConsumer fintech loans. Consumer fintech loans consist of short-term extensions of credit including secured credit card loans made in conjunction with\nmarketers and servicers. The majority of secured credit card balances are collateralized with deposits at the Bank, with related income statement impact\nreflected both in a lower cost of funds and fee income. The lower cost of funds results from balances required to be maintained to collateralize related card use.\nFee income for consumer fintech loans is reflected in the “Consumer credit fintech fees” line of the income statement.\nOther loans. Other loans include commercial and home equity lines of credit which the Company generally no longer offers. Qualitative factors focus on\nchanges in the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, portfolio loan performance, loan concentrations and changes in economic conditions.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the estimated remaining lives of loans. The estimate excludes possible extensions, renewals and modifications unless\neither of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation that a loan will be restructured, or the extension or renewal options are included in the\nborrower contract and are not unconditionally cancellable by us.\nThe Company does not measure an ACL on accrued interest receivable balances, because these balances are written off in a timely manner as a reduction to\ninterest income when loans are placed on non-accrual status.\nACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to\ncredit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The ACL on such off-balance\nsheet credit exposures, also referred to as loan commitments, is adjusted through the provision for credit losses. The estimate considers the likelihood that\nfunding will occur over the estimated life of the commitment. The amount of the ACL on such exposures as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31,\n2023 was $2.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively.\nA detail of the changes in the ACL by loan category and summary of loans evaluated individually and collectively for credit deterioration is as follows (in\nthousands):\n23\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor

In the first nine months of 2024,\nthe Company purchased $35.9 million of SBLs, none of which were credit deteriorated. Additionally, in the first nine months of 2024, the Company participated\nin SBLs with other institutions in the amount of $7.5 million.\nThe non-accrual loans in the following table are treated as collateral dependent to the extent they have resulted from borrower financial difficulty (and not from\nadministrative delays or other mitigating factors), and are not brought current. For non-accrual loans, the Company establishes a reserve in the allowance for\ncredit losses for deficiencies between estimated collateral and loan carrying values. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not\nhave any significant changes to the extent to which collateral secures its collateral dependent loans due to general collateral deterioration or from other factors.\nSBL non-real estate are collateralized by business assets, which may include certain real estate. SBL commercial mortgage and construction are collateralized\nby real estate for small businesses, while real estate bridge lending is primarily collateralized by apartment buildings, or other commercial real estate. SBLOC is\ncollateralized by marketable investment securities while IBLOC is collateralized by the cash value of life insurance. Advisor financing is collateralized by\ninvestment advisors’ business franchises. Direct lease financing is collateralized primarily by vehicles or equipment.\n27\nA detail of the Company’s delinquent loans by loan category is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\n30-59 days 60-89 days 90+ days Total past due Total\npast due past due still accruing Non-accrual and non-accrual Current loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 72 $ 322 $ 758 $ 3,047 $ 4,199 $ 175,716 $ 179,915\nSBL commercial mortgage — — 336 4,898 5,234 660,374 665,608\nSBL construction — — — 1,585 1,585 28,573 30,158\nDirect lease financing 5,791 12,883 1,260 3,919 23,853 687,983 711,836\nSBLOC / IBLOC 10,251 2,014 2,383 — 14,648 1,528,567 1,543,215\nAdvisor financing — — — — — 248,422 248,422\nReal estate bridge loans(1) — — — 12,300 12,300 2,177,461 2,189,761\nConsumer fintech 4,021 4 — — 4,025 276,067 280,092\nOther loans — — — — — 46,586 46,586\nUnamortized loan fees and costs — — — — — 11,023 11,023\n$ 20,135 $ 15,223 $ 4,737 $ 25,749 $ 65,844 $ 5,840,772 $ 5,906,616\nDecember 31, 2023\n30-59 days 60-89 days 90+ days Total past due Total\npast due past due still accruing Non-accrual and non-accrual Current loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 84 $ 333 $ 336 $ 1,842 $ 2,595 $ 135,157 $ 137,752\nSBL commercial mortgage 2,183 — — 2,381 4,564 602,422 606,986\nSBL construction — — — 3,385 3,385 19,242 22,627\nDirect lease financing 5,163 1,209 485 3,785 10,642 675,015 685,657\nSBLOC / IBLOC 21,934 3,607 745 — 26,286 1,600,999 1,627,285\nAdvisor financing — — — — — 221,612 221,612\nReal estate bridge loans — — — — — 1,999,782 1,999,782\nConsumer fintech — — — — — — —\nOther loans 853 76 178 132 1,239 49,399 50,638\nUnamortized loan fees and costs — — — — — 8,800 8,800\n$ 30,217 $ 5,225 $ 1,744 $ 11,525 $ 48,711 $ 5,312,428 $ 5,361,139\n(1) The $12.3 million shown in the non-accrual column for real estate bridge loans is collateralized by apartment building property with respective 72% and 56% “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs,\nrespectively, based upon a May 2024 appraisal. “As stabilized” LTVs represent additional potential collateral value as rehabilitation progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental rates. The\ntable above does not include an $11.2 million loan accounted for at fair value, and, as such, not reflected in delinquency tables. In third quarter 2024, the borrower notified the Company that he would\nno longer be making payments on the loan, which is collateralized by a vacant retail property. Based upon a July 2024 appraisal, the “as is” LTV is 84% and the “as stabilized” LTV is 62%.

Transactions with Affiliates\nThe Bank did not maintain any deposits for various affiliated companies as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Bank has entered into lending transactions in the ordinary course of business with directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliates of such\npersons. All loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with\npersons not related to the lender. At September 30, 2024, these loans were current as to principal and interest payments and did not involve more than normal\nrisk of collectability. Loans to these related parties amounted to $5.2 million at September 30, 2024 and $5.7 million at December 31, 2023.\n28\nMr. Hersh Kozlov, a director of the Company, is a partner at Duane Morris LLP, an international law firm. The Company paid Duane Morris LLP $4,800 and\n$164,000 for legal services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNote 8. Fair Value Measurements\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of an entity’s assets and liabilities considered to be financial instruments. For\nthe Company, as for most financial institutions, the majority of its assets and liabilities are considered to be financial instruments. However, many such\ninstruments lack an available trading market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange transaction. Accordingly, estimated\nfair values are determined by the Company using the best available data and an estimation methodology it believes to be suitable for each category of financial\ninstruments. Also, it is the Company’s general practice and intent to hold its financial instruments to maturity whether or not categorized as available-for-sale\nand not to engage in trading or sales activities although it has sold loans and securities in the past and may do so in the future. For fair value disclosure\npurposes, the Company utilized certain value measurement criteria required in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC\n820”), as discussed below. In addition, ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to assets and liabilities. It clarifies that fair value is\nan exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants\nat the measurement date. It also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures concerning fair value measurements. ASC 820\nestablishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3\nmeasurements). Level 1 valuation is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities to which the Company has access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 valuation is based on other observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. This includes quoted prices for similar assets in active\nor inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks,\ndefault rates, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated through, observable market data by market-corroborated reports. Level 3 valuation is\nbased on “unobservable inputs” which the Company believes is the best information available in the circumstances. A financial instrument’s level within the fair\nvalue hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nChanges in the assumptions or methodologies used to estimate fair values may materially affect the estimated amounts. Also, there may not be reasonable\ncomparability between institutions due to the wide range of permitted assumptions and methodologies in the absence of active markets. This lack of uniformity\ngives rise to a high degree of subjectivity in estimating financial instrument fair values.\nCash and cash equivalents, which are comprised of cash and due from banks and the Company’s balance at the Federal Reserve Bank, had recorded values of\n$55.8 million and $1.04 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which approximated fair values.\nThe estimated Level 2 fair values of investment securities are based on quoted market prices, if available, or estimated independently by a third-party pricing\nservice based upon their matrix pricing technique. Level 3 investment security fair values are based on the present valuing of cash flows, which discounts\nexpected cash flows from principal and interest using yield to maturity, or yield to call as appropriate, at the measurement date. In the third quarter of 2024 and\n2023, there were no transfers between the three levels.\nFederal Reserve, FHLB, and ACBB stock, are held as required by those respective institutions and are carried at cost. Each of these institutions require their\nmembers to hold stock as a condition of membership. While a fixed stock amount is required by each of these institutions, the FHLB stock requirement\nperiodically increases or decreases with varying levels of borrowing activity.\nCommercial loans held at fair value are comprised primarily of commercial real estate bridge loans and SBA loans which had been originated for sale or\nsecuritization in the secondary market, and which are now being held on the balance sheet. Commercial real estate bridge loans and SBA loans are valued using\na discounted cash flow analysis based upon pricing for similar loans where market indications of the sales price of such loans are not available. SBA loans are\nvalued on a pooled basis and commercial real estate bridge loans are valued individually.\nLoans, net have an estimated fair value using the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate used in these calculations is the estimated current market\nrate adjusted for credit risk. Accrued interest receivable has a carrying value that approximates fair value.\nLoan fair values are based on “unobservable inputs” that are based on available information. Level 3 fair values are based on the present value of cash flows by\nunit of measurement.\nFor OREO, market value is based upon appraisals of the underlying collateral by third-party appraisers, reduced by 7% to 10% for estimated selling costs.\nThe estimated fair values of demand deposits (comprised of interest and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and certain types of money\nmarket accounts) are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (generally, their carrying\n29\namounts). The fair values of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term borrowings, when outstanding, are equal to their carrying amounts as\nthey are short-term borrowings.\nTime deposits, when outstanding, senior debt and subordinated debentures have a fair value estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies\ncurrent interest rates to discount expected cash flows. The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value. Long term borrowings\nresulting from sold loans which did not qualify for true sale accounting are presented in the amount of the principal of such loans.\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps, recorded in other assets or other liabilities, are determined using models that use readily observable market inputs and a\nmarket standard methodology applied to the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and interest rate indices.\nThe fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated based on the amount of unamortized deferred loan commitment fees. The fair value of letters of\ncredit is based on the amount of unearned fees plus the estimated cost to terminate the letters of credit. Fair values of unrecognized financial instruments,\nincluding commitments to extend credit, and the fair value of letters of credit are considered immaterial.\nThe following tables provide information

subject to judgments, assumptions and uncertainties, changes in which could\nhave a significant impact on such valuations. Weighted averages were calculated by using the discount rate for each individual security or loan weighted by its\nmarket value, except for SBA loans. For SBA loans, the yield derived from market pricing indications for comparable pools determined by date of loan\norigination. For commercial loans recorded at fair value, changes in fair value are reflected in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of securities\nwhich are unrelated to credit are recorded through equity. Changes in the fair value of loans recorded at amortized cost which are unrelated to credit are a\ndisclosure item, without impact on the financial statements. The notes below refer to the September 30, 2024 table.\n(1) Commercial mortgage-backed investment security, consisting of a single bank-issued CRE security, is valued using discounted cash flow analysis. The\ndiscount rate and prepayment rate applied are based upon market observations and actual experience for comparable securities and implicitly assume market\naverages for defaults and loss severities. The CRE-2 security has significant credit enhancement, or protection from other subordinated tranches in the issue,\nwhich limits the valuation exposure to credit losses. Nonetheless, increases in expected default rates or loss severities on the loans underlying the issue could\nreduce its value. In market environments in which investors demand greater yield compensation for credit risk, the discount rate applied would ordinarily be\nhigher and the valuation lower. Changes in loss experience could also change the interest earned on this holding in future periods and impact its fair value. As a\nsingle security, the weighted average rate shown is the actual rate applied to the CRE-2 security. For additional information related to this security, which was\ntransferred to nonaccrual status in the third quarter of 2024, see “Note 6. Loans.”\n32\n(2) Commercial – SBA Loans are comprised of the government guaranteed portion of SBA-insured loans. Their valuation is based upon the yield derived from\ndealer pricing indications for guaranteed pools, adjusted for seasoning and prepayments. A limited number of broker-dealers originate the pooled securities for\nwhich the loans are purchased and as a result, prices can fluctuate based on such limited market demand, although the government guarantee has resulted in\nconsistent historical demand. Valuations are impacted by prepayment assumptions resulting from both voluntary payoffs and defaults. Such assumptions for\nthese seasoned loans are based on a seasoning vector for constant prepayment rates from 3% to 30% over life.\n(3) Non-SBA commercial real estate – fixed are fixed rate non-SBA commercial real estate mortgages. These loans are fair valued by a third-party, based upon\ndiscounting at market rates for similar loans. Discount rates used in applying discounted cash flow analysis utilize input based upon loan terms, the general\nlevel of interest rates and the quality of the credit. Deterioration in loan performance or other credit weaknesses could result in fair value ranges which would be\ndependent upon potential buyers’ tolerance for such weaknesses and are difficult to estimate.\n(4) Non-SBA commercial real estate – floating are floating rate non-SBA loans, the majority of which are secured by multifamily properties (apartments). These\nare bridge loans designed to provide owners time and funding for property improvements and are generally valued using discounted cash flow analysis. The\ndiscount rate for the vast majority of these loans was based upon current origination rates for similar loans. Deterioration in loan performance or other credit\nweaknesses could result in fair value ranges which would be dependent upon potential buyers’ tolerance for such weaknesses and are difficult to estimate. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, these loans were fair valued by a third-party, based upon discounting at market rates for similar loans.\n(5) For OREO, fair value is based upon appraisals of the underlying collateral by third-party appraisers, reduced by 7% to 10% for estimated selling costs. Such\nappraisals reflect estimates of amounts realizable upon property sales based on the sale of comparable properties and other factors. Actual sales prices may vary\nbased upon the identification of potential purchasers, changing conditions in local real estate markets and the level of interest rates required to finance\npurchases.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, segregated by fair value hierarchy, during the periods shown are summarized below (dollars in\nthousands). The non-accrual loans in the following table are treated as collateral dependent to the extent they have resulted from borrower financial difficulty\n(and not from administrative delays or other mitigating factors), and are not brought current. For non-accrual loans, the Company establishes a reserve in the\nallowance for credit losses for deficiencies between estimated collateral and loan carrying values.\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted prices in active Significant other Significant\nmarkets for identical observable unobservable\nFair value assets inputs inputs(1)\nDescription September 30, 2024 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCollateral dependent loans with specific reserves(1) $ 5,410 $ — $ — $ 5,410\nOREO 61,739 — — 61,739\n$ 67,149 $ — $ — $ 67,149\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted prices in active Significant other Significant\nmarkets for identical observable unobservable\nFair value assets inputs inputs(1)\nDescription December 31, 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCollateral dependent loans with specific reserves(1) $ 8,944 $ — $ — $ 8,944\nOREO 16,949 — — 16,949\n$ 25,893 $ — $ — $ 25,893\n(1) The method of valuation approach for the loans evaluated for an allowance for credit losses on an individual loan basis and also for OREO was the market approach based upon appraisals of the\nunderlying collateral by external appraisers, reduced by 7% to 10% for estimated selling costs.\nAt September 30, 2024, principal on collateral dependent loans, which is accounted for on the basis of the value of underlying collateral, is shown at an\nestimated fair value of $5.4 million. To arrive at that fair value, related loan principal of $8.9 million was reduced by specific reserves of $3.5 million within the\nACL as of that date, representing the deficiency between principal and estimated collateral values, which were reduced by estimated costs to sell. When the\ndeficiency is deemed uncollectible, it is charged off by reducing the specific reserve and decreasing principal. Valuation techniques consistent with the market\nand/or cost approach were used to measure fair value and primarily included observable inputs for the individual loans being evaluated such as recent sales of\nsimilar collateral or observable market data for operational or carrying costs. In cases where such inputs were unobservable, the loan balance is reflected within\nthe Level 3 hierarchy.\n33\nNote 9. Other Identifiable Intangible Assets\nIn May 2016, the Company purchased approximately $60.0 million of lease receivables which resulted in a customer list intangible of $3.4 million that is being\namortized over a ten-year period. Amortization expense is $340,000 per year ($539,000 over the next three years). The gross carrying amount of the customer\nlist intangible is $3.4 million, and as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, the accumulated amortization expense was $2.9 million and\n$2.6 million.\nIn January 2020, the Company purchased McMahon Leasing and subsidiaries for approximately $8.7 million which resulted in $1.1 million of intangibles. The\ngross carrying value of $1.1 million of intangibles was comprised of a customer list intangible of $689,000, goodwill of $263,000 and a trade name valuation of\n$135,000. The customer list intangible is being amortized over a twelve year period and accumulated amortization expense was $273,000 at September 30,\n2024 and $230,000 at December 31, 2023. Amortization expense is $57,000 per year ($287,000 over the next five years). The gross carrying value and\naccumulated amortization related to the Company’s intangibles at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented below:\nSept emb er 30, Dece mb er 3 1,\n2024 2023\nGross Gross\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying Accumulated\nAmount Amortization Amount Amortization\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCustomer list intangibles $ 4,093 $ 3,138 $ 4,093 $ 2,840\nGoodwill 263 — 263 —\nTrade Name 135 — 135 —\nTotal $ 4,491 $ 3,138 $ 4,491 $ 2,840\nNote 10. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\nASU 2023-07 enhances segment level disclosures, for both annual and quarterly reporting periods and is effective with the December 31, 2024 financial\nstatements. As a result of the enhancements, segment disclosures will include greater detail surrounding the nature of expenses now reported as a single line\nitem in the segment income statements. In addition to disclosing the chief operational decision maker by title and position, an explanation of how the segment\ninformation is used by that decision maker will be summarized.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09, effective January 1,\n2025, adds annual disclosures for the amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, shown separately for federal, state and foreign taxes. Total tax paid, net of\nrefunds, for any jurisdictions which exceed 5% of total net taxes paid, will also be shown separately. The Company is currently evaluating these disclosures.\nNote 11. Shareholders’ Equity\nOn October 20, 2021, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2022 fiscal year (the “2022 Repurchase\nProgram”). Under the 2022 Repurchase Program, the Company repurchased $15.0 million in value of the Company’s common stock in each quarter of 2022.\nOn October 26, 2022, the Board approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2023 fiscal year (the “2023 Repurchase Program”). Under the 2023\nRepurchase Program, the Company repurchased $25.0 million in value of the Company’s common stock in each quarter of 2023.\nOn October 26, 2023, the Board approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2024 fiscal year (the “2024 Repurchase Program”), which authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase $50.0 million in value of the Company’s common stock per fiscal quarter in 2024, for a maximum amount of $200.0 million. The\nCompany increased its share repurchase authorization for the second quarter of 2024 from $50.0 million to $100.0 million, which increased the maximum\namount under the 2024 Repurchase Program to $250.0 million. Under the 2024 Repurchase Program, the Company intends to repurchase shares through open\nmarket purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The 2024 Repurchase Program may be modified or terminated at any time. During\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1,037,069 shares and 5,317,686 shares of its common stock in the open market\nunder the 2024 Repurchase Program at an average price of $48.22 per share and $37.61 per share, respectively.\nAs a means of returning capital to shareholders, the Company implemented stock repurchase programs which totaled $40.0 million, $60.0 million and $100.0\nmillion, in equal quarterly amounts, respectively, in 2021, 2022 and 2023, with $200 million originally planned for 2024. Subsequently the second quarter 2024\nplanned repurchase was increased from $50 million to $100 million, with $50 million\n34\nin repurchases planned for each remaining quarter of 2024. The planned amounts of such repurchases are generally determined in the fourth quarter of the\npreceding year by assessing the impact of budgetary earnings projections on regulatory capital requirements. The excess of projected earnings over amounts\nrequired to maintain capital requirements is the maximum available for capital return to shareholders, barring any need to retain capital for other purposes. A\nsignificant portion of such excess earnings has been utilized for stock repurchases in the amounts noted above, while cash dividends have not been paid. In\ndetermining whether capital is returned through stock repurchases or cash dividends, the Company calculates a maximum share repurchase price, based upon\ncomparisons with what it concludes to be other exemplar peer share price valuations, with further consideration of internal growth projections. As these share\nprices, which are updated at least annually, have not been reached, capital return has consisted solely of stock repurchases. Exemplar share price comparisons\nare based upon multiples of earnings per share over time, with further consideration of returns on equity and assets. While repurchase amounts are planned in\nthe fourth quarter of the preceding year, repurchases may be modified or terminated at any time, should capital need to be conserved.\nNote 12. Regulatory Matters\nIt is the policy of the Federal Reserve that financial holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past\nyear and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that a\nfinancial holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the financial holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength\nto its banking subsidiaries.\nVarious federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory\napproval. Without the prior approval of the OCC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of\nthe current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Additionally, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s\nretained earnings. Moreover, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than “adequately capitalized”\nunder the prompt corrective action framework as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment\ndue to the FDIC. Similarly, a banking organization that fails to satisfy regulatory minimum capital conservation buffer requirements will be subject to certain\nlimitations, which include restrictions on capital distributions.\nIn addition to these explicit limitations, federal and state regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or financial holding company from\nengaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an\nunsafe or unsound banking practice.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum\ncapital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material\neffect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the\nCompany and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as\ncalculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification of the Company and the Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments\nby the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Moreover, capital requirements may be modified based upon regulatory rules or by\nregulatory discretion at any time reflecting a variety of factors including deterioration in asset quality.\nThe following table sets forth our regulatory capital amounts and ratios for the periods indicated:\nTier 1 capital Tier 1 capital Total capital Common equity\nto average to risk-weighted to risk-weighted tier 1 to risk\nassets ratio assets ratio assets ratio weighted assets\nAs of September 30, 2024\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 9.86% 13.62% 14.19% 13.62%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 10.94% 15.11% 15.67% 15.11%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\nAs of December 31, 2023\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 11.19% 15.66% 16.23% 15.66%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 12.37% 17.35% 17.92% 17.35%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\nNote 13. Legal\nOn June 12, 2019, the Bank was served with a qui tam lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, New Castle County. The Delaware\nDepartment of Justice intervened in the litigation. The case is titled The State of Delaware, Plaintiff, Ex rel. Russell S. Rogers, Plaintiff-Relator v. The Bancorp\nBank, Interactive Communications International, Inc., and InComm Financial Services, Inc., Defendants. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants violated the\nDelaware False Claims Act by not paying balances on certain open-\n35\nloop “Vanilla” prepaid cards to the State of Delaware as unclaimed property. The complaint seeks actual and treble damages, statutory penalties, and attorneys’\nfees. The Bank has filed an answer denying the allegations and continues to vigorously defend against the claims. The Bank and other defendants previously\nfiled a motion to dismiss the action, but the motion was denied and the case is in preliminary stages of discovery. The Company is unable to determine whether\nthe ultimate resolution of the matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or operations.\nOn September 14, 2021, Cachet Financial Services (“Cachet”) filed an adversary proceeding against the Bank in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central\nDistrict of California, titled Cachet Financial Services, Plaintiff v. The Bancorp Bank, et al., Defendants. The case was filed within the context of Cachet’s\npending Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. The Bank previously served as the Originating Depository Financial Institution (“ODFI”) for automated clearing house\n(“ACH”) transactions in connection with Cachet’s payroll services business. The matter arises from the Bank’s termination of its Payroll Processing ODFI\nAgreement with Cachet on October 23, 2019, for safety and soundness reasons. The initial complaint alleges eight causes of action: (i) breach of contract; (ii)\nnegligence; (iii) intentional interference with contract; (iv) conversion; (v) express indemnity; (vi) implied indemnity; (vii) accounting; and (viii) objection to\nthe Bank’s proof of claim in the bankruptcy case. On November 4, 2021, the Bank filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California\nto withdraw the reference of the adversary proceeding to the bankruptcy court, which was denied in February 2023. On August 3, 2022, Cachet served the Bank\nwith a First Amended Complaint wherein Cachet, among other things, withdraws its implied indemnity claim against the Bank and adds several defendants\nunaffiliated with the Bank and causes of action related to those parties. As to the Bank, Cachet seeks approximately $150 million in damages, an accounting and\ndisallowance of the Bank’s proof of claim. The Bank is vigorously defending against these claims. On September 28, 2022, the Bank filed a partial motion to\ndismiss, seeking to dispose of the majority of Cachet’s claims against the Bank. On September 12, 2024, the Bank’s partial motion to dismiss, seeking to\ndispose of the majority of Cachet’s claims was denied on procedural grounds and without reaching the issues the Bank raised in its partial motion to dismiss. On\nOctober 31, 2024, Cachet filed its Second Amended Complaint, which as related to the Bank, is substantially similar to the First Amended Complaint; however,\nthe Second Amended Complaint seeks only “damages in amount to be proven at trial” whereas the First Amended Complaint sought “damages in amount to be\nproven but in no event less than $150 million.” The Bank will defend against the Second Amended Complaint and respond to the Second Amended Complaint\nin compliance with applicable deadlines, as may be amended. The Company is not yet able to determine whether the ultimate resolution of this matter will have\na material adverse effect on the Company’s financial conditions or operations.\nOn March 27, 2023, the Bank received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) seeking documents\nand information related to the Bank’s escheatment practices in connection with certain accounts offered through one of the Bank’s program partners. The Bank\ncontinues to cooperate with the CFPB, including by responding to the CID. While the Company remains confident in the Bank’s escheatment practices, it\ncannot predict the timing or final outcome of the investigation. Future costs related to this matter may be material and could continue to be material at least\nthrough the completion of the investigation.\nOn November 21, 2023, TBBK Card Services, Inc. (“TBBK Card”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, was served with a complaint filed in the Superior\nCourt of the State of California, captioned People of the State of California, acting by and through San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu, Plaintiff v.\nInComm Financial Services, Inc., TBBK Card Services, Inc., Sutton Bank, Pathward, N.A., and Does 1-10, Defendants. The complaint principally alleges that\nthe defendants engaged in unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business acts and practices related to the packaging of “Vanilla” prepaid cards and the refund process\nfor unauthorized transactions that occurred due to card draining practices. On December 14, 2023, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California. On March 26, 2024, the case was remanded to the Superior Court of the State of California. TBBK Card is vigorously\ndefending against the claims. On May 6, 2024, TBBK Card filed a motion to quash service of summons as to TBBK Card for lack of personal jurisdiction,\nwhich is still pending. The Company is not yet able to determine whether the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s financial conditions or operations.\nIn addition, we are a party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Management believes that none of these\nactions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations.\nNote 14. Segment Financials\nThe Company’s operations can be classified under three segments: payments, specialty finance and corporate. The chief operating decision maker for these\nsegments is the Chief Executive Officer. The payments segment includes the deposit balances and non-interest income generated by prepaid, debit and other\ncard accessed accounts, ACH proccessing and other payments related processing. It also includes loan balances and interest and non-interest income from credit\nproducts generated through payment relationships. Specialty finance includes: (i) REBL (real estate bridge lending) comprised primarily of apartment building\nrehabilitation loans (ii) institutional banking comprised primarily of security-backed lines of credit, cash value insurance policy-backed lines of credit and\nadvisor financing and (iii) commercial loans comprised primarily of SBA loans and direct lease financing. It also includes deposits generated by those business\nlines. Corporate includes the Company’s investment securities, corporate overhead and expenses which have not been allocated to segments. Expenses not\nallocated include certain management, board oversight, administrative, legal, IT and technology infrastructure, human resouces, audit, regulatory and CRA,\nfinance and accounting, marketing and other corporate expenses.\n36\nIn the segment reporting below, a non-GAAP subtotal is shown, captioned “Income before non-interest expense allocation”. That subtotal presents an income\nsubotal before consideration of allocated corporate expenses which might be fixed, semi-fixed or otherwise resist changes without regard to a particular line of\nbusiness. It also reflects a market-based allocation of interest expense to financing segments which utilize funding from deposits generated by the payments\nsegment, which earns offsetting interest income. That allocation is shown in the “Interest allocation” line item. The rate utilized for the allocation corresponds\nto an estimated average of the three year FHLB rate. The payments segment interest expense line item consists of interest expense actually incurred to generate\nits deposits, which is the Company’s actual cost of funds. That actual cost is allocated to the corporate segment which requires funding for the Company’s\ninvestment securities portfolio.\nThe more significant non-interest expense categories correspond to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and include salaries and employee\nbenefits, data processing and software expenses that are incurred directly by those segments. Expenses incurred by departments which provide support services\nto the segments also include those categories of expense and others which are allocated to segments based on estimated usage. Those support department\nallocations are reflected in the “Risk, financial crimes and compliance” and “Information technology and operations” line items. Other expenses not shown\nseparately are monitored for purposes of expense management, but, unless atypically high, are ordinarily of lesser significance than the categories noted above.\nFor the payments segment, deposit growth and the cost thereof and non-interest income growth, are factors in the decision making process and are respectively\nreported in the consolidated statemens of operations. For specialty finance, loan growth and related yields are factors in decision making. Comparative loan\nbalance information measuring loan growth is presented in Note-E Loans. In addition to consideration of the above profitability and growth aspects of its\noperations, decision making is focused on the management of current and future potential risks. Such risks include, but are not limited to, credit, interest rate,\nliquidity, regulatory, and reputation. The loan committee provides support and oversight for credit risk, while the asset liability committee provides support and\noversight over pricing, duration and liquidity. The risk committee provides further oversight over those areas in addition to regulatory, reputation and other\nrisks.\nThe following tables provide segment information for the periods indicated

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides information about the Company’s\nresults of operations, financial condition, liquidity and asset quality. This information is intended to facilitate your understanding and assessment of significant\nchanges and trends related to our financial condition and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our financial information in our\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”) and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nImportant Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nWhen used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, statements regarding The Bancorp’s business, that are not historical facts, are “forward-looking\nstatements.” These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including, but not limited to the words “intend,” “may,” “believe,”\n“will,” “expect,” “look,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “continue,” or similar words. Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to,\nstatements regarding our annual fiscal 2024 results, profitability, and increased volumes, and relate to our current assumptions, projections, and expectations\nabout our business and future events, including current expectations about important economic, political, and technological factors, among other factors, and\nare subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause the actual results, events, or achievements to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the\nforward-looking statements and related assumptions. Factors that could cause results to differ from those expressed in the forward-looking statements also\ninclude, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties referenced or described in The Bancorp’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nincluding the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and other documents that the Company files from time to time with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission as well as the following:\n· continued movement in interest rates and the resulting impact on net interest income;\n· changes in the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and its agencies;\n· the impacts of recent volatility in the banking sector and actual or perceived concerns regarding the liquidity and soundness of other financial\ninstitutions;\n· adverse changes in general economic and business conditions, including the impact of such conditions on the market value of real estate securing\ncertain of our loans;\n· levels of net charge-offs and the adequacy of the ACL in covering expected losses;\n· any significant increase in the level of the Bank’s deposits that are uninsured by the FDIC, or are otherwise regulated, including as a result of the\nimplementation or adoption of pending regulatory change;\n· any failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to new products, services and technology and achieve our strategic priorities,\nsuch as growing payments-related deposit accounts;\n· our entry into consumer fintech lending and its future potential impact on our operations and financial condition;\n· the impact on our stock price as a result of speculative or short trading strategies;\n· weather events, natural disasters, geopolitical events, public health crises and other catastrophic events beyond our control;\n· the outcome of regulatory matters or investigations, litigation, and other legal actions; and\n· our ability to identify and prevent cyber-security incidents, such as data security breaches, ransomware, malware intrusion, or other attacks.\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof and are based on information presently\navailable to the management of the Company. We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q except as required by applicable law.\nRecent Developments\nAs previously disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for an apartment\nproperty acquired by our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Bancorp Bank, National Association, through foreclosure in connection with a real estate bridge lending\n(“REBL”) loan. At September 30, 2024, the related $40.3 million balance, comprised the majority of our OREO. Subsequent to the previously reported\n$125,000 earnest money deposit in July 2024, the purchaser has made additional earnest money deposits of $250,000 bringing the total of such deposits to\n$375,000 in 2024. Additional required deposits are projected to total $500,000 prior to the December 31, 2024 closing deadline. The sales price is expected to\ncover the Company’s current OREO balance plus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will\nconsummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, earnest money deposits would accrue to the Company.\n40\nWhile real estate bridge loans classified as either special mention or substandard increased during the quarter, we believe that such classifications are at or near\ntheir peak. That conclusion is based, at least in part, on an independent review of a significant portion of the REBL portfolio performed during the third quarter\nby a firm specializing in such analysis. Additionally, the 50 basis point Federal Reserve rate reduction may provide immediate cash flow benefits to borrowers,\nwhile the further declining forward yield curve should support further liquidity benefits, as fixed rates decline. Moreover, respective weighted average “as is”\nand “as stabilized” LTVs of 77% and 68%, respectively, based upon appraisals in the past twelve months, continue to provide significant protection against loss.\nUnderlying property values as supported by such independent LTVs, continue to facilitate the recapitalization of certain loans from borrowers experiencing cash\nflow issues, to borrowers with greater financial capacity. At September 30, 2024, real estate bridge loans classified as special mention and substandard\nrespectively amounted to $84.4 million and $155.4 million compared to $96.0 million and $80.4 million at June 30, 2024. Each classified loan was evaluated\nfor a potential increase in the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on the basis of a third-party appraisals of apartment building collateral. On the basis of “as is”\nand “as stabilized” LTVs, increases to the allowance were not required. The current allowance for credit losses for REBL, is primarily based upon historical\nindustry losses for multi-family loans, in the absence of significant charge-offs within the Company’s REBL portfolio. As a result of increasing amounts of\nloans classified as special mention and substandard, the Company evaluated potential related sensitivity for REBL in the third quarter. Such evaluation is\ninherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to change as more information becomes available. As a result, the Company\nadded a new qualitative factor to its ACL with a cumulative after-tax impact of approximately $1.5 million ($2.0 million pre-tax), as described in “Note 6.\nLoans.”\nOverview\nThe Bancorp’s balance sheet has a risk profile enhanced by the special nature of the collateral supporting its loan niches, and related underwriting. Those loan\nniches have contributed to increased earnings levels, even during periods in which markets have experienced various economic stresses. Real estate bridge\nlending is comprised of workforce housing which we consider to be working class apartments at more affordable rental rates, in selected states. We believe that\nunderwriting requirements provide significant protection against loss, as supported by LTV ratios based on third-party appraisals. SBLOC and IBLOC loans are\ncollateralized by marketable securities and the cash value of life insurance, respectively, while SBA loans are either SBA 7(a) loans that come with significant\ngovernment-related guarantees, or SBA 504 loans that are made at 50-60% LTVs. Additional detail with respect to these loan portfolios is included in the\nrelated tables in “Financial Condition.” Also enhancing the Company’s risk profile is the substantial earnings impact of its payment businesses.\nNature of Operations\nWe are a Delaware financial holding company and our primary, wholly-owned subsidiary is The Bancorp Bank, National Association. The vast majority of our\nrevenue and income is currently generated through the Bank. In our continuing operations, we have four primary lines of specialty lending in our national\nspecialty finance segment:\n· SBLOC, IBLOC, and investment advisor financing;\n· leasing (direct lease financing);\n· SBLs, consisting primarily of SBA loans;\n· non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans; and\n· beginning in 2024, consumer fintech lending.\nSBLOCs and IBLOCs are loans that are generated through affinity groups and are respectively collateralized by marketable securities and the cash value of\ninsurance policies. SBLOCs are typically offered in conjunction with brokerage accounts and are offered nationally. IBLOC loans are typically viewed as an\nalternative to standard policy loans from insurance companies and are utilized by our existing advisor base as well as insurance agents throughout the country.\nInvestment advisor financing are loans made to investment advisors for purposes of debt refinance, acquisition of another investment firm or internal\nsuccession. Vehicle fleet and, to a lesser extent, other equipment leases are generated in a number of Atlantic Coast and other states and are collateralized\nprimarily by vehicles. SBA loans are generated nationally and are collateralized by commercial properties and other types of collateral. Our non-SBA\ncommercial real estate bridge loans, at fair value, are primarily collateralized by multifamily properties (apartment buildings), and to a lesser extent, by hotel\nand retail properties. These loans were originally generated for sale through securitizations. In 2020, we decided to retain these loans on our balance sheet as\ninterest-earning assets and resumed originating such loans in the third quarter of 2021. These new originations are identified as real estate bridge loans, consist\nof apartment building loans, and are held for investment in the loan portfolio. Prior originations originally intended for securitizations continue to be accounted\nfor at fair value, and are included on the balance sheet in “Commercial loans, at fair value.”\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we initiated our measured entry into consumer fintech lending, by which we make consumer loans with the marketing and\nservicing assistance of existing and planned new fintech relationships. While the $280.1 million of such loans at September 30, 2024 did not significantly\nimpact income during the quarter, such lending is expected to meaningfully impact both the balance sheet and income in the future. We expect that impact will\nbe reflected in a lower cost of funds for related deposits and increased transaction fees.\n41\nThe majority of our deposits and non-interest income are generated in our payments segment, or Fintech Solutions Group, which consists of consumer\ntransaction accounts accessed by Bank-issued prepaid or debit cards and payment companies that process their clients’ corporate and consumer payments,\nautomated clearing house (“ACH”) accounts, the collection of card payments on behalf of merchants and other payments through our Bank. The card-accessed\ndeposit accounts are comprised of debit and prepaid card accounts that are generated by companies that market directly to end users. Our card-accessed deposit\naccount types are diverse and include: consumer and business debit, general purpose reloadable prepaid, pre-tax medical spending benefit, payroll, gift,\ngovernment, corporate incentive, reward, business payment accounts and others. Our ACH accounts facilitate bill payments and our acquiring accounts provide\nclearing and settlement services for payments made to merchants which must be settled through associations such as Visa or Mastercard. Consumer transaction\naccount banking services are provided to organizations with a pre-existing customer base tailored to support or complement the services provided by these\norganizations to their customers, which we refer to as “affinity or private label banking.” These services include loan and deposit accounts for investment\nadvisory companies through our Institutional Banking department. We typically provide these services under the name and through the facilities of each\norganization with whom we develop a relationship.\nPerformance Summary\nOur net income increased to $51.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, from $50.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. Our cost of funds rose slightly to\n2.54% in the third quarter of 2024 from 2.50% in the third quarter of 2023. See “Asset and Liability Management” in this MD&A for further discussion of how\nour funding sources and loans adjust to Federal Reserve rate changes.\nPrepaid, debit card and other payment fees, including ACH, are the largest drivers of non-interest income. Such fees for the third quarter of 2024 increased $3.7\nmillion over the comparable 2023 period.\nThere was a $3.5 million provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of $1.8 million in the third quarter of\n2023.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe use a number of key performance indicators (“KPIs”) to measure our overall financial performance and believe they are useful to investors because they\nprovide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. We describe how we calculate and use a number of these KPIs and\nanalyze their results below.\n· Return on assets and return on equity. Two KPIs commonly used within the banking industry to measure overall financial performance are return on\nassets and return on equity. Return on assets measures the amount of earnings compared to the level of assets utilized to generate those earnings and is\nderived by dividing net income by average assets. Return on equity measures the amount of earnings compared to the equity utilized to generate those\nearnings and is derived by dividing net income by average shareholders’ equity.\n· Ratio of equity to assets. Ratio of equity to assets is another KPI frequently utilized within the banking industry and is derived by dividing period-end\nshareholders’ equity by period-end total assets.\n· Net interest margin and credit losses. Net interest margin is a KPI associated with net interest income, which is the largest component of our earnings\nand is the difference between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets consisting of loans and investments, less the interest on our funding,\nconsisting primarily of deposits. Net interest margin is derived by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Higher levels of\nearnings and net interest income on lower levels of assets, equity and interest-earning assets are generally desirable. However, these indicators must be\nconsidered in light of regulatory capital requirements, which impact equity, and credit risk inherent in loans. Accordingly, the magnitude of credit\nlosses is an additional KPI.\n· Other KPIs. Other KPIs we use from time to time include growth in average loans and leases, non-interest income growth, the level of non-interest\nexpense and various capital measures including equity to assets.\nResults of KPIs\nIn the third quarter of 2024, return on assets and return on equity amounted to 2.55% and 25.74% (annualized), respectively, compared to 2.71% and 26.12%\n(annualized) in the third quarter of 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, return on assets, and return on equity amounted to 2.76% and\n26.61% (annualized), respectively, compared to 2.66% and 27.01% (annualized) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.\n42\nAt September 30, 2024, the ratio of equity to assets was 10.07%, compared to 10.36% at September 30, 2023, reflecting an increase in equity capital from\nretained earnings and an increase in unrealized income on securities partially offset by share repurchases. The ratio fell slightly as a result of the increase in\nperiod end assets.\nNet interest margin was 4.78% in the third quarter of 2024, versus 5.07% in the third quarter of 2023. Net interest margin for third quarter 2024 was reduced by\nthe reversal of $1.6 million ($1.2 million, net of tax) of prior period interest related to both real estate bridge loans transferred to non-accrual status during the\nquarter and loan modifications with retroactive rate reductions.\nAverage loans and leases increased to $6.02 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $5.61 billion in the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit\nlosses was $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements\nin conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the\naccompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We view critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with GAAP\nthat involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations. Our critical accounting policies and estimates as of September 30, 2024, remain unchanged from those presented in the 2023 Form 10-K under Part\nII, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nResults of Operations\nComparison of third quarter 2024 to third quarter 2023\nNet Income\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $51.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, compared to $50.1 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the third\nquarter of 2023. Income before income taxes was $69.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $66.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Income\nincreased between those respective periods primarily as a result of higher net interest income, which resulted primarily from higher loan and investment\nsecurities balances and higher fintech related payment and credit fees.\nNet Interest Income\nOur net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased $4.9 million, or 5.5%, to $93.7 million from $88.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Our\ninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $139.7 million, an increase of $10.7 million, or 8.3%, from $129.0 million for the third quarter of\n2023. The increase in interest income resulted primarily from higher investment securities and loan balances as our average loans and leases increased to\n$6.02 billion for the third quarter of 2024 from $5.61 billion for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $415.0 million, or 7.4%. Related interest income\nincreased $5.9 million on a tax equivalent basis. SBLOC and IBLOC balances at September 30, 2024 were approximately 1% lower than those at June 30,\n2024, after having shown larger decreases in prior periods. At September 30, 2024, the respective balances of SBLOC and IBLOC loans were $989.3 million\nand $554.0 million, respectively, compared to $1.01 billion and $712.6 million at September 30, 2023. Loans in other categories with higher yields more than\noffset the impact of the SBLOC and IBLOC decreases, which also contributed to the higher net interest income. Of the total $5.9 million increase in loan\ninterest income on a tax equivalent basis, the largest increases were $2.2 million for all real estate bridge loans, $3.3 million for small business lending, $2.8\nmillion for leasing and $1.3 million for investment advisor financing, while total SBLOC and IBLOC decreased $4.1 million.\nOur average investment securities of $1.58 billion for the third quarter of 2024 increased $806.6 million from $771.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nRelated tax equivalent interest income increased $10.1 million, primarily reflecting an increase in balances.\nOur net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets) for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.78% compared to\n5.07% for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 29 basis points. While the yield on interest-earning assets decreased 23 basis points, the cost of deposits and\ninterest-bearing liabilities increased 4 basis points, or a net change of 27 basis points. Average interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank decreased\n$392.6 million, or 61.3%, to $247.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $639.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting the impact of the purchase of\napproximately $900 million of securities in April 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the average yield on our loans decreased to 7.73% from 7.89% for the third\nquarter of 2023, a decrease of 16 basis points. Yields on taxable investment securities in the third quarter of 2024 was 5.02% compared to 5.02% for the third\nquarter of 2023.\n43\nAverage Daily Balances\nThe following table presents the average daily balances of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity and the respective interest earned or paid on interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as average annualized rates, for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended September 30, Three months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 vs 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\nDue to\nBalance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Volume Due to Rate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAssets:\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans, net of deferred loan fees and costs(1) $ 6,017,911 $ 116,367 7.73% $ 5,603,514 $ 110,506 7.89% $ 7,956 $ (2,095) $ 5,861\nLeases-bank qualified(2) 5,151 146 11.34% 4,585 110 9.60% 15 21 36\nInvestment securities-taxable 1,575,091 19,767 5.02% 768,364 9,647 5.02% 10,124 (4) 10,120\nInvestment securities-nontaxable(2) 2,927 55 7.52% 3,005 50 6.66% (1) 6 5\nInterest-earning deposits at Federal Reserve Bank 247,344 3,387 5.48% 639,946 8,689 5.43% (5,377) 75 (5,302)\nNet interest-earning assets 7,848,424 139,722 7.12% 7,019,414 129,002 7.35%\nAllowance for credit losses (28,254) (23,147)\nOther assets 222,646 338,085\n$ 8,042,816 $ 7,334,352 12,717 (1,997) 10,720\nLiabilities and shareholders' equity:\nDeposits:\nDemand and interest checking $ 6,942,029 $ 42,149 2.43% $ 6,229,668 $ 37,913 2.43% 4,325 (89) 4,236\nSavings and money market 65,079 549 3.37% 56,538 518 3.66% 65 (34) 31\nTotal deposits 7,007,108 42,698 2.44% 6,286,206 38,431 2.45%\nShort-term borrowings 73,480 1,030 5.61% — — — 1,030 — 1,030\nRepurchase agreements — — — 41 — — — — —\nLong-term borrowings 38,235 689 7.21% 9,889 128 5.18% 493 68 561\nSubordinated debt 13,401 297 8.87% 13,401 293 8.75% — 4 4\nSenior debt 96,071 1,234 5.14% 95,714 1,234 5.16% — — —\nTotal deposits and liabilities 7,228,295 45,948 2.54% 6,405,251 40,086 2.50%\nOther liabilities 18,362 167,673\nTotal liabilities 7,246,657 6,572,924 5,913 (51) 5,862\nShareholders' equity 796,159 761,428\n$ 8,042,816 $ 7,334,352\nNet interest income on tax equivalent basis(2) $ 93,774 $ 88,916 $ 6,804 $ (1,946) $ 4,858\nTax equivalent adjustment 42 34\nNet interest income $ 93,732 $ 88,882\nNet interest margin(2) 4.78% 5.07%\n(1) Includes commercial loans, at fair value. All periods include non-accrual loans.\n(2) Full taxable equivalent basis, using 21% respective statutory federal tax rates in 2024 and 2023.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, average interest-earning assets increased to $7.85 billion, an increase of $829.0 million, or 11.8%, from $7.02 billion in the third\nquarter of 2023. The increase reflected decreased average interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of $392.6 million, the impact of which was\nmore than offset by increased average balances of loans and leases of $415.0 million, or 7.4%, and increased average investment securities of $806.6 million, or\n104.6%. The increase reflected the purchase of approximately $900 million of fixed rate securities to reduce exposure to possible future Federal Reserve rate\ndecreases. For those respective periods, average demand and interest checking deposits increased $712.4 million, or 11.4%. The interest expense shown for\ndemand and interest checking is primarily comprised of interest paid to our affinity groups.\n44\nProvision for Credit Losses\nOur provision for credit losses was $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a provision of $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The ACL was\n$31.0 million, or 0.52% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $27.4 million, or 0.51% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. As a result of a new\nqualitative factor for classified REBL loans, the provision for credit losses was increased by $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. The provision also\nreflected the impact of continuing higher leasing net charge-offs, especially in long haul and local trucking, transportation and related activities for which total\nexposure was approximately $34 million at September 30, 2024. We believe that our ACL is appropriate and supportable. For more information about our\nprovision and ACL and our loss experience, see “Item 2 – Allowance for Credit Losses,” “Item 2 – Net Charge-offs,” and “Item 2 – Non-accrual Loans, Loans\n90 days Delinquent and Still Accruing, OREO and Modified Loans,” below and “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income was $32.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $26.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The $5.3 million, or 19.9%, increase\nbetween those respective periods reflected an increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees. The increase also reflected increased ACH, card and other\npayment processing fees. Prepaid, debit card and related fees increased $2.4 million, or 11.1%, to $23.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to\n$21.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase reflected higher transaction volume from new clients and organic growth from existing clients. ACH,\ncard and other payment processing fees increased $1.3 million, or 52.4%, to $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.6 million in the third\nquarter of 2023, reflecting an increase in rapid funds transfer volume.\nConsumer credit fintech fees amounted to $1.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, as we began our entry into consumer fintech lending in the second quarter\nof 2024. Such lending may also be reflected in a lower cost of deposits, as a result of associated deposits.\nNet realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, at fair value, increased $81,000, or 15.4%, to $606,000 for the third quarter of 2024 from $525,000 for\nthe third quarter of 2023.\nLeasing related income decreased $695,000, or 39.3%, to $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 from $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nOther non-interest income increased $609,000, or 144.3%, to $1.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 from $422,000 in the third quarter of 2023 which\nreflected increased payoff fees on advisor financing loans.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense was $53.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $5.8 million, or 12.2%, compared to $47.5 million for the third quarter\nof 2023. An 11.0%, increase in salaries and employee benefits expense reflected increases in payments related financial crimes and IT salary expense and an\nincrease in incentive compensation expenses.\nThe following table presents the principal categories of non-interest expense for the periods indicated:\nFor the three months en ded September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 33,821 $ 30,475 $ 3,346 11.0%\nDepreciation 1,047 644 403 62.6%\nRent and related occupancy cost 1,734 1,510 224 14.8%\nData processing expense 1,408 1,404 4 0.3%\nAudit expense 403 446 (43) (9.6%)\nLegal expense 1,055 1,203 (148) (12.3%)\nFDIC insurance 904 806 98 12.2%\nSoftware 4,561 4,427 134 3.0%\nInsurance 1,246 1,321 (75) (5.7%)\nTelecom and IT network communications 283 305 (22) (7.2%)\nConsulting 418 448 (30) (6.7%)\nWrite-downs and other losses on other real estate owned — 131 (131) (100.0%)\nOther 6,375 4,339 2,036 46.9%\nTotal non-interest expense $ 53,255 $ 47,459 $ 5,796 12.2%\n45\nChanges in non-interest expense were as follows:\n· Salaries and employee benefits expense increased to $33.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $3.3 million, or 11.0%, from\n$30.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n· Depreciation expense increased $403,000, or 62.6%, to $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $644,000 in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting\nthe impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n· Rent and related occupancy cost increased $224,000, or 14.8%, to $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $1.5 million in the third quarter of\n2023, reflecting the impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n· Data processing expense increased $4,000, or 0.3%, to $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2023,\nreflecting higher transaction volume.\n· Audit expense decreased $43,000, or 9.6%, to $403,000 in the third quarter of 2024 from $446,000 in the third quarter of 2023.\n· Legal expense decreased $148,000, or 12.3%, to $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n· FDIC insurance expense increased $98,000, or 12.2%, to $904,000 for the third quarter of 2024 from $806,000 in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting\nincreases in liabilities against which insurance rates are applied.\n· Software expense increased $134,000, or 3.0%, to $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase\nreflected higher expenditures for information technology infrastructure including leasing, institutional banking, cybersecurity, and enterprise risk,\nwhich more than offset decreased expenses related to financial crimes management.\n· Insurance expense decreased $75,000, or 5.7%, to $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.3 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n· Telecom and IT network communications expense decreased $22,000, or 7.2%, to $283,000 in the third quarter of 2024 from $305,000 in the third\nquarter of 2023.\n· Consulting expense decreased $30,000, or 6.7%, to $418,000 in the third quarter of 2024 from $448,000 in the third quarter of 2023.\n· Other non-interest expense increased $2.0 million, or 46.9%, to $6.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $4.3 million in the third quarter of 2023\nreflecting a $1.2 million loss from a transaction processing delay and a $652,000 increase in OREO expense. The $652,000 increase in OREO expense,\nreflected expenses on the $39.4 million apartment property transferred to OREO in the second quarter of 2024, as described in “Note 6. Loans.” The\nOREO balance of that property as of September 30, 2024 was $40.3 million.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $17.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $16.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase resulted primarily from\nan increase in income, substantially all of which is subject to income tax. A 25.4% effective tax rate in 2024 and a 24.6% effective tax rate in 2023 primarily\nreflected a 21% federal tax rate and the impact of various state income taxes.\nComparison of first nine months 2024 to first nine months 2023\nNet Income\nNet income for the first nine months of 2024 was $161.6 million, or $3.15 per diluted share, compared to $148.3 million, or $2.68 per diluted share, for the first\nnine months of 2023. Income before income taxes was $215.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $197.6 million in the first nine months of\n2023. Income increased between those respective periods primarily as a result of higher net interest income, which reflected the cumulative impact of Federal\nReserve rate increases in 2023 on the loan and securities portfolios, prior to Federal Reserve rate decreases in September 2024. Additionally, growth in higher\nyielding loan categories offset reductions in lower yielding SBLOC and IBLOC balances.\nNet Interest Income\nOur net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 increased $20.1 million, or 7.7%, to $281.9 million from $261.9 million in the first nine months of\n2023. Our interest income for the first nine months of 2024 increased to $412.8 million, an increase of $35.4 million, or 9.4%, from $377.4 million for the first\nnine months of 2023. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in loan yields resulting from the aforementioned Federal Reserve rate increases, as\nour average loans and leases increased to $5.83 billion for the first nine months of 2024 from $5.78 billion for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of\n$57.6 million, or 1.0%. Related interest income increased $21.6 million on a tax equivalent basis. At September 30, 2024, the respective balances of SBLOC\nand IBLOC loans were $989.3 million and $554.0 million, respectively, compared to $1.01 billion and $712.6 million at September 30, 2023. Loans in other\ncategories with higher yields partially offset the year over year SBLOC and IBLOC decreases, which also contributed to the higher net\n46\ninterest income. Of the total $21.6 million increase in loan interest income on a tax equivalent basis, the largest increases were $14.6 million for all real estate\nbridge loans, $9.6 million for small business lending, $8.0 million for leasing and $4.0 million for investment advisor financing, while total SBLOC and IBLOC\ndecreased $16.2 million.\nOur average investment securities of $1.26 billion for the first nine months of 2024 increased $481.8 million from $776.7 million for the first nine months of\n2023. Related tax equivalent interest income increased $18.1 million, primarily reflecting an increase in balances.\nHigher yields on loans reflected the continuing impact of Federal Reserve rate increases as variable rate loans repriced to higher rates, prior to the Federal\nReserve’s September 2024 rate reduction. Federal Reserve rate changes had an immediate impact on cost of funds, while their impact on variable rate loans\nlags. Generally, interest expense is contractually adjusted daily. The majority of our loans and securities are variable rate and generally reprice monthly or\nquarterly, although some reprice over several years.\nOur net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets) for the first nine months of 2024 was 4.96% compared to\n4.86% for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 10 basis points. While the yield on interest-earning assets increased 26 basis points, the cost of deposits\nand interest-bearing liabilities increased 17 basis points, or a net change of 9 basis points. Investment securities yields reflected the $1.3 million second quarter\n2024 impact of placing a security in nonaccrual status as described in “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein. Average\ninterest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank decreased $153.7 million, or 24.0%, to $486.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 from\n$640.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, the average yield on our loans increased to 7.90% from 7.48% for the first nine\nmonths of 2023, an increase of 42 basis points. Yields on taxable investment securities in the first nine months of 2024 increased to 4.98% compared to 4.97%\nfor the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 1 basis point.\n47\nAverage Daily Balances\nThe following table presents the average daily balances of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity and the respective interest earned or paid on interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as average annualized rates, for the periods indicated:\nN in e m onths end ed Se ptember 30, Nine mo nt hs ended Sept em be r 30,\n2024 2023 2024 vs 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\nDue to\nBalance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Volume Due to Rate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAssets:\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans, net of deferred loan fees and costs(1) $ 5,828,938 $ 345,497 7.90% $ 5,772,266 $ 324,009 7.48% $ 3,208 $ 18,280 $ 21,488\nLeases-bank qualified(2) 4,840 379 10.44% 3,920 279 9.49% 70 30 100\nInvestment securities-taxable 1,255,532 46,921 4.98% 773,485 28,820 4.97% 18,015 86 18,101\nInvestment securities-nontaxable(2) 2,905 155 7.11% 3,193 144 6.01% (11) 22 11\nInterest-earning deposits at Federal Reserve Bank 486,883 19,948 5.46% 640,554 24,271 5.05% (6,539) 2,216 (4,323)\nNet interest-earning assets 7,579,098 412,900 7.26% 7,193,418 377,523 7.00%\nAllowance for credit losses (27,993) (23,192)\nOther assets 280,733 269,072\n$ 7,831,838 $ 7,439,298 14,743 20,634 35,377\nLiabilities and shareholders' equity:\nDeposits:\nDemand and interest checking $ 6,684,671 $ 120,405 2.40% $ 6,343,711 $ 106,984 2.25% 5,923 7,498 13,421\nSavings and money market 58,777 1,453 3.30% 88,738 2,465 3.70% (763) (249) (1,012)\nTime — — — 27,802 858 4.11% (858) — (858)\nTotal deposits 6,743,448 121,858 2.41% 6,460,251 110,307 2.28%\nShort-term borrowings 55,820 2,344 5.60% 6,758 234 4.62% 2,050 60 2,110\nRepurchase agreements 4 — — 41 — — — — —\nLong-term borrowings 38,371 2,060 7.16% 9,945 382 5.12% 1,473 205 1,678\nSubordinated debt 13,401 880 8.76% 13,401 825 8.21% — 55 55\nSenior debt 95,983 3,701 5.14% 97,220 3,793 5.20% (48) (44) (92)\nTotal deposits and liabilities 6,947,027 130,843 2.51% 6,587,616 115,541 2.34%\nOther liabilities 73,507 117,822\nTotal liabilities 7,020,534 6,705,438 7,777 7,525 15,302\nShareholders' equity 811,304 733,860\n$ 7,831,838 $ 7,439,298\nNet interest income on tax equivalent basis(2) $ 282,057 $ 261,982 $ 6,966 $ 13,109 $ 20,075\nTax equivalent adjustment 112 89\nNet interest income $ 281,945 $ 261,893\nNet interest margin(2) 4.96% 4.86%\n(1) Includes commercial loans, at fair value.

The increase reflected decreased average interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of $153.7 million, the impact of\nwhich was more than offset by increased average balances of loans and leases of $57.6 million, or 1.0%, and increased average investment securities of\n$481.8 million, or 62.0%. For those respective periods, average demand and\n48\ninterest checking deposits increased $341.0 million, or 5.4%. The interest expense shown for demand and interest checking is primarily comprised of interest\npaid to our affinity groups.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nOur provision for credit losses was $7.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to a provision of $4.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. The\nACL was $31.0 million, or 0.52% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $27.4 million, or 0.51% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. As a result\nof a new qualitative factor for classified REBL loans, the provision for credit losses was increased by $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. The provision\nalso reflected the impact of continuing higher leasing net charge-offs, especially in long haul and local trucking, transportation and related activities for which\ntotal exposure was approximately $34 million at September 30, 2024. We believe that our ACL is appropriate and supportable. For more information about our\nprovision and ACL and our loss experience, see “Item 2 – Allowance for Credit Losses,” “Item 2 – Net Charge-offs,” and “Item 2 – Non-accrual Loans, Loans\n90 days Delinquent and Still Accruing, OREO and Modified Loans,” below and “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income was $92.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $85.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. The $7.1 million, or 8.4%,\nincrease between those respective periods reflected an increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees. The increase also reflected increased ACH, card and other\npayment processing fees. Prepaid, debit card and related fees increased $5.9 million, or 8.9%, to $72.9 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to\n$67.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. The first quarter of 2023 included approximately $600,000 of non-interest income related to the fourth quarter of\n2022, and a $1.4 million termination fee from a client which formed its own bank. The increase reflected higher transaction volume from new clients and\norganic growth from existing clients. ACH, card and other payment processing fees increased $2.7 million, or 37.8%, to $9.9 million for the first nine months of\n2024, compared to $7.2 million in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting an increase in rapid funds transfer volume.\nConsumer credit fintech fees amounted to $1.7 million for 2024, as we began our entry into consumer fintech lending. Such lending may also be reflected in a\nlower cost of deposits, as a result of associated deposits.\nNet realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, at fair value, decreased $2.0 million, or 47.1%, to $2.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 from\n$4.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease reflected the runoff of the commercial loans, at fair value portfolio, which has continued to reduce\nthe volume of loan payoffs and the income recognized at the time of payoff.\nLeasing related income decreased $1.9 million, or 39.4%, to $2.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 from $4.8 million for the first nine months of 2023,\nreflecting $1.1 million of losses related to an auto auction company which ceased operations.\nOther non-interest income increased $574,000, or 28.7%, to $2.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 from $2.0 million in the first nine months of 2023\nreflecting increased payoff fees on advisor financing loans.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense was $151.4 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of $6.0 million, or 4.1%, compared to $145.4 million for the first\nnine months of 2023. While salaries and employee benefits increased 4.9%, increases in the payments business and related financial crimes and in IT salary\nexpense, were offset by decreases in incentive compensation.\n49\nThe following table presents the principal categories of non-interest expense for the periods indicated:\nFor the nine months end ed September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 97,964 $ 93,427 $ 4,537 4.9%\nDepreciation 3,023 2,046 977 47.8%\nRent and related occupancy cost 5,060 4,265 795 18.6%\nData processing expense 4,252 4,123 129 3.1%\nAudit expense 1,081 1,255 (174) (13.9%)\nLegal expense 2,509 3,110 (601) (19.3%)\nFDIC insurance 2,618 2,233 385 17.2%\nSoftware 13,687 12,981 706 5.4%\nInsurance 3,866 3,935 (69) (1.8%)\nTelecom and IT network communications 908 1,044 (136) (13.0%)\nConsulting 1,558 1,412 146 10.3%\nWrite-downs and other losses on OREO — 1,315 (1,315) (100.0%)\nOther 14,887 14,286 601 4.2%\nTotal non-interest expense $ 151,413 $ 145,432 $ 5,981 4.1%\nChanges in non-interest expense were as follows:\n· Salaries and employee benefits expense increased to $98.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of $4.5 million, or 4.9%, from\n$93.4 million for the first nine months of 2023.\n· Depreciation expense increased $977,000, or 47.8%, to $3.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $2.0 million in the first nine months of 2023,\nreflecting the impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n· Rent and related occupancy cost increased $795,000, or 18.6%, to $5.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $4.3 million in the first nine\nmonths of 2023, reflecting the impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n· Data processing expense increased $129,000, or 3.1%, to $4.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $4.1 million in the first nine months of\n2023, reflecting higher transaction volume.\n· Audit expense decreased $174,000, or 13.9%, to $1.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $1.3 million in the first nine months of 2023.\n· Legal expense decreased $601,000, or 19.3%, to $2.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $3.1 million in the first nine months of 2023,\nreflecting a reimbursement of legal fees related to the Del Mar complaint described in “Note O. Commitments and Contingencies” to the audited\nconsolidated financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K.\n· FDIC insurance expense increased $385,000, or 17.2%, to $2.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 from $2.2 million in the first nine months of\n2023, reflecting increases in liabilities against which insurance rates are applied.\n· Software expense increased $706,000, or 5.4%, to $13.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $13.0 million in the first nine months of 2023.\nThe increase reflected higher expenditures for information technology infrastructure including leasing, institutional banking, cybersecurity, cloud\ncomputing and enterprise risk, which more than offset decreasing expenses related to financial crimes management.\n· Insurance expense decreased $69,000, or 1.8%, to $3.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $3.9 million in the first nine months of\n2023.\n· Telecom and IT network communications expense decreased $136,000, or 13.0%, to $908,000 in the first nine months of 2024 from $1.0 million in the\nfirst nine months of 2023.\n· Consulting expense increased $146,000, or 10.3%, to $1.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $1.4 million in the first nine months of 2023.\nThe increase reflected expenses related to the Company’s ongoing efforts of documenting and optimizing operational controls.\n· Other non-interest expense increased $601,000, or 4.2%, to $14.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $14.3 million in the first nine months\nof 2023. The $601,000 increase reflected a $1.2 million loss from a transaction processing delay and a $989,000 increase in OREO expense offset by\nthe following decreases: (i) regulatory examination fees of $272,000 and (ii) other operating taxes of $359,000. The $989,000 increase in OREO\nexpense, reflected expenses on the $39.4 million apartment property transferred to OREO in the second quarter of 2024, as described in “Note 6.\nLoans.” The balance as of September 30, 2024 was $40.3 million.\n50\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $54.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to $49.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase resulted\nprimarily from an increase in income, substantially all of which is subject to income tax. A 25.1% effective tax rate in 2024 and a 24.9% effective tax rate in\n2023 primarily reflected a 21% federal tax rate and the impact of various state income taxes.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity defines our ability to generate funds at a reasonable cost to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals, satisfy borrowing needs and otherwise\noperate on an ongoing basis. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution’s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected\ncash flows without adversely affecting daily operations or financial condition. The Company’s liquidity management policy requirements include sustaining\ndefined liquidity minimums, concentration monitoring and management, stress testing, contingency planning and related oversight. Based on our sources of\nfunding and liquidity discussed below, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for our needs in the next 12 months and for the\nforeseeable future. We invest the funds we do not need for daily operations primarily in overnight federal funds or in our interest-bearing account at the Federal\nReserve. We actively monitor our positions and contingent funding sources daily.\nOur primary source of funding has been deposits. Average total deposits increased by $720.9 million, or 11.5%, to $7.01 billion for the third quarter of 2024\ncompared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase reflected the planned exit of higher cost deposits. Federal Reserve average balances decreased to\n$247.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $639.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease reflected approximately $900 million of securities\npurchases in April 2024 as discussed under “Asset and Liability Management” in this MD&A. Additionally, as a result of those purchases, we have increased\nthe use of FHLB advances to partially fund such purchases, at least temporarily, and those advances averaged approximately $73.5 million for third quarter\n2024.\nOne source of contingent liquidity is available-for-sale securities, which amounted to $1.59 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $747.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, reflecting $900 million of securities purchases in April, 2024. In excess of $1.0 billion of these securities, including those $900 million of\nApril 2024 purchases, can be pledged to facilitate extensions of credit in addition to loans already pledged against lines of credit, as discussed later in this\nsection. At September 30, 2024, outstanding loans amounted to $5.91 billion, compared to $5.36 billion at the prior year end, an increase of $545.5 million\nrepresenting a use of funds. Commercial loans, at fair value, decreased to $252.0 million from $332.8 million between those respective dates, a decrease of\n$80.8 million, which provided funding. In 2019 and previous years, these loans were generally originated for securitization and sale, but in 2020 we decided to\nretain such loans on the balance sheet. While we suspended originating such loans after the first quarter of 2020, we resumed originations, which consist\nprimarily of non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans, in the third quarter of 2021. Such originations are held for investment and are included in “Loans,\nnet of deferred loan fees and costs” on the balance sheet. Accordingly, commercial loans, at fair value will continue to run off. Our liquidity planning has not\npreviously placed undue reliance on securitizations, and while our future planning excludes the impact of securitizations, other liquidity sources, primarily\ndeposits, are determined to be adequate.\nWhile we do not have a traditional branch system, we believe that our core deposits, which include our demand, interest checking, savings and money market\naccounts, have similar characteristics to those of a bank with a branch system. The majority of our deposit accounts are obtained with the assistance of third-\nparties and as a result have historically been classified as brokered by the FDIC. Prior to December 2020, FDIC guidance for classification of deposit accounts\nas brokered was relatively broad, and generally included accounts which were referred to or “placed” with the institution by other companies. If the Bank ceases\nto be categorized as “well capitalized” under banking regulations, it will be prohibited from accepting, renewing or rolling over any of its deposits classified as\nbrokered without the consent of the FDIC. In such a case, the FDIC’s refusal to grant consent to our accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits could\neffectively restrict or eliminate the ability of the Bank to operate its business lines as presently conducted. In December 2020, the FDIC issued a new regulation\nwhich, in the third quarter of 2021, resulted in the majority of our deposits being reclassified from brokered to non-brokered. On July 30, 2024, the FDIC\nproposed a regulation eliminating certain automatic exceptions which resulted in the reclassification of significant amounts of our deposits from brokered to\nnon-brokered as a result of the December 2020 rules changes, while retaining the ability of financial institutions to reapply. If the proposed regulation is\nadopted, significant amounts of our deposits could be reclassified as brokered, which could also result in an increase in our federal deposit insurance rate and\nexpense. Of our total deposits of $6.93 billion as of September 30, 2024, $586.8 million were classified as brokered and an estimated $485.3 million were not\ninsured by FDIC insurance, which requires identification of the depositor and is limited to $250,000 per identified depositor. Uninsured accounts may represent\na greater liquidity risk than FDIC-insured accounts should large depositors withdraw funds as a result of negative financial developments either at the Bank or\nin the economy. Significant amounts of our uninsured deposits are comprised of small balances, such as anonymous gift cards and corporate incentive cards for\nwhich there is no identified depositor. We do not believe that such uninsured accounts present a significant liquidity risk.\nCertain components of our deposits experience seasonality, creating greater excess liquidity at certain times. The largest deposit inflows occur in the first\nquarter of the year when certain of our accounts are credited with tax refund payments from the U.S. Treasury.\n51\nWhile consumer deposit accounts, including prepaid and debit card accounts, comprise the vast majority of our funding needs, we maintain secured borrowing\nlines with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve. Our collateralized line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank had available accessible capacity of $1.97 billion\nas of September 30, 2024, and was collateralized by loans. We have also pledged in excess of $2.21 billion of multifamily loans to the FHLB. As a result, we\nhave approximately $1.11 billion of availability on that line of credit which we can also access at any time. There was $135.0 million drawn against the FHLB\nline at September 30, 2024. We expect to continue to maintain our facilities with the FHLB and Federal Reserve.\nAs a holding company conducting substantially all our business through our subsidiaries, the Company’s near-term need for liquidity consists principally of\ncash for required interest payments on our subordinated debentures, consisting of 2038 Debentures, and senior debt, consisting of $100.0 million senior notes\nwith an interest rate of 4.75% and maturing in August 2025 (the “2025 Senior Notes”). Semi-annual interest payments on the 2025 Senior Notes are\napproximately $2.4 million, and quarterly interest payments on the 2038 Debentures are approximately $300,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash\nreserves of approximately $8.9 million at the holding company. Stock repurchases are funded by dividends from the Bank, as are interest payments on the\nabove debt instruments. Stock repurchases may be terminated at any time. The holding company’s sources of liquidity are primarily comprised of dividends\npaid by the Bank to the Company, and the issuance of debt.\nIncluded in our cash and cash-equivalents at September 30, 2024 were $47.1 million of interest-earning deposits which primarily consisted of deposits with the\nFederal Reserve.\nIn 2024, $179.9 million of redemptions were exceeded by purchases of $969.4 million of securities. We had outstanding commitments to fund loans, including\nunused lines of credit, of $1.77 billion and $1.79 billion as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority of our commitments are\nvariable rate and originate with SBLOC. The recorded amount of such commitments has, for many accounts, been based on the full amount of collateral in a\ncustomer’s investment account. The funding requirements for such commitments occur on a measured basis over time and would be funded by normal deposit\ngrowth. Additionally, these loans are “demand” loans and as such, represent a contingent source of funding.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\nWe must comply with capital adequacy guidelines issued by our regulators. A bank must, in general, have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.00%, a ratio of Tier I\ncapital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10.0% and a ratio of common equity tier 1 to risk weighted assets of\n6.5% to be considered “well capitalized.” The Tier I leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets for the quarter. “Tier I capital” includes\ncommon shareholders’ equity, certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less\nintangibles. At September 30, 2024, the Bank was “well capitalized” under banking regulations.\nThe following table sets forth our regulatory capital amounts and ratios for the periods indicated:\nTier 1 capital Tier 1 capital Total capital Common equity\nto average to risk-weighted to risk-weighted tier 1 to risk\nassets ratio assets ratio assets ratio weighted assets\nAs of September 30, 2024\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 9.86% 13.62% 14.19% 13.62%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 10.94% 15.11% 15.67% 15.11%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\nAs of December 31, 2023\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 11.19% 15.66% 16.23% 15.66%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 12.37% 17.35% 17.92% 17.35%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\nAsset and Liability Management\nThe management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is essential to controlling interest rate risk and optimizing interest margins. An interest rate sensitive asset\nor liability is one that, within a defined time period, either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market rates. Interest rate\nsensitivity measures the relative volatility of an institution’s interest margin resulting from changes in market interest rates. While it is difficult to predict the\nimpact of inflation and responsive Federal Reserve rate changes on our net interest income, the Federal Reserve has historically utilized increases in the\novernight federal funds rate as one tool in fighting inflation. As a result of high rates of inflation, the Federal Reserve raised rates in each quarter of 2022 and in\nthe first three quarters of 2023. In the third quarter of 2024 the Federal Reserve began lowering rates. Our largest funding source, prepaid and debit card deposit\naccounts, contractually adjusts to only a portion of increases or decreases in rates which are largely determined by such Federal Reserve actions. That pricing\nhas generally supported the maintenance of a balance sheet for which net interest income tends to increase with increases in rates. While deposits reprice to only\na portion of Federal Reserve rate changes, such changes are immediate. Interest-earning\n52\nassets, comprised primarily of loans and securities, tend to adjust more fully to rate increases at lagged contractual pricing intervals. The majority of our loans\nand securities are variable rate and generally reprice monthly or quarterly, although some reprice over several years. Additionally, the impact of loan interest\nrate floors which must be exceeded before rates on certain loans increase, may result in decreases in net interest income with lesser increases in rates.\nCumulative 2022 Federal Reserve interest rate increases resulted in contractual rates on loans generally exceeding rate floors beginning in the second quarter of\n2022.\nWe have adopted policies designed to manage net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements. To effectively administer\nthe policies and to monitor our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintain an asset/liability committee, consisting of the Bank’s Chief Executive\nOfficer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer and others. This committee meets quarterly to review our financial results,\ndevelop strategies to optimize margins and to respond to market conditions. The primary goal of our policies is to optimize margins and manage interest rate\nrisk, subject to overall policy constraints for prudent management of interest rate risk.\nWe monitor, manage and control interest rate risk through a variety of techniques, including the use of traditional interest rate sensitivity analysis (also known\nas “gap analysis”) and an interest rate risk management model. With the interest rate risk management model, we project future net interest income and then\nestimate the effect of various changes in interest rates on that projected net interest income. We also use the interest rate risk management model to calculate the\nchange in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios. Traditional gap analysis involves arranging our interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities by repricing periods and then computing the difference (or “interest rate sensitivity gap”) between the assets and liabilities that we estimate\nwill reprice during each time period and cumulatively through the end of each time period.\nBoth interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis are done at a specific point in time and involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions.\nInterest rate sensitivity modeling requires, among other things, estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest-earning\nassets and interest-bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates, future cash flows and discount rates. Gap analysis requires estimates as to\nwhen individual categories of interest-sensitive assets and liabilities will re-price, and assumes that assets and liabilities assigned to the same repricing period\nwill reprice at the same time and in the same amount. Gap analysis does not account for the fact that repricing of assets and liabilities is discretionary and\nsubject to competitive and other pressures. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate\nsensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets. During a period of\nfalling interest rates, a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest\nincome. During a period of rising interest rates, a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to\naffect net interest income adversely.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing structure of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at September 30, 2024.\nExcept as stated below, the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the\ncontractual terms of each asset or liability. The majority of transaction and savings balances are assumed to be “core” deposits, or deposits that will generally\nremain with us regardless of market interest rates. We estimate the repricing characteristics of these deposits based on historical performance, past experience,\njudgmental predictions and other deposit behavior assumptions. However, we may choose not to reprice liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest\nrates for competitive or other reasons. Additionally, although non-interest-bearing transaction accounts are not paid interest, we estimate certain of the balances\nwill reprice as a result of the contractual fees that are paid to the affinity groups which are based upon a rate index, and therefore are included in interest\nexpense. We have adjusted the transaction account balances in the table downward, to better reflect the impact of their partial adjustment to changes in rates.\nLoans and security balances, which adjust more fully to market rate changes, are based upon actual balances. The table does not assume any prepayment of\nfixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow, including prepayments based on historical data and current\nmarket trends. The table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on our net interest income because the repricing and related\nbehavior of certain categories of assets and liabilities (for example, prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits) is beyond our control. As a result, certain\nassets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a stated period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels. For instance, the majority of\nREBL loans are variable rate with floors, but prepayments may offset the benefit of such floors in decreasing rate environments.\n53\n1-90 91-364 1-3 3-5 Over 5\nDays Days Years Years Years\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest-earning assets:\nCommercial loans, at fair value $ 97,651 $ 70,063 $ 36,693 $ 45,639 $ 1,958\nLoans, net of deferred loan fees and costs 3,272,423 361,862 1,412,639 661,164 198,528\nInvestment securities 287,224 90,039 113,612 222,872 874,542\nInterest-earning deposits 47,105 — — — —\nTotal interest-earning assets 3,704,403 521,964 1,562,944 929,675 1,075,028\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nTransaction accounts as adjusted(1) 3,422,064 — — — —\nSavings and money market 81,624 — — — —\nShort-term borrowings 135,000 — — — —\nSenior debt and subordinated debentures 13,401 96,125 — — —\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,652,089 96,125 — — —\nGap $ 52,314 $ 425,839 $ 1,562,944 $ 929,675 $ 1,075,028\nCumulative gap $ 52,314 $ 478,153 $ 2,041,097 $ 2,970,772 $ 4,045,800\nGap to assets ratio 1% 5% 19% 12% 13%\nCumulative gap to assets ratio 1% 6% 25% 37% 50%\n(1) Transaction accounts are comprised primarily of demand deposits. While demand deposits are non-interest-bearing, related fees paid to affinity groups may reprice according to specified indices.\nThe methods used to analyze interest rate sensitivity in this table have a number of limitations. Certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in\ninterest rates even though they reprice or mature in the same or similar time periods. The interest rates on certain assets and liabilities may change at different\ntimes than market interest rates, with some changing in advance of changes in market rates and some lagging behind changes in market rates. Additionally, the\nactual prepayments and withdrawals we experience when interest rates change may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the data shown in\nthe table. Accordingly, actual results can and often do differ from projections.\nWe believe that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable; however, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments, as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income, could vary\nsubstantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from presumed behavior of various deposit and loan categories. The following table\nshows the effects of interest rate shocks on our net portfolio value described as Market Value of Portfolio Equity (“MVPE”) and net interest income. Rate\nshocks assume that current interest rates change immediately and sustain parallel shifts. For interest rate increases or decreases of 100 and 200 basis points, our\npolicy includes a guideline that our MVPE ratio should not decrease more than 10% and 15%, respectively, and that net interest income should not decrease\nmore than 10% and 15%, respectively. As illustrated in the following table, we complied with our asset/liability policy guidelines at September 30, 2024. While\nour modeling suggests that rate increases of 100 and 200 basis points will have a positive impact on net interest income (as shown in the table below), the actual\namount of such increase cannot be determined, and there can be no assurance any increase will be realized. Because the Company has emphasized variable rate\ninstruments in its loan and investment portfolios, it tends to benefit from higher interest rate environments. As a result of the Federal Reserve rate increases in\n2022 and 2023, net interest income has increased and exceeded prior period levels. Future Federal Reserve rate reductions may result in a return to lower net\ninterest income levels. In April 2024, the Company purchased approximately $900 million of fixed rate commercial and residential mortgage securities of\nvarying maturities to reduce its exposure to lower levels of net interest income, in anticipation of Federal Reserve rate reductions. In September 2024, the\nFederal Reserve began to lower rates. Such purchases would also reduce the additional net interest income which would result should the Federal Reserve\nincrease rates. Those purchases had respective estimated weighted average yields and lives of approximately 5.11% and eight years.\nNet portfo lio val ue at Net inter est inco me\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nPercentage Percentage\nRate scenario Amount change Amount change\n(Dollars in thousands)\n+200 basis points $ 1,290,352 (0.18%) $ 398,838 3.24%\n+100 basis points 1,291,651 (0.08%) 392,592 1.62%\nFlat rate 1,292,728 — 386,330 —\n-100 basis points 1,281,804 (0.85%) 379,965 (1.65%)\n-200 basis points 1,262,175 (2.36%) 374,342 (3.10%)\n54\nFinancial Condition\nGeneral. Our total assets at September 30, 2024 were $8.09 billion, of which our total loans were $5.91 billion, and our commercial loans, at fair value, were\n$252.0 million. At December 31, 2023, our total assets were $7.71 billion, of which our total loans were $5.36 billion, and our commercial loans, at fair value\nwere $332.8 million. The increase in assets reflected an increase in available-for-sale securities, which resulted from the previously discussed $900 million of\nApril 2024 securities purchases. The increase also reflected loan growth in various loan categories, which offset decreases both in SBLOC and IBLOC loan\nbalances and in commercial loans, at fair value as that portfolio continues to run off.\nInterest-earning Deposits\nAt September 30, 2024, we had a total of $47.1 million of interest-earning deposits compared to $1.03 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of\n$986.2 million. These deposits were comprised primarily of balances at the Federal Reserve. The decrease reflected the utilization of these overnight balances\nfor the aforementioned securities purchases in the second quarter of 2024.\nInvestment Portfolio\nFor detailed information on the composition and maturity distribution of our investment portfolio, see “Note 5. Investment Securities” to the unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements herein. Total investment securities increased to $1.59 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $840.8 million, or 112.5%,\nfrom December 31, 2023, as a result of the aforementioned $900 million of securities purchases in April 2024.\nUnder the accounting guidance related to CECL, changes in fair value of securities unrelated to credit losses continue to be recognized through equity.\nHowever, credit-related losses are recognized through an allowance, rather than through a reduction in the amortized cost of the security. CECL accounting\nguidance also permits the reversal of allowances for credit deterioration in future periods based on improvements in credit, which was not included in previous\nguidance. Generally, a security’s credit-related loss is the difference between its amortized cost basis and the best estimate of its expected future cash flows\ndiscounted at the security’s effective yield. That difference is recognized through the income statement, as with prior guidance, but is renamed a provision for\ncredit loss. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized no credit-related losses on our portfolio.\nInvestments in FHLB, ACBB and Federal Reserve Bank stock are recorded at cost and amounted to $21.7 million at September 30, 2024 and $15.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. Each of these institutions require their correspondent banking institutions to hold stock as a condition of membership. The Bank’s\nconversion to a national charter required the purchase of $11.0 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock in September 2022. Additionally, in the second quarter of\n2023, we joined the FHLB of Des Moines, which required a $9.1 million purchase of stock. While a fixed stock amount is required by each of these institutions,\nthe FHLB stock requirement increases or decreases with the level of borrowing activity.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 no investment securities were encumbered, as lines of credit established for borrowings were collateralized by\nloans.\nThe following table shows the contractual maturity distribution and the weighted average yield of our investment portfolio securities as of September 30, 2024\n(dollars in thousands). The weighted average yield was calculated by dividing the amount of individual securities to total securities in each category,\nmultiplying by the yield of the individual security and adding the results of those individual computations.\nAfter After\nZero one to five to Over\nto one Average five Average ten Average ten Average\nAvailable-for-sale year yield years yield years yield years yield Total\nU.S. Government agency securities $ 1,128 2.48% $ 6,550 2.79% $ 14,870 4.95% $ 8,470 3.86% $ 31,018\nAsset-backed securities 2,748 7.07% 10,565 6.88% 178,605 6.84% 45,006 6.64% 236,924\nTax-exempt obligations of states and political\nsubdivisions(1) 1,000 3.10% 1,869 2.65% 2,017 3.87% 3,045 4.50% 7,931\nTaxable obligations of states and political\nsubdivisions 14,708 3.15% 19,125 3.42% 1,174 4.33% — — 35,007\nResidential mortgage-backed securities — — 279 2.60% 5,096 4.55% 458,233 5.01% 463,608\nCollateralized mortgage obligation securities — — 4,302 2.75% 14 3.39% 24,177 3.93% 28,493\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities 41,650 2.37% 88,207 3.45% 538,883 4.82% 116,568 4.21% 785,308\nTotal $ 61,234 $ 130,897 $ 740,659 $ 655,499 $ 1,588,289\nWeighted average yield 2.78% 3.65% 5.30% 4.92%\n(1) If adjusted to their taxable equivalents, yields would approximate 3.92%, 3.35%, 4.90%, and 5.70% for zero to one year, one to five years, five to ten years, and over ten years, respectively, at a\nfederal tax rate of 21%.\n55\nPrior to 2020, the Company sponsored the structuring of commercial mortgage loan securitizations, and in 2020, the Company decided not to pursue additional\nsecuritizations. The loans previously sold to the commercial mortgage-backed securitizations were transitional commercial mortgage loans made to improve\nand rehabilitate existing properties which already had cash flow. Servicing rights were not retained. Each of the securitizations is considered a variable interest\nentity of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Further, true sale accounting has been applicable to each of the securitizations, as supported by a\nreview performed by an independent third-party consultant. In each of the securitizations, the Company obtained a tranche of certificates which are accounted\nfor as available-for-sale debt securities. The securities were recorded at fair value at acquisition, which was determined by an independent third-party based on\nthe discounted cash flow method using unobservable (level 3) inputs.\nOf the six securities purchased by the Bank from our securitizations, all have been repaid except one issued by CRE-2, which is included in the commercial\nmortgage-backed securities classification in investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance of the Bank’s CRE-2-issued security was\n$12.6 million, and it is subordinate to the repayment of a senior tranche with a remaining balance of $1.5 million and servicer obligations of $2.0 million. Thus,\na total of $16.1 million is required for the Bank’s tranche to be repaid. The sole repayment source for the $16.1 million consists of the disposition of a suburban\noffice building in New Jersey and a retail facility in Missouri. In the second quarter of 2024, the Bank received updated appraisals from the servicer for both\nproperties which lowered estimated combined appraised values to $23.7 million. The excess of the $23.7 million appraised values over the $16.1 million to be\nrepaid provides repayment protection for the Bank-owned tranche and accrued interest thereon. As a result of the reduced excess of appraised value over the\nBank’s principal and accruing interest, the $12.6 million principal was placed in nonaccrual status and $1.3 million was reversed from securities interest in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. While the appraised values allocable to the Bank’s security exceed the principal and unpaid interest, there can be no assurance as to the\namounts received upon the servicer’s disposition of these properties, which will reflect additional servicing fees, actual disposition prices and other disposition\ncosts. The New Jersey suburban office complex is being marketed by the debtor in possession who expects a contract for sale by the end of 2024. The Missouri\nretail facility is held as real estate owned by the security’s trust and a sale is in process.\nCommercial Loans, at Fair Value\nCommercial loans, at fair value are comprised of non-SBA commercial real estate loans and SBA loans which had been originated for sale or securitization\nthrough the first quarter of 2020, and which are now being held on the balance sheet. SBA loans are valued on a pooled basis and commercial real estate bridge\nloans are valued individually. Commercial loans, at fair value decreased to $252.0 million at September 30, 2024 from $332.8 million at December 31, 2023,\nprimarily reflecting the impact of loan repayments as this portfolio runs off. These loans continue to be accounted for at fair value. In the third quarter of 2021\nwe resumed originating non-SBA commercial real estate loans, after suspending such originations in the first quarter of 2020. These originations reflect lending\ncriteria similar to the existing loan portfolio and are primarily comprised of multifamily (apartment buildings) collateral. The new originations, which are\nintended to be held for investment, are accounted for at amortized cost.\nLoan Portfolio. Total loans increased to $5.91 billion at September 30, 2024 from $5.36 billion at December 31, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes our loan portfolio, excluding loans held at fair value, by loan category for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBL non-real estate $ 179,915 $ 137,752\nSBL commercial mortgage 665,608 606,986\nSBL construction 30,158 22,627\nSBLs 875,681 767,365\nDirect lease financing 711,836 685,657\nSBLOC / IBLOC(1) 1,543,215 1,627,285\nAdvisor financing(2) 248,422 221,612\nReal estate bridge loans 2,189,761 1,999,782\nConsumer fintech(3) 280,092 —\nOther loans(4) 46,586 50,638\n5,895,593 5,352,339\nUnamortized loan fees and costs 11,023 8,800\nTotal loans, including unamortized loan fees and costs $ 5,906,616 $ 5,361,139\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBLs, including costs net of deferred fees of $9,582 and $9,502\nfor September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively $ 885,263 $ 776,867\nSBLs included in commercial loans, at fair value 93,888 119,287\nTotal SBLs(5) $ 979,151 $ 896,154\n(1) SBLOC are collateralized by marketable securities, while IBLOC, are collateralized by the cash surrender value of insurance policies.

The weighted average origination date “as stabilized” LTV was estimated at 61%.\n58\nThe following table summarizes our commercial real estate loans, primarily real estate bridge loans and excluding SBA loans, by state as of September 30, 2024\n(dollars in thousands):\nBalance O rigination date LTV\nTexas $ 735,320 71%\nGeorgia 261,609 70%\nFlorida 230,491 68%\nMichigan 135,879 68%\nIndiana 108,411 70%\nNew Jersey 106,875 69%\nOhio 92,387 66%\nOther States each <$65 million 676,904 71%\nTotal $ 2,347,876 70%\nThe following table summarizes our fifteen largest commercial real estate loans, primarily real estate bridge loans and excluding SBA loans, as of September\n30, 2024 (dollars in thousands).

While the value of equities has fallen in excess of\n30% in recent years, the reduction in collateral value of brokerage accounts collateralizing SBLOCs generally has been less. This is because many collateral\naccounts are “balanced” and accordingly, have a component of debt securities, which have either not decreased in value as much as equities, or in some cases\nmay have increased in value. Further, many of these accounts have the benefit of professional investment advisors who provided some protection against\nmarket downturns, through diversification and other means. Additionally, borrowers often utilize only a portion of collateral value, which lowers the percentage\nof principal to the market value of collateral.\nThe following table summarizes our ten largest SBLOC loans as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nPrincipal amount % Principal to collateral\n$ 9,465 41%\n8,319 84%\n8,031 62%\n7,904 63%\n7,356 44%\n5,334 57%\n5,204 65%\n4,996 58%\n4,962 56%\n4,894 43%\nTotal and weighted average $ 66,465 58%\n59\nIBLOC loans are backed by the cash value of life insurance policies which have been assigned to us.

For detailed information on the ACL methodology, see “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial\nstatements herein.\nAt September 30, 2024, the ACL amounted to $31.0 million, which represented a $3.6 million increase compared to the $27.4 million ACL at December 31,\n2023. The increase reflected the impact of a new qualitative factor for classified REBL loans, as the provision for credit losses was accordingly increased by\n$2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase also reflected the impact of higher leasing net charge-offs.\n61\nA detail of the changes in the ACL by loan category and summary of loans evaluated individually and collectively for credit deterioration is as follows (dollars\nin thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor Real estate Consumer Deferred fees\nestate mortgage construction financing IBLOC financing bridge loans fintech Other loans and costs Total\nBeginning 1/1/2024 $ 6,059 $ 2,820 $ 285 $ 10,454 $ 813 $ 1,662 $ 4,740 $ — $ 545 $ — $ 27,378\nCharge-offs (431) — — (3,625) — — — — (16) — (4,072)\nRecoveries 102 — — 279 — — — — 1 — 382\nProvision (credit) (757) 252 26 5,404 (41) 201 2,387 — (156) — 7,316\nEnding balance $ 4,973 $ 3,072 $ 311 $ 12,512 $ 772 $ 1,863 $ 7,127 $ — $ 374 $ — $ 31,004\nEnding balance:\nIndividually evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 585 $ 931 $ 117 $ 1,867 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 3,500\nEnding balance:\nCollectively evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 4,388 $ 2,141 $ 194 $ 10,645 $ 772 $ 1,863 $ 7,127 $ — $ 374 $ — $ 27,504\nLoans:\nEnding balance $ 179,915 $ 665,608 $ 30,158 $ 711,836 $ 1,543,215 $ 248,422 $ 2,189,761 $ 280,092 $ 46,586 $ 11,023 $ 5,906,616\nEnding balance:\nIndividually evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 3,113 $ 4,898 $ 1,585 $ 3,919 $ — $ — $ 12,300 $ — $ 222 $ — $ 26,037\nEnding balance:\nCollectively evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 176,802 $ 660,710 $ 28,573 $ 707,917 $ 1,543,215 $ 248,422 $ 2,177,461 $ 280,092 $ 46,364 $ 11,023 $ 5,880,579\nDecembe r 3 1, 2023\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor Real estate Consumer Deferred fees\nestate mortgage construction financing IBLOC financing bridge loans fintech Other loans and costs Total\nBeginning 1/1/2023 $ 5,028 $ 2,585 $ 565 $ 7,972 $ 1,167 $ 1,293 $ 3,121 $ — $ 643 $ — $ 22,374\nCharge-offs (871) (76) — (3,666) (24) — — — (3) — (4,640)\nRecoveries 475 75 — 330 — — — — 299 — 1,179\nProvision (credit) 1,427 236 (280) 5,818 (330) 369 1,619 — (394) — 8,465\nEnding balance $ 6,059 $ 2,820 $ 285 $ 10,454 $ 813 $ 1,662 $ 4,740 $ — $ 545 $ — $ 27,378\nEnding balance:\nIndividually evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 670 $ 343 $ 44 $ 1,827 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 4 $ — $ 2,888\nEnding balance:\nCollectively evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 5,389 $ 2,477 $ 241 $ 8,627 $ 813 $ 1,662 $ 4,740 $ — $ 541 $ — $ 24,490\nLoans:\nEnding balance $ 137,752 $ 606,986 $ 22,627 $ 685,657 $ 1,627,285 $ 221,612 $ 1,999,782 $ — $ 50,638 $ 8,800 $ 5,361,139\nEnding balance:\nIndividually evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 1,919 $ 2,381 $ 3,385 $ 3,785 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 362 $ — $ 11,832\nEnding balance:\nCollectively evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 135,833 $ 604,605 $ 19,242 $ 681,872 $ 1,627,285 $ 221,612 $ 1,999,782 $ — $ 50,276 $ 8,800 $ 5,349,307\n62\nSeptember 30, 2023\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor Real estate Consumer Deferred fees\nestate mortgage construction financing IBLOC financing bridge loans fintech Other loans and costs Total\nBeginning 1/1/2023 $ 5,028 $ 2,585 $ 565 $ 7,972 $ 1,167 $ 1,293 $ 3,121 $ — $ 643 $ — $ 22,374\nCharge-offs (871) — — (2,804) — — — — (3) — (3,678)\nRecoveries 446 75 — 220 — — — — 299 — 1,040\nProvision (credit) 1,250 19 (323) 3,583 (291) 203 335 — (367) — 4,409\nEnding balance $ 5,853 $ 2,679 $ 242 $ 8,971 $ 876 $ 1,496 $ 3,456 $ — $ 572 $ — $ 24,145\nEnding balance:\nIndividually evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 566 $ 419 $ 44 $ 774 $ 17 $ — $ — $ — $ 11 $ — $ 1,831\nEnding balance:\nCollectively evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 5,287 $ 2,260 $ 198 $ 8,197 $ 859 $ 1,496 $ 3,456 $ — $ 561 $ — $ 22,314\nLoans:\nEnding balance $ 130,579 $ 547,107 $ 19,204 $ 670,208 $ 1,720,513 $ 199,442 $ 1,848,224 $ — $ 55,800 $ 7,895 $ 5,198,972\nEnding balance:\nIndividually evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 1,337 $ 2,945 $ 3,385 $ 3,351 $ 475 $ — $ — $ — $ 3,919 $ — $ 15,412\nEnding balance:\nCollectively evaluated\nfor expected credit loss $ 129,242 $ 544,162 $ 15,819 $ 666,857 $ 1,720,038 $ 199,442 $ 1,848,224 $ — $ 51,881 $ 7,895 $ 5,183,560\nA description of loan review coverage targets is set forth below.\nThe following loan review percentages are performed over periods of eighteen to twenty-four months. At September 30, 2024, in excess of 50% of the total loan\nportfolio was reviewed by the loan review department or, for SBLs, rated internally by that department. In addition to the review of all loans classified as either\nspecial mention or substandard, the targeted coverages and scope of the reviews are risk-based and vary according to each portfolio as follows:\nSBLOC – The targeted review threshold is 40%, including a sample focusing on the largest 25% of SBLOCs by commitment. A random sample of at least\ntwenty loans will be reviewed each quarter. At September 30, 2024, approximately 49% of the SBLOC portfolio had been reviewed.\nIBLOC – The targeted review threshold is 40%, including a sample focusing on the largest 25% of IBLOCs by commitment. A random sample of at least twenty\nloans will be reviewed each quarter. At September 30, 2024, approximately 57% of the IBLOC portfolio had been reviewed.\nAdvisor Financing – The targeted review threshold is 50%. At September 30, 2024, approximately 88% of the advisor financing portfolio had been reviewed.\nThe loan balance review threshold is $1.0 million.\nSBLs – The targeted review threshold is 60%, to be rated and/or reviewed within 90 days of funding, excluding fully guaranteed loans purchased for CRA\npurposes, and fully guaranteed PPP loans. The loan balance review threshold is $1.5 million and additionally includes any classified loans. At September 30,\n2024, approximately 70% of the non-government guaranteed SBL loan portfolio had been reviewed.\nDirect Lease Financing – The targeted review threshold is 35%. At September 30, 2024, approximately 57% of the leasing portfolio had been reviewed. The\nloan balance review threshold is $1.5 million.\nCommercial Real Estate Bridge Loans, at fair value and Commercial Real Estate Bridge Loans, at amortized cost (floating rate, excluding SBA, which are\nincluded in SBLs above) – The targeted review threshold is 60%. Floating rate loans will be reviewed initially within 90 days of funding and will be monitored\non an ongoing basis as to payment status. Subsequent reviews will be performed for relationships over $10.0 million. At September 30, 2024, approximately\n100% of the floating rate, non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans outstanding for more than 90 days had been reviewed.\n63\nCommercial Real Estate Loans, at fair value (fixed rate, excluding SBA, which are included in SBLs above) – The targeted review threshold is 100%. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, approximately 100% of the fixed rate, non-SBA commercial real estate loan portfolio had been reviewed.\nOther minor loan categories are reviewed at the discretion of the loan review department.\nThe following tables present delinquencies by type of loan as of the dates specified (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\n30-59 days 60-89 days 90+ days Total past due Total\npast due past due still accruing Non-accrual and non-accrual Current loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 72 $ 322 $ 758 $ 3,047 $ 4,199 $ 175,716 $ 179,915\nSBL commercial mortgage — — 336 4,898 5,234 660,374 665,608\nSBL construction — — — 1,585 1,585 28,573 30,158\nDirect lease financing 5,791 12,883 1,260 3,919 23,853 687,983 711,836\nSBLOC / IBLOC 10,251 2,014 2,383 — 14,648 1,528,567 1,543,215\nAdvisor financing — — — — — 248,422 248,422\nReal estate bridge loans(1) — — — 12,300 12,300 2,177,461 2,189,761\nConsumer fintech 4,021 4 — — 4,025 276,067 280,092\nOther loans — — — — — 46,586 46,586\nUnamortized loan fees and costs — — — — — 11,023 11,023\n$ 20,135 $ 15,223 $ 4,737 $ 25,749 $ 65,844 $ 5,840,772 $ 5,906,616\nDecember 31, 2023\n30-59 days 60-89 days 90+ days Total past due Total\npast due past due still accruing Non-accrual and non-accrual Current loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 84 $ 333 $ 336 $ 1,842 $ 2,595 $ 135,157 $ 137,752\nSBL commercial mortgage 2,183 — — 2,381 4,564 602,422 606,986\nSBL construction — — — 3,385 3,385 19,242 22,627\nDirect lease financing 5,163 1,209 485 3,785 10,642 675,015 685,657\nSBLOC / IBLOC 21,934 3,607 745 — 26,286 1,600,999 1,627,285\nAdvisor financing — — — — — 221,612 221,612\nReal estate bridge loans — — — — — 1,999,782 1,999,782\nConsumer fintech — — — — — — —\nOther loans 853 76 178 132 1,239 49,399 50,638\nUnamortized loan fees and costs — — — — — 8,800 8,800\n$ 30,217 $ 5,225 $ 1,744 $ 11,525 $ 48,711 $ 5,312,428 $ 5,361,139\n(1) The $12.3 million shown in the non-accrual column for real estate bridge loans is collateralized by apartment building property with respective 72% and 56% “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs,\nrespectively, based upon a May 2024 appraisal. “As stabilized” LTVs represent additional potential collateral value as rehabilitation progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental rates. The\ntable above does not include an $11.2 million loan accounted for at fair value, and, as such, not reflected in delinquency tables. In third quarter 2024, the borrower notified the Company that he would\nno longer be making payments on the loan, which is collateralized by a vacant retail property. Based upon a July 2024 appraisal, the “as is” LTV is 84% and the “as stabilized” LTV is 62%. Since\n2021, real estate bridge lending originations have consisted of apartment buildings, while this loan was originated previously.\nAlthough we consider our ACL to be adequate based on information currently available, future additions to the ACL may be necessary due to changes in\neconomic conditions, our ongoing loss experience and that of our peers, changes in management’s assumptions as to future delinquencies, recoveries and losses,\ndeterioration of specific credits and management’s intent with regard to the disposition of loans and leases.\nManagement estimates the ACL quarterly and for most loan categories uses relevant available internal and external historical loan performance information to\ndetermine the quantitative component of the reserve, and current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts and other factors to determine\nthe qualitative component of the reserve. Reserves on specific credit-deteriorated loans comprise the third and final component of the reserve. Historical credit\nloss experience provides the quantitative basis for the estimation of expected credit losses over the estimated remaining life of the loans. The qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL is designed to be responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and the impact of current and future economic conditions on loan\nperformance, and is subjective. The review of the appropriateness of the ACL is performed by the Chief Credit Officer and presented to the Audit Committee of\nthe Company’s Board of Directors for review. With the exception of SBLOC and IBLOC, which utilize probability of default/loss given default, and the other\nloan category, which uses discounted cash flow to determine a reserve, the quantitative components for remaining categories are determined by establishing\nreserves on loan pools with similar risk characteristics based on a lifetime loss-rate model, or vintage analysis, as described in the following paragraph. Loans\nthat do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. If foreclosure is believed to be probable or repayment is expected from the sale of\ncollateral, a reserve for deficiency is established within the ACL. Those reserves are estimated based on the difference between loan principal and the estimated\nfair value of the collateral, adjusted for estimated disposition costs.\n64\nExcept for SBLOC, IBLOC and other loans as noted above, for purposes of determining the quantitative historical loss reserve for each similar risk pool, the\nloans not assigned an individual reserve are segregated by product type, to recognize differing risk characteristics within portfolio segments, and an average\nhistorical loss rate is calculated for each product type. Loss rates are computed by classifying net charge-offs by year of loan origination and dividing into total\noriginations for that specific year. This methodology is referred to as vintage analysis. The average loss rate is then projected over the estimated remaining loan\nlives unique to each loan pool, to determine estimated lifetime losses. For SBLOC and IBLOC, since de minimis losses have been incurred, probability of\ndefault/loss given default considerations are utilized. For the other loan category discounted cash flow is utilized to determine a reserve. The Company also\nconsiders the need for an additional ACL based upon qualitative factors such as current loan performance statistics by pool, and economic conditions. These\nqualitative factors are intended to account for forward looking expectations over a twelve to eighteen month period not reflected in historical loss rates and\notherwise unaccounted for in the quantitative process. Accordingly, such factors may increase or decrease the allowance compared to historical loss rates as the\nCompany’s forward-looking expectations change. The qualitative factor percentages are applied against the pool balances as of the end of the period. Aside\nfrom the qualitative adjustments to account for forward looking expectations of loss over a twelve to eighteen month projection period, the balance of the ACL\nreverts to the Company’s quantitative analysis derived from its historical loss rates. The qualitative and quantitative historical loss rate components, together\nwith the allowances on specific credit-deteriorated loans, comprise the total ACL.\nA similar process is employed to calculate an ACL assigned to off-balance sheet commitments, which are comprised of unfunded loan commitments and letters\nof credit. That ACL for unfunded commitments is recorded in other liabilities. Even though portions of the ACL may be allocated to loans that have been\nindividually measured for credit deterioration, the entire ACL is available for any credit that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off.\nAt September 30, 2024, the ACL amounted to $31.0 million of which $11.4 million of allowances resulted from the Company’s historical charge-off ratios, $3.5\nmillion from reserves on specific loans, with the balance comprised of the qualitative components. The $11.4 million resulted primarily from SBA non-real\nestate lending and leasing charge-offs. The proportion of qualitative reserves compared to charge-off history related reserves reflects the general absence of\ncharge-offs in the Company’s largest loan portfolios consisting of SBLOC and IBLOC and real estate bridge lending which results, at least in part, from the\nnature of related collateral. Such collateral respectively consists of marketable securities, the cash value of life insurance and workforce apartment buildings. As\ncharge-offs are nonetheless possible, significant subjectivity is required to consider qualitative factors to derive the related components of the allowance.\nThe Company ranks its qualitative factors in five levels: minimal, low, moderate, moderate-high, and high-risk. The individual qualitative factors for each\nportfolio segment have their own scale based on an analysis of that segment. A high-risk ranking results in the largest increase in the ACL calculation with each\nlevel below having a lesser impact on a sliding scale. The qualitative factors used for each portfolio are described below in the description of each portfolio\nsegment. As a result of continuing economic uncertainty in 2022, including heightened inflation and increased risks of recession, the qualitative factors which\nhad previously been set in anticipation of a downturn, were maintained through the third quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, as risks of a recession\nincreased, the economic qualitative risk factor was increased for non-real estate SBL and leasing. Those higher qualitative allocations were retained in the first\nquarter of 2023, as negative economic indications persisted. In the second quarter of 2023, CECL model adjustments of $1.7 million resulted from a $2.5\nmillion CECL model decrease from changes in estimated average lives, partially offset by a $794,000 CECL model increase resulting from increasing economic\nand collateral risk factors to respective moderate-high and moderate risk levels. The elevated economic risk level for leasing reflected input from department\nheads regarding the potential borrower impact of the higher rate environment. The elevated collateral risk level for leasing reflected lower auction prices for\nvehicles and uncertainty over the extent to which such prices might decrease in the future. The adjustment for average lives reflected a change in the estimated\nlives of leases, higher variances for which may result from their short maturities. In the third quarter of 2023, there were indications of auction price\nstabilization, while the auto workers’ strike could reduce supply and drive up prices. Nonetheless, the elevated risk levels were maintained. In the second\nquarter of 2024, the provision for credit losses was reduced by $1.4 million to reflect reduced average lives for small business non-real estate loans.\nThe Company has not increased the qualitative risk levels for SBLOC or IBLOC because of the nature of related collateral. SBLOC loans are subject to\nmaximum loan to marketable securities value, and notwithstanding historic drops in the stock market in recent years, losses have not been realized. IBLOC\nloans are limited to borrowers with insurance companies that exceed credit requirements, and loan amounts are limited to life insurance cash values. The\nCompany had not, prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, increased the economic factor for multifamily real estate bridge lending. While Federal Reserve rate\nincreases directly increase real estate bridge loan floating-rate borrowing costs, those borrowers are required to purchase interest rate caps that will partially\nlimit the increase in borrowing costs during the term of the loan. Additionally, there continues to be several additional mitigating factors within the multifamily\nsector that should continue to fuel demand. Higher interest rates are increasing the cost to purchase a home, which in turn is increasing the number of renters\nand subsequent demand for multifamily. The softening demand for new homes should continue to exacerbate the current housing shortage, and therefore\ncontinue to fuel demand for multifamily apartment homes. Additionally, higher rents in the multifamily sector are causing renters to be more price sensitive,\nwhich is driving demand for most of the apartment buildings within the Company’s loan portfolio which management considers “workforce” housing. In the\nfourth quarter of 2023, an increasing trend in substandard loans was reflected in an increase in the risk level for the REBL ACL economic qualitative factor,\nwhich resulted in a $1.0 million increase in the fourth quarter provision for credit loss on loans. At September 30, 2024, real estate\n65\nbridge loans classified as special mention and substandard respectively amounted to $84.4 million and $155.4 million compared to $96.0 million and $80.4\nmillion at June 30, 2024. Each classified loan was evaluated for a potential increase in the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on the basis of the\naforementioned third-party appraisals of apartment building collateral. On the basis of “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs, increases to the allowance were not\nrequired. The current allowance for credit losses for REBL, is primarily based upon historical industry losses for multi-family loans, in the absence of\nsignificant charge-offs within the Company’s REBL portfolio. As a result of increasing amounts of loans classified as special mention and substandard, the\nCompany evaluated potential related sensitivity for REBL in the third quarter. Such evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may\nbe susceptible to change as more information becomes available. As a result, the Company added a new qualitative factor to its ACL with a cumulative after-tax\nimpact of approximately $1.5 million ($2.0 million pre-tax).\nThe economic qualitative factor is based on the estimated impact of economic conditions on the loan pools, as distinguished from the economic factors\nthemselves, for the following reasons. The Company has experienced limited multifamily (apartment building) loan charge-offs, despite stressed economic\nconditions. Accordingly, the ACL for this pool was derived from a qualitative factor based on industry loss information for multifamily housing. The\nCompany’s charge-offs have been miniscule for SBLOC and IBLOC notwithstanding stressed economic periods, and their ACL is accordingly also determined\nby a qualitative factor. Investment advisor loans were first offered in 2020 with limited performance history, during which charge-offs have not been\nexperienced. For investment advisor loans, the nature of the underlying ultimate repayment source was considered, namely the fee-based advisory income\nstreams resulting from investment portfolios under management, and the impact changes in economic conditions would have on those payment streams. The\nqualitative factors used for this and the other portfolios are described below in the description of each portfolio segment. Additionally, the Company’s charge-\noff histories for SBLs, primarily SBA, and leases have not correlated with economic conditions, including trends in unemployment. While specific economic\nfactors did not correlate with actual historical losses, multiple economic factors are considered in the economic qualitative factor. For the non-guaranteed\nportion of SBA loans, leases, real estate bridge lending and investment advisor financing, the Company’s loss forecasting analysis included a review of industry\nstatistics. However, the Company’s own charge-off history and average life estimates, for categories in which the Company has experienced charge-offs, was\nthe primary quantitatively derived element in the forecasts. The qualitative component results from management’s qualitative assessments which consider\ninternal and external inputs.\nThe following table summarizes select asset quality ratios for each of the periods indicated:\nFor the nine mo nths ended For the year ended\nor as of September 30, or as of December 31,\n2024 2023 2023\nRatio of:\nACL to total loans 0.52% 0.46% 0.51%\nACL to non-performing loans(1) 101.70% 153.04% 206.33%\nNon-performing loans to total loans(1) 0.52% 0.30% 0.25%\nNon-performing assets to total assets(1) 1.14% 0.46% 0.39%\nNet charge-offs to average loans 0.07% 0.05% 0.07%\n(1)Includes loans 90 days past due still accruing interest.\nThe ratio of the ACL to total loans increased to 0.52% as of September 30, 2024 from 0.46% at September 30, 2023 as the ACL increased proportionately more\nthan total loans. The $6.9 million increase in the ACL between those dates, reflected approximately $1.7 million of increased reserves on specific distressed\ncredits and approximately $1.0 million which was added in fourth quarter 2023 for the economic qualitative factor for an increasing trend in special mention\nand substandard real estate bridge loans. In the third quarter of 2024, $2.0 million was added as a result of a new real estate bridge loans related to an increase\nin special mention and substandard loans. Additionally, while reserves for SBLOC and IBLOC loans were reduced as a result of lower loan balances, the related\nreserve impact was more than offset by growth in other loan categories with higher ACL allocations. The lower reserve allocations for SBLOC and IBLOC\nreflect their respective marketable securities and cash value of insurance collateral. The ratio of the ACL to non-performing loans decreased to 101.70% at\nSeptember 30, 2024, from 153.04% at September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the increase in non-performing loans which proportionately exceeded the\nincrease in the ACL. As a result of the increase in non-performing loans, the majority of which was a $12.3 million REBL loan, the ratio of non-performing\nloans to total loans also increased to 0.52% at September 30, 2024 from 0.30% at September 30, 2023. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets\nincreased to 1.14% at September 30, 2024 from 0.46% at September 30, 2023, reflecting the increase in non-performing loans, and a $39.4 million loan\ntransferred to OREO in the second quarter of 2024 with a September 30, 2024 balance of $40.3 million. We intend to continue to manage the capital\nimprovements on the underlying apartment complex. As the units become available for lease, the property manager will be tasked with leasing these units at\nmarket rents. The $40.3 million balance compares to a September 2023 third party “as is” appraisal of $47.8 million, or an 84% “as is” LTV, with additional\npotential collateral value as construction progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental rates. The Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement\nfor that apartment property acquired by the Bank through foreclosure. The purchaser has made earnest money deposits of $375,000, with additional required\ndeposits projected to total $500,000 prior to the December 31, 2024 closing deadline. The sales price is expected to cover the Company’s current OREO balance\nplus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property,\n66\nbut if not consummated, earnest money deposits are expected to accrue to the Company. The nonaccrual balances in this table as of September 30, 2024, are\nalso reflected in the substandard loan totals. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.07% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 0.05%\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflected an increase in direct lease financing net charge-offs.\nNet Charge-offs\nNet charge-offs were $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.1 million from net charge-offs of $2.6 million during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Charge-offs in both periods resulted primarily from non-real estate SBL and leasing charge-offs. SBL charge-offs\nresulted primarily from the non-government guaranteed portion of SBA loans.\nThe following tables reflect the relationship of year-to-date average loans outstanding, based upon quarter end averages, and net charge-offs by loan category\n(dollars in thousands):\nSe pte mber 30, 202 4\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor Real estate Consumer\nestate mortgage construction financing IBLOC financing bridge loans fintech Other loans\nCharge-offs $ 431 $ — $ — $ 3,625 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 16\nRecoveries (102) — — (279) — — — — (1)\nNet charge-offs $ 329 $ — $ — $ 3,346 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 15\nAverage loan balance $ 157,629 $ 639,604 $ 27,739 $ 702,852 $ 1,569,727 $ 235,268 $ 2,102,691 $ 140,046 $ 49,995\nRatio of net charge-offs\nduring the period to average\nloans during the period 0.21% — — 0.48% — — — — 0.03%\nSe pte mber 30, 202 3\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor Real estate Consumer\nestate mortgage construction financing IBLOC financing bridge loans fintech Other loans\nCharge-offs $ 871 $ — $ — $ 2,804 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 3\nRecoveries (446) (75) — (220) — — — — (299)\nNet charge-offs (recoveries)$ 425 $ (75) $ — $ 2,584 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ (296)\nAverage loan balance $ 120,845 $ 518,304 $ 28,264 $ 660,022 $ 1,885,857 $ 187,414 $ 1,808,924 $ — $ 57,218\nRatio of net charge-offs\n(recoveries) during the period\nto average loans during the\nperiod 0.35% (0.01%) — 0.39% — — — — (0.51%)\nWe review charge-offs at least quarterly in loan surveillance meetings which include the chief credit officer, the loan review department and other senior credit\nofficers in a process which includes identifying any trends or other factors impacting portfolio management. In recent periods charge-offs have been primarily\ncomprised of the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans and leases. The charge-offs have resulted from individual borrower or business circumstances as\nopposed to overall trends or other factors.\nNon-accrual Loans, Loans 90 Days Delinquent and Still Accruing, OREO and Modified Loans.\nLoans are considered to be non-performing if they are on a non-accrual basis or they are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. A loan which is\npast due 90 days or more and still accruing interest remains on accrual status only when it is both adequately secured as to principal and interest, and is in the\nprocess of collection. We had $61.7 million of OREO at September 30, 2024 and $16.9 million of OREO at December 31, 2023.

On April 2, 2024, the same loan was transferred from nonaccrual status\nto OREO, and comprised the majority of our OREO at September 30, 2024, with a balance at that date of $40.3 million. We intend to continue to manage the capital improvements on the underlying\napartment complex. As the units become available for lease, the property manager will be tasked with leasing these units at market rents.

There were zero\nand $156,000 of loans classified as modified for the three month and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2023. Substantially all of the reserves at\nSeptember 30, 2024 related to the non-guaranteed portion of SBA loans.\n71\nAs a result of interest rate modifications, approximately $815,000 was reversed from interest income in the third quarter of 2024, which was applicable to prior\nperiods.\nThe following table describes the financial effect of the modifications made for the three month and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nThr ee m on ths ended September 30 , 20 24 Thr ee m on ths ended September 30 , 20 23\nCombined Rate and Maturity Combined Rate and Maturity\nWeighted average More-than- Weighted average More-than-\nWeighted average term extension (in insignificant- Weighted average term extension (in insignificant-\ninterest reduction months) payment delay(2) interest reduction months) payment delay(2)\nSBL non-real estate — — 0.46% — — —\nSBL commercial mortgage — — — — — —\nDirect lease financing — — — — — —\nReal estate bridge loans 1.27% — — — — —\nNin e m on ths ended September 30, 20 24 Nin e m on ths ended September 30, 20 23\nCombined Rate and Maturity Combined Rate and Maturity\nWeighted average More-than- Weighted average More-than-\nWeighted average term extension (in insignificant- Weighted average term extension (in insignificant-\ninterest reduction months) payment delay(2) interest reduction months) payment delay(2)\nSBL non-real estate — — 1.38% — — 0.12%\nSBL commercial mortgage — — 0.49% — — —\nDirect lease financing — 12.0 — — — —\nReal estate bridge loans(1) 1.42% — 1.23% — — —\n(1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the “as is” weighted average LTV of the real estate bridge lending balances was approximately 73%, and the “as stabilized” LTV was approximately\n66% based upon appraisals performed within the past twelve months. “As stabilized” LTVs reflect the third-party appraiser’s estimated value after the rehabilitation is complete and units are released\nat stabilized rates.

The balances for both periods were also classified as either special mention or\nsubstandard as of September 30, 2024.\n(2) Percentage represents the principal of loans deferred divided by the principal of the total loan portfolio.\nThere were no loans that received a term extension modification that had a payment default during the period and were modified in the twelve months before\ndefault.\nWe had no commitments to extend additional credit to loans classified as modified as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nWe had $25.7 million of non-accrual loans at September 30, 2024, compared to $11.5 million of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2023. The $14.2 million\nincrease in non-accrual loans was primarily due to $65.7 million of additions partially offset by $44.1 million transferred to OREO, $3.4 million of charge-offs,\n$1.5 million transferred to repossessed vehicle inventory, $2.7 million of payments and $129,000 returned to accrual status. Loans past due 90 days or more still\naccruing interest amounted to $4.7 million at September 30, 2024 and $1.7 million at December 31, 2023. The $3.0 million increase reflected $11.6 million of\nadditions partially offset by $8.6 million of loan payments and $24,000 transferred to non-accrual loans.\nWe had $61.7 million of OREO at September 30, 2024 and $16.9 million of OREO at December 31, 2023. The change in balance reflected $45.0 million\ntransferred from non-accrual loans.\nWe evaluate loans under an internal loan risk rating system as a means of identifying problem loans. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, classified\nloans were segregated by year of origination and are shown in “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein.\nPremises and Equipment, Net\nPremises and equipment amounted to $28.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $27.5 million at December 31, 2023.\n72\nOther assets\nOther assets amounted to $157.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $133.1 million at December 31, 2023.\nDeposits\nOur primary source of funding is deposit acquisition. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms, including demand, checking\nand money market accounts, through and with the assistance of affinity groups. The majority of our deposits are generated through prepaid card and debit and\nother payments related deposit accounts. At September 30, 2024, we had total deposits of $6.93 billion compared to $6.68 billion at December 31, 2023, which\nreflected an increase of $244.8 million, or 3.7%. Daily deposit balances are subject to variability, and deposits averaged $7.01 billion in the third quarter of\n2024. Savings and money market balances are a modest percentage of our funding and we have swept such deposits off our balance sheet to other institutions.\nSuch sweeps are utilized to optimize diversity within our funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to total deposits. A\ndiversified group of prepaid and debit card accounts, which have an established history of stability and lower cost than certain other types of funding, comprise\nthe majority of our deposits. Our product mix includes prepaid card accounts for salary, medical spending, commercial, general purpose reloadable, corporate\nand other incentive, gift, government payments and transaction accounts accessed by debit cards. Balances are subject to daily fluctuations, which may\ncomprise a significant component of variances between dates. Our funding is comprised primarily of millions of small transaction-based consumer balances, the\nvast majority of which are FDIC-insured. We have multi-year, contractual relationships with affinity groups which sponsor such accounts and with whom we\nhave had long-term relationships (see Item 1. “Business—Our Strategies” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023). Those\nlong-term relationships comprise the majority of our deposits while we continue to grow and add new client relationships. Of our deposits at September 30,\n2024, the top three affinity groups accounted for approximately $2.95 billion, the next three largest $1.58 billion, and the four subsequent largest $779.9\nmillion. Of our deposits at year-end 2023, the top three affinity groups accounted for approximately $2.33 billion, the next three largest $1.46 billion, and the\nfour subsequent largest $852.1 million. While certain of these relationships may have changed their ranking in the top ten, the affinity groups themselves were\ngenerally identical at both dates, with some movement in the ninth and tenth largest relationships. We believe that payroll, debit, and government-based\naccounts such as child support are comparable to traditional consumer checking accounts. Such balances in the top ten relationships at September 30, 2024\ntotaled $3.25 billion while balances related to consumer and business payment companies, including companies sponsoring incentive payments, amounted to\n$2.06 billion. Such balances in the top ten relationships at year-end 2023, totaled $2.91 billion while balances related to consumer and business payment\ncompanies, including companies sponsoring incentive and gift card payments, amounted to $1.72 billion. We pay interest directly to consumer account holders\nfor an immaterial amount of deposit balances, while the vast majority of interest expense results from fees paid to affinity groups. The vast majority of such\npayments are variable rate and equate to varying contractual percentages tied to the effective federal funds rate, which results from Federal Reserve rate hikes\nand reductions. The effective federal funds rate also reflects a market rate which might be required to replace lower cost deposits, or fund loan growth in excess\nof deposit growth, at least in the short-term. Because underlying balances have generally exhibited stability, so too have trends in the cost of funds. The more\nconsequential impact to cost of funds are market changes and the effective federal funds rate, specifically the impact of Federal Reserve rate hikes and\nreductions. We model significant fee-based relationships in our net interest income sensitivity modeling (see “Item 2 – Asset and Liability Management”\nabove). The following discussion is applicable to our transaction accounts, comprising the majority of our deposits, in the 100 and 200 basis point rate increase\nand decrease scenarios as presented in the applicable table in that Asset and Liability Management section, above. The impact of the Federal Reserve rate hikes\nor reductions, which respectively increase or decrease interest expense, has approximated the ratio of our cost of funds divided by the effective federal funds\nrate, all else equal. However, there can be no assurance that such ratios could not change significantly given the other variables discussed in the Asset and\nLiability Management section. In third quarter 2024, our demand and interest checking balances averaged $6.94 billion, compared to $6.23 billion in third\nquarter 2023. The growth primarily reflected increases in payment company balances. Average savings and money market balances increased to $65.1 million\nthe third quarter of 2024, compared to $56.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. We sweep deposits off our balance sheet to other institutions to optimize\ndiversity within our funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to total deposits. Short-term time deposits have been used\nminimally to provide liquidity cushions, for instance when short-term loan origination exceeds short-term deposit growth, as was the case in 2022. In 2023, we\ndid not use short-term time deposits after the first quarter of the year. Short-term time deposits are generated through established intermediaries such as banks\nand other financial companies. These deposits generally originate with investment or trust companies or banks, which offer those deposits at market rates to\nFDIC-insured institutions, such that the balances are fully FDIC-insured. These deposits are generally classified as brokered. While affinity groups may decide\nto pay interest or other remuneration to account holders, they do not currently do so for the vast majority of balances. The following table presents the average\nbalance and rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\n73\nThe following table presents the average balance and rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nFor the nine months ended For the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\nbalance rate balance rate\nDemand and interest checking(1) $ 6,684,671 2.40% $ 6,308,509 2.30%\nSavings and money market 58,777 3.30% 78,074 3.66%\nTime — — 20,794 4.13%\nTotal deposits $ 6,743,448 2.41% $ 6,407,377 2.32%\n(1) Of the amounts shown for 2024 and 2023, $149.1 million and $177.0 million, respectively, represented balances on which the Bank paid interest. The remaining balance for each period reflects\namounts subject to fees paid to third parties, which are based upon a contractual percentage applied to a rate index, generally the effective federal funds rate, and therefore classified as interest expense.\nShort-term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings consist of amounts borrowed on our lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank or FHLB. There were $135.0 million of borrowings\nwith FHLB at September 30, 2024. There were no borrowings on either line at December 31, 2023. We generally utilize overnight borrowings to manage our\ndaily reserve requirements at the Federal Reserve. Period-end and year-to-date information for the dates shown is as follows.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nShort-term borrowings\nBalance at period end $ 135,000 $ —\nAverage for the three months ended September 30, 2024 73,480 N/A\nAverage during the year 55,820 5,739\nMaximum month-end balance 455,000 450,000\nWeighted average rate during the period 5.60% 4.72%\nRate at period end 5.16% —\nSenior Debt\nOn August 13, 2020, we issued $100.0 million of the 2025 Senior Notes, with a maturity date of August 15, 2025, and a 4.75% interest rate, with interest paid\nsemi-annually on March 15 and September 15. The 2025 Senior Notes are the Company’s direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equal in\npriority with all our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all our existing and future subordinated\nindebtedness. In lieu of repayment of debt from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company, industry practice includes the issuance of new debt to repay\nmaturing debt.\nBorrowings\nAt September 30, 2024, we had other long-term borrowings of $38.2 million compared to $38.6 million at December 31, 2023. The borrowings consisted of\nsold loans which were accounted for as a secured borrowing because they did not qualify for true sale accounting. We do not have any policy prohibiting us\nfrom incurring debt.\nThe 2038 Debentures, which total $13.4 million, mature in March 2038 and bear interest at SOFR plus 3.51%, are grandfathered to qualify as tier 1 capital at\nthe Bank.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities amounted to $70.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $69.6 million at December 31, 2023.\nShareholders’ Equity\nAs a means of returning capital to shareholders, the Company implemented stock repurchase programs which totaled $40.0 million, $60.0 million and $100.0\nmillion, in equal quarterly amounts, respectively, in 2021, 2022 and 2023, with $200 million originally planned for 2024. Subsequently, the second quarter 2024\nplanned repurchase was increased from $50 million to $100 million, with $50 million in repurchases planned for each remaining quarter of 2024. The planned\namounts of such repurchases are generally determined in the fourth quarter of the preceding year by assessing the impact of budgetary earnings projections on\nregulatory capital\n74\nrequirements. The excess of projected earnings over amounts required to maintain capital requirements is the maximum available for capital return to\nshareholders, barring any need to retain capital for other purposes. A significant portion of such excess earnings has been utilized for stock repurchases in the\namounts noted above, while cash dividends have not been paid. In determining whether capital is returned through stock repurchases or cash dividends, the\nCompany calculates a maximum share repurchase price, based upon comparisons with what it concludes to be other exemplar peer share price valuations, with\nfurther consideration of internal growth projections. As these share prices, which are updated at least annually, have not been reached, capital return has\nconsisted solely of stock repurchases. Exemplar share price comparisons are based upon multiples of earnings per share over time, with further consideration of\nreturns on equity and assets. While repurchase amounts are planned in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, repurchases may be modified or terminated at\nany time, should capital need to be conserved.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nThere were no off-balance sheet arrangements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future\neffect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources\nthat is material to our interests.\n75\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInformation about market risk for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is included under “Asset and Liability Management” in Part I, Item 2. “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except for such information, there has been\nno material change to our assessment of our sensitivity to market risk as discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nAs noted under “Asset and Liability Management” in Part I, Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk is managed through the use of guidelines which limit interest rate exposure\nto higher interest rates. Because the Company has emphasized variable rate instruments in its loan and investment portfolios, it tends to benefit from higher\ninterest rate environments. As a result of the Federal Reserve rate increases in 2022 and 2023, net interest income has increased and exceeded prior period\nlevels. While future Federal Reserve rate reductions may result in lower net interest income, such exposure to lower rates was significantly reduced in the third\nquarter of 2024 with the purchase of fixed rate securities. In the third quarter of 2024 the Federal Reserve began lowering rates. In addition to the\naforementioned guidelines which the Company uses to manage interest rate risk, the Company utilizes an asset liability committee to provide oversight by\nmultiple departments and senior officers.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified\nin the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our\nprincipal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not\nabsolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.\nUnder the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter\nended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n76\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFor a discussion of our material pending legal proceedings, see “Note 13. Legal” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A.\n“Risk Factors” in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nStock Repurchases\nOn October 26, 2023, the Board approved the 2024 Repurchase Program, which authorized the Company to repurchase $50.0 million in value of the\nCompany’s common stock per fiscal quarter in 2024, for a maximum amount of $200.0 million. The Company increased its share repurchase authorization for\nthe second quarter of 2024 from $50.0 million to $100.0 million, which increased the maximum amount under the 2024 Repurchase Program to $250.0 million.\nUnder the 2024 Repurchase Program, the Company intends to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block\npurchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The 2024 Repurchase Program may\nbe modified or terminated at any time. With respect to further repurchases in subsequent quarters under this program, the Company cannot predict if, or when, it\nwill repurchase any shares of common stock and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of\nmarket conditions and other factors.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company’s repurchases of its common stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2024:\nTotal number of\nshares purchased as Approximate dollar\npart of publicly value of shares that may\nTotal number of Average price paid per announced plans or yet be purchased under\nPeriod shares purchased share programs(1) the plans or programs(2)\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nJuly 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024 331,267 $ 44.96 331,267 $ 85,108\nAugust 1, 2024 - August 31, 2024 356,544 48.77 356,544 67,720\nSeptember 1, 2024 -September 30, 2024 349,258 50.74 349,258 50,000\nTotal 1,037,069 48.22 1,037,069 50,000\n(1) During the third quarter of 2024, all shares of common stock were repurchased pursuant to the 2024 Repurchase Program, which was approved by the Board on October 26, 2023 and publicly\nannounced on October 26, 2023. Under the 2024 Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock totaling up to $50.0 million per quarter, for a maximum\namount of $200.0 million in 2024. The Company increased its share repurchase authorization for the second quarter of 2024 from $50.0 million to $100.0 million, which increased the maximum\namount under the 2024 Repurchase Program to $250.0 million. The Company may repurchase shares through open market purchases, including through written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 under\nthe Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act.\n(2) The 2024 Repurchase Program may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time and has an expiration date of December 31, 2024. With respect to further repurchases, the Company cannot\npredict if, or when, it will repurchase any shares of common stock, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market\nconditions and other factors.\nItem 5. Other Information\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) adopted or\nterminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as those terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\n77\nItem 6.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Organization and Nature of Operations\nThe Bancorp, Inc. (“the Company”) is a Delaware corporation and a registered financial holding company. Its primary, wholly-owned subsidiary is The\nBancorp Bank, National Association (“the Bank”). The Bank is a nationally chartered commercial bank located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and is a Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured institution. As a nationally chartered institution, its primary regulator is the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (“OCC”). The Bank has two primary lines of business consisting of its national specialty finance segment and its payments segment.\nIn the national specialty finance segment, the Bank makes the following types of loans: securities-backed lines of credit (“SBLOC”), cash value of insurance-\nbacked lines of credit (“IBLOC”) and investment advisor financing; leases (direct lease financing); small business loans (“SBLs”), consisting primarily of\nSmall Business Administration (“SBA”) loans; and non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans (“REBL”).\nWhile the national specialty finance segment generates the majority of the Company’s revenues, the payments segment also contributes significant revenues. In\nits payments segment, the Company provides payment and deposit services nationally, which include prepaid and debit card accounts, affinity group banking,\ndeposit accounts to investment advisors’ customers, card payments and other payment processing services. Payments segment deposits fund the majority of the\nCompany’s loans and securities and may produce lower costs than other funding sources. Most of the payments segment’s revenues and deposits, and SBLOC\nand IBLOC loans, result from relationships with third parties which market such products. Concentrations of loans and deposits are based upon the cumulative\naccount balances generated by those third parties. Similar concentrations result in revenues in prepaid, debit card and related fees. These concentrations may\nalso be reflected in a lower cost of funds compared to other funding sources. The Company sweeps certain deposits off its balance sheet to other institutions\nthrough intermediaries. Such sweeps are utilized to optimize diversity within its funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to\ntotal deposits.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to regulation by certain state and federal agencies and, accordingly, they are examined periodically by those regulatory\nauthorities. As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities, the Company’s and the Bank’s businesses are affected by state and\nfederal legislation and regulations.\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements of the Company, as of June 30, 2024 and for the three-and-six month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, are unaudited. Certain\ninformation and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). However, in the opinion of management, these interim financial statements include all necessary\nadjustments to fairly present the results of the interim periods presented. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction\nwith the audited financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).\nThe results of operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for the full year ending\nDecember 31, 2024.\nThere have been no significant changes as of June 30, 2024 from the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nNote 3. Stock-based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units (“RSU”) in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 718 Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). The fair value of the option or RSU is generally measured at fair value at\nthe grant date with compensation expense recognized over the service period, which is typically the stated vesting period. For option grants subject to a service\ncondition, the Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of such options on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes\nmodel takes into consideration the exercise price and expected life of the options, the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility, the\nexpected dividends on the stock and the current risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the option. The Company’s estimate of the fair value of a stock\noption is based on expectations derived from historical experience and may not necessarily equate to its market value when fully vested. In accordance with\nASC 718, the Company estimates the number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. At June 30, 2024, the Company had three\nactive stock-based compensation plans.\n9\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company granted 45,616 stock options with a vesting period of four years and a weighted average grant-date\nfair value of $21.92. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company granted 57,573 stock options with a vesting period of four years and a weighted\naverage grant-date fair value of $17.37. There were no common stock options exercised in the six-month period ended June 30, 2024. There were 13,158 stock\noptions exercised in the six-month period ended June 30, 2023.\nA summary of the Company’s stock options is presented below.\nWeighted average\nremaining\nWeighted average contractual Aggregate\nOptions exercise price term (years) intrinsic value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 622,677 $ 15.35 6.90 $ 14,453,641\nGranted 45,616 43.89 9.62 —\nExercised — — — —\nExpired — — — —\nForfeited — — — —\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 668,293 $ 17.30 6.62 $ 13,955,500\nExercisable at June 30, 2024 504,497 $ 12.00 6.08 $ 12,997,914\nThe Company granted 390,305 RSUs in the first six months of 2024, of which 355,965 have a vesting period of three years and 34,340 have a vesting period of\none year. At issuance, the 390,305 RSUs granted in the first six months of 2024 had a weighted average fair value of $42.87 per unit. The Company granted\n547,556 RSUs in the first six months of 2023, of which 514,785 have a vesting period of three years and 32,771 have a vesting period of one year. At issuance,\nthe 547,556 RSUs granted in the first six months of 2023 had a weighted average fair value of $35.00 per unit.\nA summary of the Company’s RSUs is presented below.\nWeighted average Average remaining\ngrant date contractual\nRSUs fair value term (years)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 752,255 $ 32.53 1.66\nGranted 390,305 42.87 2.46\nVested (345,390) 30.39 —\nForfeited — — —\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 797,170 $ 38.27 1.94\nAs of June 30, 2024, there was a total of $27.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards under stock-based compensation plans.\nThis cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.7 years. Related compensation expense for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023 was $3.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Related compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was\n$7.1 million and $5.9 million, respectively. The total issuance date fair value of RSUs vested and options exercised during the six months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023, was $10.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised and RSUs vested in those respective periods was\n$14.6 million and $16.4 million, respectively.\nFor the six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company estimated the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-\nScholes options pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:\nJun e 3 0,\n2024 2023\nRisk-free interest rate 4.17% 3.67%\nExpected dividend yield — —\nExpected volatility 44.76% 45.21%\nExpected lives (years) 6.3 6.3\nExpected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock and peer group comparisons over the expected life of the option. The risk-free\nrate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities\n(“STRIPS”) rate in effect at the time of the grant. The life of the option is based on historical factors which include the contractual term, vesting period, exercise\nbehavior and employee terminations. In accordance with ASC 718, stock- based compensation expense for the period ended June 30, 2024 is based on awards\nthat are ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates forfeitures using historical data or acceptable\nexpedients.\n10\nNote 4. Earnings Per Share\nThe Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by\ndividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into\naccount the potential dilution that could occur if securities, including stock options and RSUs or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and\nconverted into common stock. Stock options are dilutive if their exercise prices are less than the current stock price. RSUs are dilutive because they represent\ngrants over vesting periods which do not require employees to pay exercise prices. The dilution shown in the tables below includes the potential dilution from\nboth stock options and RSUs.\nThe following tables show the Company’s earnings per share for the periods presented:\nF or the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024\nIncome Shares Per share\n(numerator) (denominator) amount\n(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)\nBasic earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 53,686 50,937,055 $ 1.05\nEffect of dilutive securities\nCommon stock options and RSUs — 400,436 —\nDiluted earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 53,686 51,337,491 $ 1.05\nStock options for 465,104 shares, exercisable at prices between $6.87 and $18.81 per share, were outstanding at June 30, 2024, and included in the diluted\nearnings per share computation because their exercise price per share was less than the average market price for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024.\nStock options for 203,189 shares were anti-dilutive and not included in the earnings per share calculation.\nFo r the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024\nIncome Shares Per share\n(numerator) (denominator) amount\n(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)\nBasic earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 110,115 51,842,097 $ 2.12\nEffect of dilutive securities\nCommon stock options and RSUs — 485,025 (0.02)\nDiluted earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 110,115 52,327,122 $ 2.10\nStock options for 465,104 shares, exercisable at prices between $6.87 and $18.81 per share, were outstanding at June 30, 2024, and included in the diluted\nearnings per share computation because their exercise price per share was less than the average market price for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024.\nStock options for 203,189 shares were anti-dilutive and not included in the earnings per share calculation.\nF or the three months ended\nJune 30, 2023\nIncome Shares Per share\n(numerator) (denominator) amount\n(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)\nBasic earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 49,009 54,871,681 $ 0.89\nEffect of dilutive securities\nCommon stock options and RSUs — 397,959 —\nDiluted earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 49,009 55,269,640 $ 0.89\n11\nStock options for 465,104 shares, exercisable at prices between $6.87 and $18.81 per share, were outstanding at June 30, 2023, and included in the diluted\nearnings per share computation because their exercise price per share was less than the average market price for the three-month period ended June 30, 2023.\nStock options for 157,573 shares were anti-dilutive and not included in the earnings per share calculation.\nFo r the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023\nIncome Shares Per share\n(numerator) (denominator) amount\n(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)\nBasic earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 98,131 55,160,642 $ 1.78\nEffect of dilutive securities\nCommon stock options and RSUs — 493,308 (0.02)\nDiluted earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 98,131 55,653,950 $ 1.76\nStock options for 465,104 shares, exercisable at prices between $6.87 and $18.81 per share, were outstanding at June 30, 2023, and included in the diluted\nearnings per share computation because their exercise price per share was less than the average market price for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023.\nStock options for 157,573 shares were anti-dilutive and not included in the earnings per share calculation.\nNote 5. Investment Securities\nFair values of available-for-sale securities are based on the fair market values supplied by a third-party market data provider, or where such third-party market\ndata is not available, fair values are based on discounted cash flows. The third-party market data provider uses a pricing matrix which it creates daily, taking\ninto consideration actual trade data, projected prepayments, and when relevant, projected credit defaults and losses.\nThe amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair values of the Company’s investment securities classified as available-for-sale at June 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nAvailable-for-sale June 30, 2024\nGross Gross Allowance\nAmortized unrealized unrealized for Fair\ncost gains losses Credit Losses value\nU.S. Government agency securities $ 33,036 $ 6 $ (1,685) $ — $ 31,357\nAsset-backed securities(1) 274,643 404 (35) — 275,012\nTax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions 4,860 — (78) — 4,782\nTaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions 38,045 9 (935) — 37,119\nResidential mortgage-backed securities 461,132 2,308 (5,927) — 457,513\nCollateralized mortgage obligation securities 31,427 — (1,494) — 29,933\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities 759,206 3,402 (17,318) — 745,290\nCorporate debt securities 10,000 — — (10,000) —\n$ 1,612,349 $ 6,129 $ (27,472) $ (10,000) $ 1,581,006\nJune 3 0, 2 02 4\nGross Gross\nAmortized unrealized unrealized Fair\n(1)Asset-backed securities as shown above cost gains losses value\nFederally insured student loan securities $ 3,191 $ — $ (8) $ 3,183\nCollateralized loan obligation securities 271,452 404 (27) 271,829\n$ 274,643 $ 404 $ (35) $ 275,012\nAvailable-for-sale D ecember 31, 2023\nGross Gross Allowance\nAmortized unrealized unrealized for Fair\ncost gains losses Credit Losses value\nU.S. Government agency securities $ 35,346 $ 6 $ (1,466) $ — $ 33,886\nAsset-backed securities(1) 327,159 9 (1,815) — 325,353\nTax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions 4,860 39 (48) — 4,851\nTaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions 43,323 15 (952) — 42,386\nResidential mortgage-backed securities 169,882 108 (9,223) — 160,767\nCollateralized mortgage obligation securities 35,575 — (1,537) — 34,038\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities 157,759 — (11,506) — 146,253\nCorporate debt securities 10,000 — — (10,000) —\n$ 783,904 $ 177 $ (26,547) $ (10,000) $ 747,534\n12\nDecembe r 3 1, 2 023\nGross Gross\nAmortized unrealized unrealized Fair\n(1)Asset-backed securities as shown above cost gains losses value\nFederally insured student loan securities $ 6,032 $ — $ (49) $ 5,983\nCollateralized loan obligation securities 321,127 9 (1,766) 319,370\n$ 327,159 $ 9 $ (1,815) $ 325,353\nInvestments in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock, Atlantic Central Bankers Bank (“ACBB”) stock, and Federal Reserve Bank stock are recorded at\ncost and amounted to $15.6 million at June 30, 2024, and $15.6 million at December 31, 2023. At each of those dates, ACBB stock amounted to $40,000. The\namount of FHLB stock required to be held is based on the amount of borrowings, and after repayment thereof, the stock may be redeemed.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of the Company’s investment securities at June 30, 2024, by contractual maturity, are shown below (in thousands).

There were no gross realized gains on sales of securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nand June 30, 2023. There were no realized losses on securities sales for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.

At June 30, 2024, this security had a cost basis of $10.0 million, and comprises the balance of the corporate debt securities classification in the tables\nabove. The Bank provided for a potential loss for the full amount of the $10.0 million par value of the trust preferred security through a provision for credit loss\nof $10.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Interest payments on the trust preferred security have been deferred, as permitted by its terms for periods up to\nfive years. While the trust preferred security has previously been subject to interest deferral which was repaid, there can be no assurance that repayment will\noccur for the current deferral. The Company has evaluated the securities in the above tables as of June 30, 2024 and has concluded that, except for the trust\npreferred security discussed above, none of these securities required an allowance for credit loss (“ACL”).\nThe Company evaluates whether an ACL is required by considering primarily the following factors: (a) the extent to which the fair value is less than the\namortized cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on\ncontractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) changes in the financial condition of the security’s underlying collateral and (e) the payment\nstructure of the security. The Company’s determination of the best estimate of expected future cash flows, which is used to determine the credit loss amount, is a\nquantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with internal assumptions and judgments regarding\nthe future performance of the security. With the exception of the trust preferred security discussed above and the CRE-2 security discussed in “Note 6. Loans,”\nthe Company concluded that the securities that are in an unrealized loss position are in a loss position because of changes in market interest rates after the\nsecurities were purchased. The severity of the impact of fair value in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments is consistent with market\ndevelopments. The Company’s analysis of each investment is performed at the security level. The Company intends to hold its investment securities to maturity,\nand it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery.\nNote 6. Loans\nThe Company has several lending lines of business including: small business loans (“SBLs”), comprised primarily of SBA loans; direct lease financing\nprimarily for commercial vehicles and to a lesser extent equipment; SBLOC collateralized by marketable securities; IBLOC collateralized by the cash value of\neligible life insurance policies; and investment advisor financing for purposes of debt refinance, acquisition of another firm or internal succession. Prior to\n2020, the Company also originated non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans, primarily collateralized by multifamily properties (apartment buildings), and\nto a lesser extent, by hotel and retail properties, for sale into securitizations. At origination, the Company elected fair value treatment for these loans as they\nwere originally held-for-sale, to better reflect the economics of the transactions. In 2020, the Company decided to retain these loans on its balance sheet as\ninterest-earning assets and currently intends to continue doing so. Therefore, these loans are no longer accounted for as held-for-sale, but the Company\ncontinues to present them at fair value. At June 30, 2024, such loans comprised $161.1 million of the $265.2 million of commercial loans, at fair value, with the\nbalance comprised of the guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans also previously held for sale. The amortized cost of the $265.2 million commercial loans at\nfair value was $268.9 million. Included in net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on commercial loans, at fair value in the consolidated statements of\noperations are changes in the estimated fair value of such loans. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no related net unrealized losses or gains\nrecognized for changes in fair value. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, related net unrealized losses recognized for changes in fair value were $1.3\nmillion, $365,000 of which reflected losses attributable to credit weaknesses. In the third quarter of 2021, the Company resumed the origination of non-SBA\ncommercial real estate bridge loans which it also intends to hold for investment and which are accounted for at amortized cost. They are captioned as REBLs as\nthey are transitional commercial mortgage loans which are made to improve and rehabilitate existing properties which already have cash flow.\n14\nThe Bank has pledged the majority of its loans held for investment at amortized cost and commercial loans at fair value to either the FHLB or the Federal\nReserve Bank for lines of credit with those institutions. The FHLB and FRB lines are periodically utilized to manage liquidity. The amount of loans pledged\nvaries and the collateral may be unpledged at any time to the extent the collateral exceeds advances. The lines maintained are consistent with the Bank’s\nliquidity policy which maximizes potential liquidity. At June 30, 2024, $2.40 billion of loans were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank and $2.07 billion of\nloans were pledged to the FHLB against lines of credit which provide a source of liquidity to the Bank. There were no amounts drawn against these lines at June\n30, 2024.\nPrior to 2020, the Company sponsored the structuring of commercial mortgage loan securitizations, and in 2020, the Company decided not to pursue additional\nsecuritizations. The loans previously sold to the commercial mortgage-backed securitizations were transitional commercial mortgage loans made to improve\nand rehabilitate existing properties which already had cash flow. Servicing rights were not retained. Each of the securitizations is considered a variable interest\nentity of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Further, true sale accounting has been applicable to each of the securitizations, as supported by a\nreview performed by an independent third-party consultant. In each of the securitizations, the Company obtained a tranche of certificates which are accounted\nfor as available-for-sale debt securities. The securities were recorded at fair value at acquisition, which was determined by an independent third-party based on\nthe discounted cash flow method using unobservable (level 3) inputs.\nOf the six securities purchased by the Bank from our securitizations, all have been repaid except one issued by CRE-2, which is included in the commercial\nmortgage backed securities classification in investment securities. As of June 30, 2024, the principal balance of the Bank’s CRE-2-issued security was\n$12.6 million. As a result of the reduced excess of appraised value over the Bank’s principal and accruing interest based on new appraisals, the $12.6 million\nprincipal was placed in nonaccrual status and $1.3 million was reversed from securities interest in the second quarter of 2024.While the appraised values\nallocable to the Bank’s security exceed the principal and unpaid interest, there can be no assurance as to the amounts received upon the servicer’s disposition of\nthese properties, which will reflect additional servicing fees, actual disposition prices and other disposition costs.\nThe Company analyzes credit risk prior to making loans on an individual loan basis. The Company considers relevant aspects of the borrowers’ financial\nposition and cash flow, past borrower performance, management’s knowledge of market conditions, collateral and the ratio of loan amounts to estimated\ncollateral value in making its credit determinations. For SBLOC, the Company relies on the market value of the underlying securities collateral as adjusted by\nmargin requirements, generally 50% for equities and 80% for investment grade securities. For IBLOC, the Company relies on the cash value of insurance policy\ncollateral. Of the total $70.1 million of consumer fintech loans at June 30, 2024, $53.3 million consisted of secured credit card loans which the Bank makes\nwith the marketing and servicing assistance of third parties. The majority of the balances were collateralized with deposits at the Bank, with related income\nstatement impact reflected both in a lower cost of funds and fee income. The lower cost of funds results from balances required to be maintained to collateralize\nrelated card use. Related fee income is reflected in the “Consumer credit fintech fees” line of the income statement.\nMajor classifications of loans, excluding commercial loans at fair value, are as follows (in thousands):\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBL non-real estate $ 171,893 $ 137,752\nSBL commercial mortgage 647,894 606,986\nSBL construction 30,881 22,627\nSBLs 850,668 767,365\nDirect lease financing 711,403 685,657\nSBLOC / IBLOC(1) 1,558,095 1,627,285\nAdvisor financing(2) 238,831 221,612\nReal estate bridge loans 2,119,324 1,999,782\nConsumer fintech(3) 70,081 —\nOther loans(4) 46,592 50,638\n5,594,994 5,352,339\nUnamortized loan fees and costs 10,733 8,800\nTotal loans, including unamortized loan fees and costs $ 5,605,727 $ 5,361,139\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBLs, including costs net of deferred fees of $9,558 and $9,502\nfor June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively $ 860,226 $ 776,867\nSBLs included in commercial loans, at fair value 104,146 119,287\nTotal SBLs(5) $ 964,372 $ 896,154\n(1) SBLOC are collateralized by marketable securities, while IBLOC are collateralized by the cash surrender value of insurance policies. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, IBLOC loans\namounted to $582.8 million and $646.9 million, respectively.\n(2) In 2020, the Bank began originating loans to investment advisors for purposes of debt refinancing, acquisition of another firm or internal succession.

On April 2, 2024, the same loan was transferred from nonaccrual status\nto OREO, and comprised the majority of our OREO at June 30, 2024. We intend to continue to manage the capital improvements on the underlying apartment complex. As the units become available\nfor lease, the property manager will be tasked with leasing these units at market rents. The $39.4 million balance compares to a September 2023 third party “as is” appraisal of $47.8 million, or an\n82% “as is” loan to value (“LTV”), with additional potential collateral value as construction progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental rates. The Company entered into a purchase and sale\nagreement for that apartment property acquired by the Bank through foreclosure. The purchaser made an earnest money deposit of $125,000 in July 2024, with additional required deposits projected to\ntotal $500,000 prior to the December 31, 2024 closing deadline. The sales price is expected to cover the Company’s current OREO balance plus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property.\nThere can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, earnest money deposits are expected to accrue to the Company. The nonaccrual\nbalances in this table as of June 30, 2024, are also reflected in the substandard loan totals.\nInterest which would have been earned on loans classified as non-accrual for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, was $497,000 and $399,000,\nrespectively. No income on non-accrual loans was recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2024. During the six months ended June 30, 2024,\n$222,000 of REBL, $63,000 of direct leasing, $109,000 of SBL commercial real estate, and $33,000 of SBL non-real estate were reversed from interest income,\nwhich represented interest accrued on loans placed into non-accrual status during the period. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, $89,000 of legacy\ncommercial real estate, $89,000 of SBL commercial real estate, $3,000 of SBL non-real estate, and $50,000 of direct leasing were reversed from interest\nincome, which represented interest accrued on loans placed into non-accrual status during the period. Material amounts of non-accrual interest reversals are\ncharged to the ACL, but such amounts were not material during either the six months ended June 30, 2024 or 2023.\nLoans which are experiencing financial stress are reviewed by the loan review department, which is independent of the lending lines. The review includes an\nanalysis for a potential specific reserve allocation in the ACL. For REBLs, updated appraisals are generally obtained in conjunction with modifications.\n16\nDuring the three month and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, loans modified and related information are as follows (dollars in\nthousands):\nThree m on ths ended June 3 0, 20 24 Thre e m on ths ended June 30 , 2 02 3\nPayment delay as Interest rate Payment delay as\na result of a reduction and Percent of total a result of a Percent of total\npayment deferral payment deferral Term extension Total loan category payment deferral Total loan category\nSBL non-real estate $ — $ — $ — $ — — $ 156 $ 156 0.13%\nSBL commercial mortgage — — — — — — — —\nDirect lease financing — — 2,551 2,551 0.36% — — —\nReal estate bridge loans — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ — $ — $ 2,551 $ 2,551 0.05% $ 156 $ 156 —\nSix m o nth s ended June 30 , 2 02 4 Six mo nt hs ended June 30, 20 23\nPayment delay as Interest rate Payment delay as\na result of a reduction and Percent of total a result of a Percent of total\npayment deferral payment deferral Term extension Total loan category payment deferral Total loan category\nSBL non-real estate $ 1,726 $ — $ — $ 1,726 1.00% $ 156 $ 156 0.13%\nSBL commercial mortgage 3,320 — — 3,320 0.51% — — —\nDirect lease financing — — 2,551 2,551 0.36% — — —\nReal estate bridge loans(1) 26,923 32,500 — 59,423 2.80% — — —\nTotal $ 31,969 $ 32,500 $ 2,551 $ 67,020 1.20% $ 156 $ 156 —\n(1) For the period ended June 30, 2024, the “as is” weighted average LTV of the real estate bridge lending balances was less than 72.5%, and the “as stabilized” LTV was approximately 68% based\nupon recent appraisals. “As stabilized” LTVs reflect the third-party appraiser’s estimated value after the rehabilitation is complete.

The “as stabilized” loan to value\nmeasures the apartment property’s value after renovations have been completed and units have generally been released.\nThere were no loans that received a term extension modification which had a payment default during the period and were modified in the twelve months before\ndefault.\nThe Company had no commitments to extend additional credit to loans classified as modified for the periods ended June 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n18\nThere were $2.6 million and $67.0 million of loans classified as modified for the three month and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2024, respectively, with\nspecific reserves of zero and $7,000, for the three month and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2024, respectively. There were $156,000 of loans classified as\nmodified for each of the three month and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2023. Substantially all of the reserves at June 30, 2024 related to the non-\nguaranteed portion of SBA loans.\nManagement estimates the ACL quarterly and for most loan categories uses relevant available internal and external historical loan performance information to\ndetermine the quantitative component of the reserve and current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and other factors to determine\nthe qualitative component of the reserve. Reserves on specific credit-deteriorated loans comprise the third and final component of the reserve. Historical credit\nloss experience provides the quantitative basis for the estimation of expected credit losses over the estimated remaining life of the loans. The qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL is designed to be responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and the impact of current and future economic conditions on loan\nperformance, and is subjective. The review of the appropriateness of the ACL is performed by the Chief Credit Officer and presented to the Audit Committee of\nthe Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) for approval. With the exception of SBLOC and IBLOC, which utilize probability of default/loss given\ndefault, and the other loan category, which uses discounted cash flow to determine a reserve, the quantitative components for remaining categories are\ndetermined by establishing reserves on loan pools with similar risk characteristics based on a lifetime loss-rate model, or vintage analysis, as described in the\nfollowing paragraph. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. If foreclosure is believed to be probable or repayment is\nexpected from the sale of collateral, a reserve for deficiency is established within the ACL. Those reserves are estimated based on the difference between loan\nprincipal and the estimated fair value of the collateral, adjusted for estimated disposition costs.\nExcept for SBLOC, IBLOC and other loans as noted above, for purposes of determining the quantitative historical loss reserve for each similar risk pool, the\nloans not assigned an individual reserve are segregated by product type, to recognize differing risk characteristics within portfolio segments, and an average\nhistorical loss rate is calculated for each product type. Loss rates are computed by classifying net charge-offs by year of loan origination and dividing into total\noriginations for that specific year. This methodology is referred to as vintage analysis. The average loss rate is then projected over the estimated remaining loan\nlives unique to each loan pool, to determine estimated lifetime losses. For SBLOC and IBLOC, since de minimus losses have been incurred, probability of\ndefault/loss given default considerations are utilized. For the other loan category discounted cash flow is utilized to determine a reserve. The Company also\nconsiders the need for an additional ACL based upon qualitative factors such as current loan performance statistics by pool, and economic conditions. These\nqualitative factors are intended to account for forward looking expectations over a twelve to eighteen month period not reflected in historical loss rates and\notherwise unaccounted for in the quantitative process. Accordingly, such factors may increase or decrease the allowance compared to historical loss rates as the\nCompany’s forward-looking expectations change. The qualitative factor percentages are applied against the pool balances as of the end of the period. Aside\nfrom the qualitative adjustments to account for forward looking expectations of loss over a twelve to eighteen month projection period, the balance of the ACL\nreverts to the Company’s quantitative analysis derived from its historical loss rates. The qualitative and quantitative historical loss rate components, together\nwith the allowances on specific credit-deteriorated loans, comprise the total ACL.\nA similar process is employed to calculate an ACL assigned to off-balance sheet commitments, which are comprised of unfunded loan commitments and letters\nof credit. That ACL for unfunded commitments is recorded in other liabilities. Even though portions of the ACL may be allocated to loans that have been\nindividually measured for credit deterioration, the entire ACL is available for any credit that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off.\nAt June 30, 2024, the ACL amounted to $28.6 million of which $11.4 million of allowances resulted from the Company’s historical charge-off ratios, $3.4\nmillion from reserves on specific loans, with the balance comprised of the qualitative components. The $11.4 million resulted primarily from SBA non-real\nestate lending and leasing charge-offs. The proportion of qualitative reserves compared to charge-off history related reserves reflects the general absence of\ncharge-offs in the Company’s largest loan portfolios consisting of SBLOC and IBLOC and real estate bridge lending which results, at least in part, from the\nnature of related collateral. Such collateral respectively consists of marketable securities, the cash value of life insurance and workforce apartment buildings. As\ncharge-offs are nonetheless possible, significant subjectivity is required to consider qualitative factors to derive the related components of the allowance.\nThe Company ranks its qualitative factors in five levels: minimal, low, moderate, moderate-high, and high-risk. The individual qualitative factors for each\nportfolio segment have their own scale based on an analysis of that segment. A high-risk ranking results in the largest increase in the ACL calculation with each\nlevel below having a lesser impact on a sliding scale. The qualitative factors used for each portfolio are described below in the description of each portfolio\nsegment. As a result of continuing economic uncertainty in 2022, including heightened inflation and increased risks of recession, the qualitative factors which\nhad previously been set in anticipation of a downturn, were maintained through the third quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, as risks of a recession\nincreased, the economic qualitative risk factor was increased for non-real estate SBL and leasing. Those higher qualitative allocations were retained in the first\nquarter of 2023, as negative economic indications persisted. In the second quarter of 2023, CECL model adjustments of $1.7 million resulted from a $2.5\nmillion CECL model decrease from changes in estimated average lives, partially offset by a $794,000 CECL model increase resulting from increasing economic\nand collateral risk factors to respective moderate-high and moderate risk levels. The elevated economic risk level for leasing reflected input from department\nheads regarding the potential borrower impact of the higher rate environment. The elevated collateral risk level for leasing reflected lower auction prices for\nvehicles and uncertainty over the extent\n19\nto which such prices might decrease in the future. The adjustment for average lives reflected a change in the estimated lives of leases, higher variances for\nwhich may result from their short maturities. In the third quarter of 2023, there were indications of auction price stabilization, while the auto workers’ strike\ncould reduce supply and drive up prices. Nonetheless, the elevated risk levels were maintained. In the second quarter of 2024, the provision for credit losses\nwas reduced by $1.4 million to reflect reduced average lives for small business non-real estate loans.\nThe Company has not increased the qualitative risk levels for SBLOC or IBLOC because of the nature of related collateral. SBLOC loans are subject to\nmaximum loan to marketable securities value, and notwithstanding historic drops in the stock market in recent years, losses have not been realized. IBLOC\nloans are limited to borrowers with insurance companies that exceed credit requirements, and loan amounts are limited to life insurance cash values. The\nCompany had not, prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, increased the economic factor for multifamily real estate bridge lending. While Federal Reserve rate\nincreases directly increase real estate bridge loan floating-rate borrowing costs, those borrowers are required to purchase interest rate caps that will partially\nlimit the increase in borrowing costs during the term of the loan. Additionally, there continues to be several additional mitigating factors within the multifamily\nsector that should continue to fuel demand. Higher interest rates are increasing the cost to purchase a home, which in turn is increasing the number of renters\nand subsequent demand for multifamily. The softening demand for new homes should continue to exacerbate the current housing shortage, and therefore\ncontinue to fuel demand for multifamily apartment homes. Additionally, higher rents in the multifamily sector are causing renters to be more price sensitive,\nwhich is driving demand for most of the apartment buildings within the Company’s loan portfolio which management considers “workforce” housing. In the\nfourth quarter of 2023, an increasing trend in substandard loans was reflected in an increase in the risk level for the REBL ACL economic qualitative factor,\nwhich resulted in a $1.0 million increase in the fourth quarter provision for credit loss on loans.\nThe economic qualitative factor is based on the estimated impact of economic conditions on the loan pools, as distinguished from the economic factors\nthemselves, for the following reasons. The Company has experienced limited multifamily (apartment building) loan charge-offs, despite stressed economic\nconditions. Accordingly, the ACL for this pool was derived from a qualitative factor based on industry loss information for multifamily housing. The\nCompany’s charge-offs have been virtually non-existent for SBLOC and IBLOC notwithstanding stressed economic periods, and their ACL is accordingly also\ndetermined by a qualitative factor. Investment advisor loans were first offered in 2020 with limited performance history, during which charge-offs have not been\nexperienced. For investment advisor loans, the nature of the underlying ultimate repayment source was considered, namely the fee-based advisory income\nstreams resulting from investment portfolios under management, and the impact changes in economic conditions would have on those payment streams. The\nqualitative factors used for this and the other portfolios are described below in the description of each portfolio segment. Additionally, the Company’s charge-\noff histories for SBLs, primarily SBA, and leases have not correlated with economic conditions, including trends in unemployment. While specific economic\nfactors did not correlate with actual historical losses, multiple economic factors are considered in the economic qualitative factor. For the non-guaranteed\nportion of SBA loans, leases, real estate bridge lending and investment advisor financing, the Company’s loss forecasting analysis included a review of industry\nstatistics. However, the Company’s own charge-off history and average life estimates, for categories in which the Company has experienced charge-offs, was\nthe primary quantitatively derived element in the forecasts. The qualitative component results from management’s qualitative assessments which consider\ninternal and external inputs.\n20\nBelow are the portfolio segments used to pool loans with similar risk characteristics and align with the Company’s methodology for measuring expected credit\nlosses. These pools have similar risk and collateral characteristics, and certain of these pools are broken down further in determining and applying the vintage\nloss estimates previously discussed. For instance, within the direct lease financing pool, government and public institution leases are considered separately.\nAdditionally, the Company evaluates its loans under an internal loan risk rating system as a means of identifying problem loans. The special mention\nclassification indicates weaknesses that may, if not cured, threaten the borrower’s future repayment ability. A substandard classification reflects an existing\nweakness indicating the possible inadequacy of net worth and other repayment sources.

Substantially all SBLs consist of SBA loans. The Bank participates in loan programs established by the SBA, including the 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program\n(the “7(a) Program”), the 504 Fixed Asset Financing Program (the “504 Program”), and the discontinued PPP. The 7(a) Program is designed to help small\nbusiness borrowers start or expand their businesses by providing partial guarantees of loans made by banks and non-bank lending institutions for specific\nbusiness purposes, including long or short term working capital; funds for the purchase of equipment, machinery, supplies and materials; funds for the purchase,\nconstruction or renovation of real estate; and funds to acquire, operate or expand an existing business or refinance existing debt, all under conditions established\nby the SBA. The 504 Program includes the financing of real estate and commercial mortgages. In 2020 and 2021, the Company also participated in the PPP,\nwhich provided short-term loans to small businesses. PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. This program was a specific response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and the vast majority of these loans have been reimbursed by the U.S. government, with $1.8 million remaining to be reimbursed as of\nJune 30, 2024. The Company segments the SBL portfolio into four pools: non-real estate, commercial mortgage and construction to capture the risk\ncharacteristics of each pool, and the PPP loans discussed above. PPP loans are not included in the risk pools because they have inherently different risk\ncharacteristics due to the U.S. government guarantee. In the table above, the PPP loans are included in non-rated SBL non-real estate. The qualitative factors for\nSBL loans focus on pool loan performance, underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans and changes in economic conditions. Additionally, the\nconstruction segment adds a qualitative factor for general construction risk, such as construction delays resulting from labor shortages or availability/pricing of\nconstruction materials.\n24\nDirect lease financing. The Company provides lease financing for commercial and government vehicle fleets and, to a lesser extent, provides lease financing for\nother equipment. Leases are either open-end or closed-end. An open-end lease is one in which, at the end of the lease term, the lessee must pay the difference\nbetween the amount at which the Company sells the leased asset and the stated termination value. Termination value is a contractual value agreed to by the\nparties at the inception of a lease as to the value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term. A closed-end lease is one for which no such payment is due on\nlease termination. In a closed-end lease, the risk that the amount received on a sale of the leased asset will be less than the residual value is assumed by the\nBank, as lessor. The qualitative factors for direct lease financing focus on underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, portfolio loan performance, loan\nconcentrations and changes in economic conditions.\nSBLOC. SBLOC loans are made to individuals, trusts and entities and are secured by a pledge of marketable securities maintained in one or more accounts for\nwhich the Company obtains a securities account control agreement. The securities pledged may be either debt or equity securities or a combination thereof, but\nall such securities must be listed for trading on a national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. SBLOCs are typically payable on\ndemand. Maximum SBLOC line amounts are calculated by applying a standard “advance rate” calculation against the eligible security type depending on asset\nclass: typically, up to 50% for equity securities and mutual fund securities and 80% for investment grade (Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB- or higher, or\nMoody’s rating of Baa3 or higher) municipal or corporate debt securities. Substantially all SBLOCs have full recourse to the borrower. The underlying\nsecurities collateral for SBLOC loans is monitored on a daily basis to confirm the composition of the client portfolio and its daily market value. The primary\nqualitative factor in the SBLOC analysis is the ratio of loans outstanding to market value. This factor has been maintained at low levels, which has remained\nappropriate as losses have not materialized despite the historic declines in the equity markets during 2020, during which there were no losses. Significant losses\nhave not been incurred since inception of this line of business. Additionally, the advance rates noted above were established to provide the Company with\nprotection from declines in market conditions from the origination date of the lines of credit.\nIBLOC. IBLOC loans are collateralized by the cash surrender value of eligible insurance policies. Should a loan default, the primary risks for IBLOCs are if\nthe insurance company issuing the policy were to become insolvent, or if that company would fail to recognize the Bank’s assignment of policy proceeds. To\nmitigate these risks, insurance company ratings are periodically evaluated for compliance with Bank standards. Additionally, the Bank utilizes assignments of\ncash surrender value, which legal counsel has concluded are enforceable. Significant losses have not been incurred since inception of this line of business. The\nqualitative factors for IBLOC primarily focus on the concentration risk with insurance companies.\nInvestment advisor financing. In 2020, the Bank began originating loans to investment advisors for purposes of debt refinancing, acquisition of another firm or\ninternal succession. Maximum loan amounts are subject to loan-to-value ratios of 70%, based on third-party business appraisals, but may be increased\ndepending upon the debt service coverage ratio. Personal guarantees and blanket business liens are obtained as appropriate. Loan repayment is highly dependent\non fee streams from advisor clientele. Accordingly, loss of fee-based investment advisory clients or negative market performance may reduce fees and pose a\nrisk to these credits. As credit losses have not been experienced, the ACL is determined by qualitative factors. The qualitative factors for investment advisor\nfinancing focus on historical industry losses, changes in lending policies and procedures, portfolio performance and economic conditions.\nReal estate bridge loans. Real estate bridge loans are transitional commercial mortgage loans which are made to improve and rehabilitate existing properties\nwhich already have cash flow, and which are securitized by those properties. Prior to 2020, such loans were originated for securitization and loans which had\nbeen originated but not securitized continue to be accounted for at fair value in “Commercial loans, at fair value”, on the balance sheet. In 2021, originations\nresumed and are being held for investment in “Loans, net of deferred fees and costs”, on the balance sheet. The Bancorp has minimal exposure to non-\nmultifamily commercial real estate such as office buildings, and instead has a portfolio largely comprised of rehabilitation bridge loans for apartment buildings.\nThese loans generally have three-year terms with two one-year extensions to allow for the rehabilitation work to be completed and rentals stabilized for an\nextended period, before being refinanced at lower rates through U.S. Government Sponsored Entities or other lenders. The rehabilitation real estate lending\nportfolio consists primarily of workforce housing, which the Company considers to be working class apartments at more affordable rental rates. As charge-offs\nhave generally not been experienced for multifamily (apartment building loans) which comprise the REBL portfolio, the ACL is determined by qualitative\nfactors. Qualitative factors focus on historical industry losses, changes in economic conditions, underlying collateral and portfolio performance.\nConsumer fintech loans. Consumer fintech loans consists primarily of secured credit card loans. The majority of the balances were collateralized with deposits\nat the Bank, with related income statement impact reflected both in a lower cost of funds and fee income. The lower cost of funds results from balances required\nto be maintained to collateralize related card use. Related fee income is reflected in the “ Prepaid, debit card and related fees” line of the income statement.\nOther loans. Other loans include commercial and home equity lines of credit which the Company generally no longer offers. Qualitative factors focus on\nchanges in the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, portfolio loan performance, loan concentrations and changes in economic conditions.\n25\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the estimated remaining lives of loans. The estimate excludes possible extensions, renewals and modifications unless\neither of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation that a loan will be restructured, or the extension or renewal options are included in the\nborrower contract and are not unconditionally cancellable by us.\nThe Company does not measure an ACL on accrued interest receivable balances, because these balances are written off in a timely manner as a reduction to\ninterest income when loans are placed on non-accrual status.\nACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to\ncredit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The ACL on such off-balance\nsheet credit exposures, also referred to as loan commitments, is adjusted through the provision for credit losses. The estimate considers the likelihood that\nfunding will occur over the estimated life of the commitment. The amount of the ACL on such exposures as of June 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023 was\n$2.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively.\nA detail of the changes in the ACL by loan category and summary of loans evaluated individually and collectively for credit deterioration is as follows (in\nthousands):\nJ un e 30, 2024\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor Real

(3,461)\nThe Company did not have loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality at either June 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. In the first six months of 2024, the\nCompany purchased $16.4 million of SBLs, none of which were credit deteriorated. Additionally, in the first six months of 2024, the Company participated in\nSBLs with other institutions in the amount of $6.2 million.\nThe non-accrual loans in the following table are treated as collateral dependent to the extent they have resulted from borrower financial difficulty (and not from\nadministrative delays or other mitigating factors), and are not brought current. For non-accrual loans, the Company establishes a reserve in the allowance for\ncredit losses for deficiencies between estimated collateral and loan carrying values. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company did not have any\nsignificant changes to the extent to which collateral secures its collateral dependent loans due to general collateral deterioration or from other factors. SBL non-\nreal estate are collateralized by business assets, which may include certain real estate. SBL commercial mortgage and construction are collateralized by real\nestate for small businesses, while real estate bridge lending is primarily collateralized by apartment buildings, or other commercial real estate. SBLOC is\ncollateralized by marketable investment securities while IBLOC is collateralized by the cash value of life insurance. Advisor financing is collateralized by\ninvestment advisors’ business franchises. Direct lease financing is collateralized primarily by vehicles, or equipment.\n29\nA detail of the Company’s delinquent loans by loan category is as follows (in thousands):\nJ une 30, 2024\n30-59 days 60-89 days 90+ days Total Total\npast due past due still accruing Non-accrual past due Current loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 78 $ 311 $ 764 $ 2,448 $ 3,601 $ 168,292 $ 171,893\nSBL commercial mortgage — 336 — 5,211 5,547 642,347 647,894\nSBL construction — — — 3,385 3,385 27,496 30,881\nDirect lease financing 4,575 4,415 2,224 3,870 15,084 696,319 711,403\nSBLOC / IBLOC 12,448 2,101 1,284 — 15,833 1,542,262 1,558,095\nAdvisor financing — — — — — 238,831 238,831\nReal estate bridge loans(1) — 12,300 — — 12,300 2,107,024 2,119,324\nConsumer fintech — — — — — 70,081 70,081\nOther loans 96 — 4 — 100 46,492 46,592\nUnamortized loan fees and costs — — — — — 10,733 10,733\n$ 17,197 $ 19,463 $ 4,276 $ 14,914 $ 55,850 $ 5,549,877 $ 5,605,727\nD ec ember 31, 2023\n30-59 days 60-89 days 90+ days Total Total\npast due past due still accruing Non-accrual past due Current loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 84 $ 333 $ 336 $ 1,842 $ 2,595 $ 135,157 $ 137,752\nSBL commercial mortgage 2,183 — — 2,381 4,564 602,422 606,986\nSBL construction — — — 3,385 3,385 19,242 22,627\nDirect lease financing 5,163 1,209 485 3,785 10,642 675,015 685,657\nSBLOC / IBLOC 21,934 3,607 745 — 26,286 1,600,999 1,627,285\nAdvisor financing — — — — — 221,612 221,612\nReal estate bridge loans — — — — — 1,999,782 1,999,782\nConsumer fintech — — — — — — —\nOther loans 853 76 178 132 1,239 49,399 50,638\nUnamortized loan fees and costs — — — — — 8,800 8,800\n$ 30,217 $ 5,225 $ 1,744 $ 11,525 $ 48,711 $ 5,312,428 $ 5,361,139\n(1) Borrowers for a $12.3 million apartment property real estate bridge loan which had a six month payment deferral granted in the fourth quarter of 2023 have not resumed payments and are reflected\nin the 60-89 days past due column in the table above. The related “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs based on a May 2024 appraisal were 72% and 56%, respectively. The “as stabilized” loan to value\nmeasures the apartment property’s value after renovations have been completed and units have generally been released. The Company originated a new loan with a new borrower for a previously\nreported $9.5 million REBL loan that was 60 to 89 days delinquent at March 31, 2024. The new borrower is expected to have greater financial capacity to complete the related project and has\nnegotiated three quarters of payment deferrals and a lower rate. The “as stabilized” LTV is approximately 78% after considering additional estimated future fundings to complete renovations. The\naforementioned LTVs are based on third party appraisals performed within the past year.\nThe scheduled maturities of the direct financing leases reconciled to the total lease receivables in the consolidated balance sheet, are as follows (in thousands):\nRemaining 2024 $ 120,604\n2025 181,416\n2026 157,354\n2027 84,617\n2028 40,342\n2029 and thereafter 9,067\nTotal undiscounted cash flows 593,400\nResidual value(1) 219,386\nDifference between undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows (101,383)\nPresent value of lease payments recorded as lease receivables $ 711,403\n(1) Of the $219,386,000, $48,259,000 is not guaranteed by the lessee or other guarantors.\nNote 7. Transactions with Affiliates\nThe Bank did not maintain any deposits for various affiliated companies as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Bank has entered into lending transactions in the ordinary course of business with directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliates of such\npersons. All loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with\npersons not related to the lender. At June 30, 2024, these loans were current as to principal and interest payments and did not involve more than normal risk of\ncollectability. Loans to these related parties amounted to $5.8 million at June 30, 2024 and $5.7 million at December 31, 2023.\nMr. Hersh Kozlov, a director of the Company, is a partner at Duane Morris LLP, an international law firm. The Company paid Duane Morris LLP $4,800 and\n$2,800 for legal services for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n30\nNote 8. Fair Value Measurements\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of an entity’s assets and liabilities considered to be financial instruments. For\nthe Company, as for most financial institutions, the majority of its assets and liabilities are considered to be financial instruments. However, many such\ninstruments lack an available trading market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange transaction. Accordingly, estimated\nfair values are determined by the Company using the best available data and an estimation methodology it believes to be suitable for each category of financial\ninstruments. Also, it is the Company’s general practice and intent to hold its financial instruments to maturity whether or not categorized as available-for-sale\nand not to engage in trading or sales activities although it has sold loans and securities in the past and may do so in the future. For fair value disclosure\npurposes, the Company utilized certain value measurement criteria required in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC\n820”), as discussed below. In addition, ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to assets and liabilities. It clarifies that fair value is\nan exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants\nat the measurement date. It also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures concerning fair value measurements. ASC 820\nestablishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3\nmeasurements). Level 1 valuation is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities to which the Company has access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 valuation is based on other observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. This includes quoted prices for similar assets in active\nor inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks,\ndefault rates, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated through, observable market data by market-corroborated reports. Level 3 valuation is\nbased on “unobservable inputs” which the Company believes is the best information available in the circumstances. A financial instrument’s level within the fair\nvalue hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nChanges in the assumptions or methodologies used to estimate fair values may materially affect the estimated amounts. Also, there may not be reasonable\ncomparability between institutions due to the wide range of permitted assumptions and methodologies in the absence of active markets. This lack of uniformity\ngives rise to a high degree of subjectivity in estimating financial instrument fair values.\nCash and cash equivalents, which are comprised of cash and due from banks and the Company’s balance at the Federal Reserve Bank, had recorded values of\n$405.6 million and $1.04 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which approximated fair values.\nThe estimated fair values of investment securities are based on quoted market prices, if available, or estimated independently by a third-party pricing service\nbased upon their matrix pricing technique. Level 3 investment security fair values are based on the present valuing of cash flows, which discounts expected cash\nflows from principal and interest using yield to maturity, or yield to call as appropriate, at the measurement date. In the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, there\nwere no transfers between the three levels.\nFederal Reserve, FHLB, and ACBB stock, are held as required by those respective institutions and are carried at cost. Each of these institutions require their\nmembers to hold stock as a condition of membership. While a fixed stock amount is required by each of these institutions, the FHLB stock requirement\nperiodically increases or decreases with varying levels of borrowing activity.\nCommercial loans held at fair value are comprised primarily of commercial real estate bridge loans and SBA loans which had been originated for sale or\nsecuritization in the secondary market, and which are now being held on the balance sheet. Commercial real estate bridge loans and SBA loans are valued using\na discounted cash flow analysis based upon pricing for similar loans where market indications of the sales price of such loans are not available. SBA loans are\nvalued on a pooled basis and commercial real estate bridge loans are valued individually.\nLoans, net have an estimated fair value using the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate used in these calculations is the estimated current market\nrate adjusted for credit risk. Accrued interest receivable has a carrying value that approximates fair value.\nLoan fair values are based on “unobservable inputs” that are based on available information. Level 3 fair values are based on the present value of cash flows by\nunit of measurement.\nFor OREO, market value is based upon appraisals of the underlying collateral by third-party appraisers, reduced by 7% to 10% for estimated selling costs.\nThe estimated fair values of demand deposits (comprised of interest and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and certain types of money\nmarket accounts) are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (generally, their carrying amounts). The fair values of securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase and short-term borrowings, when outstanding, are equal to their carrying amounts as they are short-term borrowings.\n31\nTime deposits, when outstanding, senior debt and subordinated debentures have a fair value estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies\ncurrent interest rates to discount expected cash flows. The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value. Long term borrowings\nresulting from sold loans which did not qualify for true sale accounting are presented in the amount of the principal of such loans.\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps, recorded in other assets or other liabilities, are determined using models that use readily observable market inputs and a\nmarket standard methodology applied to the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and interest rate indices.\nThe fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated based on the amount of unamortized deferred loan commitment fees. The fair value of letters of\ncredit is based on the amount of unearned fees plus the estimated cost to terminate the letters of credit. Fair values of unrecognized financial instruments,\nincluding commitments to extend credit, and the fair value of letters of credit are considered immaterial.\nThe following tables provide information

sheet date, are subject to judgments, assumptions and uncertainties, changes in which could\nhave a significant impact on such valuations. Weighted averages were calculated by using the discount rate for each individual security or loan weighted by its\nmarket value, except for SBA loans. For SBA loans, the yield derived from market pricing indications for comparable pools determined by date of loan\norigination. For commercial loans recorded at fair value, changes in fair value are reflected in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of securities\nwhich are unrelated to credit are recorded through equity. Changes in the fair value of loans recorded at amortized cost which are unrelated to credit are a\ndisclosure item, without impact on the financial statements. The notes below refer to the June 30, 2024 table.\n(1) Commercial mortgage-backed investment security, consisting of a single bank-issued CRE security, is valued using discounted cash flow analysis. The\ndiscount rate and prepayment rate applied are based upon market observations and actual experience for comparable securities and implicitly assume market\naverages for defaults and loss severities. The CRE-2 security has significant credit enhancement, or protection from other subordinated tranches in the issue,\nwhich limits the valuation exposure to credit losses. Nonetheless, increases in expected default rates or loss severities on the loans underlying the issue could\nreduce its value. In market environments in which investors demand greater yield compensation for credit risk, the discount rate applied would ordinarily be\nhigher and the valuation lower. Changes in loss experience could also change the interest earned on this holding in future periods and impact its fair value. As a\nsingle security, the weighted average rate shown is the actual rate applied to the CRE-2 security. For additional information related to this security, which was\ntransferred to nonaccrual status in the second quarter of 2024, see “Note 6. Loans.”\n34\n(2) Loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs are valued using discounted cash flow analysis. Discount rates are based upon available information for estimated\ncurrent origination rates for each loan type. Origination rates may fluctuate based upon changes in the risk free (Treasury) rate and credit experience for each\nloan type.\n(3) Commercial – SBA Loans are comprised of the government guaranteed portion of SBA-insured loans. Their valuation is based upon the yield derived from\ndealer pricing indications for guaranteed pools, adjusted for seasoning and prepayments. A limited number of broker-dealers originate the pooled securities for\nwhich the loans are purchased and as a result, prices can fluctuate based on such limited market demand, although the government guarantee has resulted in\nconsistent historical demand. Valuations are impacted by prepayment assumptions resulting from both voluntary payoffs and defaults. Such assumptions for\nthese seasoned loans are based on a seasoning vector for constant prepayment rates from 3% to 30% over life.\n(4) Non-SBA commercial real estate – fixed are fixed rate non-SBA commercial real estate mortgages. These loans are fair valued by a third-party, based upon\ndiscounting at market rates for similar loans. Discount rates used in applying discounted cash flow analysis utilize input based upon loan terms, the general\nlevel of interest rates and the quality of the credit. Deterioration in loan performance or other credit weaknesses could result in fair value ranges which would be\ndependent upon potential buyers’ tolerance for such weaknesses and are difficult to estimate.\n(5) Non-SBA commercial real estate – floating are floating rate non-SBA loans, the majority of which are secured by multifamily properties (apartments). These\nare bridge loans designed to provide owners time and funding for property improvements and are generally valued using discounted cash flow analysis. The\ndiscount rate for the vast majority of these loans was based upon current origination rates for similar loans. Deterioration in loan performance or other credit\nweaknesses could result in fair value ranges which would be dependent upon potential buyers’ tolerance for such weaknesses and are difficult to estimate. At\nJune 30, 2024, these loans were fair valued by a third-party, based upon discounting at market rates for similar loans.\n(6) Subordinated debentures are comprised of $13.4 million of debentures bearing interest at SOFR plus 3.51% and maturing in March 2038 (the “2038\nDebentures”), which are valued using discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rate is based on the market rate for comparable relatively illiquid\ninstruments. Changes in those market rates, or the credit of the Company could result in changes in the 2038 Debentures’ valuation.\n(7) For OREO, fair value is based upon appraisals of the underlying collateral by third-party appraisers, reduced by 7% to 10% for estimated selling costs. Such\nappraisals reflect estimates of amounts realizable upon property sales based on the sale of comparable properties and other factors. Actual sales prices may vary\nbased upon the identification of potential purchasers, changing conditions in local real estate markets and the level of interest rates required to finance\npurchases.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, segregated by fair value hierarchy, during the periods shown are summarized below (in thousands). The\nnon-accrual loans in the following table are treated as collateral dependent to the extent they have resulted from borrower financial difficulty (and not from\nadministrative delays or other mitigating factors), and are not brought current. For non-accrual loans, the Company establishes a reserve in the allowance for\ncredit losses for deficiencies between estimated collateral and loan carrying values.\nFair Valu e M e a surements at Reporting D ate Us ing\nQuoted prices in active Significant other Significant\nmarkets for identical observable unobservable\nFair value assets inputs inputs(1)\nDescription June 30, 2024 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCollateral dependent loans with specific reserves(1) $ 6,643 $ — $ — $ 6,643\nOREO 57,861 — — 57,861\n$ 64,504 $ — $ — $ 64,504\nFair Valu e M ea surements at Reporting D ate Us ing\nQuoted prices in active Significant other Significant\nmarkets for identical observable unobservable\nFair value assets inputs inputs(1)\nDescription December 31, 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCollateral dependent loans with specific reserves(1) $ 8,944 $ — $ — $ 8,944\nOREO 16,949 — — 16,949\n$ 25,893 $ — $ — $ 25,893\n(1) The method of valuation approach for the loans evaluated for an allowance for credit losses on an individual loan basis and also for OREO was the market approach based upon appraisals of the\nunderlying collateral by external appraisers, reduced by 7% to 10% for estimated selling costs.\nAt June 30, 2024, principal on collateral dependent loans, which is accounted for on the basis of the value of underlying collateral, is shown at an estimated fair\nvalue of $6.6 million. To arrive at that fair value, related loan principal of $10.0 million was reduced by specific reserves of $3.4 million within the ACL as of\nthat date, representing the deficiency between principal and estimated collateral\n35\nvalues, which were reduced by estimated costs to sell. When the deficiency is deemed uncollectible, it is charged off by reducing the specific reserve and\ndecreasing principal. Valuation techniques consistent with the market and/or cost approach were used to measure fair value and primarily included observable\ninputs for the individual loans being evaluated such as recent sales of similar collateral or observable market data for operational or carrying costs. In cases\nwhere such inputs were unobservable, the loan balance is reflected within the Level 3 hierarchy.\nNote 9. Other Identifiable Intangible Assets\nIn May 2016, the Company purchased approximately $60.0 million of lease receivables which resulted in a customer list intangible of $3.4 million that is being\namortized over a ten year period. Amortization expense is $340,000 per year ($624,000 over the next three years). The gross carrying amount of the customer\nlist intangible is $3.4 million, and as of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, the accumulated amortization expense was $2.8 million and\n$2.6 million.\nIn January 2020, the Company purchased McMahon Leasing and subsidiaries for approximately $8.7 million which resulted in $1.1 million of intangibles. The\ngross carrying value of $1.1 million of intangibles was comprised of a customer list intangible of $689,000, goodwill of $263,000 and a trade name valuation of\n$135,000. The customer list intangible is being amortized over a twelve year period and accumulated amortization expense was $258,000 at June 30, 2024 and\n$230,000 at December 31, 2023. Amortization expense is $57,000 per year ($287,000 over the next five years).

Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. ASU\n2022-02 addresses areas identified by the FASB as part of its post-implementation review of the credit losses standard (ASU 2016-13) that introduced the\nCECL model. The amendments eliminate the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted the CECL model and enhance\nthe disclosure requirements for loan refinancings and modifications. The Company adopted ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023. Effective January 1, 2023, loan\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are required to be disclosed by type of modification and by type of loan. Prior accounting guidance\nclassified loans which were modified as troubled debt restructurings only if the modification reflected a concession from the lender in the form of a below\nmarket interest rate or other concession in addition to borrower financial difficulty.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\nASU 2023-07 enhances segment level disclosures, for both annual and quarterly reporting periods and is effective with the December 31, 2024 financial\nstatements. As a result of the enhancements, segment disclosures will include greater detail surrounding the nature of expenses now reported as a single line\nitem in the segment income statements. In addition to disclosing the chief operational decision maker by title and position, an explanation of how the segment\ninformation is used by that decision maker will be summarized. The Company is currently evaluating these new disclosure enhancements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09, effective January 1,\n2025, adds annual disclosures for the amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, shown separately for federal, state and foreign taxes. Total tax paid, net of\nrefunds, for any jurisdictions which exceed 5% of total net taxes paid, will also be shown separately. The Company is currently evaluating these disclosures.\nNote 11. Shareholders’ Equity\nOn October 20, 2021, the Board approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2022 fiscal year (the “2022 Repurchase Program”). Under the 2022\nRepurchase Program, the Company repurchased $15.0 million in value of the Company’s common stock in each quarter of 2022.\n36\nOn October 26, 2022, the Board approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2023 fiscal year (the “2023 Repurchase Program”). Under the 2023\nRepurchase Program, the Company repurchased $25.0 million in value of the Company’s common stock in each quarter of 2023.\nOn October 26, 2023, the Board approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2024 fiscal year (the “2024 Repurchase Program”), which authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase $50.0 million in value of the Company’s common stock per fiscal quarter in 2024, for a maximum amount of $200.0 million. The\nCompany increased its share repurchase authorization for the second quarter of 2024 from $50.0 million to $100.0 million, which increased the maximum\namount under the 2024 Repurchase Program to $250.0 million. Under the 2024 Repurchase Program, the Company intends to repurchase shares through open\nmarket purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The 2024 Repurchase Program may be modified or terminated at any time. During\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 3,018,405 shares and 4,280,617 shares of its common stock in the open market under\nthe 2024 Repurchase Program at an average price of $33.13 per share and $35.04 per share, respectively.\nAs a means of returning capital to shareholders, the Company implemented stock repurchase programs which totaled $40.0 million, $60.0 million and $100.0\nmillion, in equal quarterly amounts, respectively, in 2021, 2022 and 2023, with $200 million originally planned for 2024. Subsequently the second quarter 2024\nplanned repurchase was increased from $50 million to $100 million, with $50 million in repurchases planned for each remaining quarter of 2024. The planned\namounts of such repurchases are generally determined in the fourth quarter of the preceding year by assessing the impact of budgetary earnings projections on\nregulatory capital requirements. The excess of projected earnings over amounts required to maintain capital requirements is the maximum available for capital\nreturn to shareholders, barring any need to retain capital for other purposes. A significant portion of such excess earnings has been utilized for stock repurchases\nin the amounts noted above, while cash dividends have not been paid. In determining whether capital is returned through stock repurchases or cash dividends,\nthe Company calculates a maximum share repurchase price, based upon comparisons with what it concludes to be other exemplar peer share price valuations,\nwith further consideration of internal growth projections. As these share prices, which are updated at least annually, have not been reached, capital return has\nconsisted solely of stock repurchases. Exemplar share price comparisons are based upon multiples of earnings per share over time, with further consideration of\nreturns on equity and assets. While repurchase amounts are planned in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, repurchases may be modified or terminated at\nany time, should capital need to be conserved.\nNote 12. Regulatory Matters\nIt is the policy of the Federal Reserve that financial holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past\nyear and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that a\nfinancial holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the financial holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength\nto its banking subsidiaries.\nVarious federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory\napproval. Without the prior approval of the OCC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of\nthe current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Additionally, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s\nretained earnings. Moreover, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than “adequately capitalized”\nunder the prompt corrective action framework as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment\ndue to the FDIC. Similarly, a banking organization that fails to satisfy regulatory minimum capital conservation buffer requirements will be subject to certain\nlimitations, which include restrictions on capital distributions(cid:0)(cid:17)\nIn addition to these explicit limitations, federal and state regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or financial holding company from\nengaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an\nunsafe or unsound banking practice.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum\ncapital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material\neffect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the\nCompany and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as\ncalculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification of the Company and the Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments\nby the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Moreover, capital requirements may be modified based upon regulatory rules or by\nregulatory discretion at any time reflecting a variety of factors including deterioration in asset quality.\n37\nThe following table sets forth our regulatory capital amounts and ratios for the periods indicated:\n(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) Tier 1 capital (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) Tier 1 capital (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) Total capital (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) Common equity\nto average to risk-weighted to risk-weighted tier 1 to risk\nassets ratio assets ratio assets ratio weighted assets\nAs of June 30, 2024\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 10.07% 14.13% 14.68% 14.13%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 11.21% 15.69% 16.24% 15.69%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\nAs of December 31, 2023\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 11.19% 15.66% 16.23% 15.66%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 12.37% 17.35% 17.92% 17.35%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\nNote 13. Legal\nOn June 12, 2019, the Bank was served with a qui tam lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, New Castle County. The Delaware\nDepartment of Justice intervened in the litigation. The case is titled The State of Delaware, Plaintiff, Ex rel. Russell S. Rogers, Plaintiff-Relator v. The Bancorp\nBank, Interactive Communications International, Inc., and InComm Financial Services, Inc., Defendants. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants violated the\nDelaware False Claims Act by not paying balances on certain open-loop “Vanilla” prepaid cards to the State of Delaware as unclaimed property. The complaint\nseeks actual and treble damages, statutory penalties, and attorneys’ fees. The Bank has filed an answer denying the allegations and continues to vigorously\ndefend against the claims. The Bank and other defendants previously filed a motion to dismiss the action, but the motion was denied and the case is in\npreliminary stages of discovery. The Company is unable to determine whether the ultimate resolution of the matter will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s financial condition or operations.\nOn September 14, 2021, Cachet Financial Services (“Cachet”) filed an adversary proceeding against the Bank in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central\nDistrict of California, titled Cachet Financial Services, Plaintiff v. The Bancorp Bank, et al., Defendants. The case was filed within the context of Cachet’s\npending Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. The Bank previously served as the Originating Depository Financial Institution (“ODFI”) for automated clearing house\n(“ACH”) transactions in connection with Cachet’s payroll services business. The matter arises from the Bank’s termination of its Payroll Processing ODFI\nAgreement with Cachet on October 23, 2019, for safety and soundness reasons. The initial complaint alleges eight causes of action: (i) breach of contract; (ii)\nnegligence; (iii) intentional interference with contract; (iv) conversion; (v) express indemnity; (vi) implied indemnity; (vii) accounting; and (viii) objection to\nthe Bank’s proof of claim in the bankruptcy case. On November 4, 2021, the Bank filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California\nto withdraw the reference of the adversary proceeding to the bankruptcy court, which was denied in February 2023. On August 3, 2022, Cachet served the Bank\nwith a First Amended Complaint wherein Cachet, among other things, withdraws its implied indemnity claim against the Bank and adds several defendants\nunaffiliated with the Bank and causes of action related to those parties. As to the Bank, Cachet seeks approximately $150 million in damages, an accounting and\ndisallowance of the Bank’s proof of claim. The Bank is vigorously defending against these claims. On September 28, 2022, the Bank filed a partial motion to\ndismiss, seeking to dispose of the majority of Cachet’s claims against the Bank. The motion is still pending before the bankruptcy court. The Company is not\nyet able to determine whether the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial conditions or operations.\nOn March 27, 2023, the Bank received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) seeking documents\nand information related to the Bank’s escheatment practices in connection with certain accounts offered through one of the Bank’s program partners. The Bank\ncontinues to cooperate with the CFPB, including by responding to the CID. While the Company remains confident in the Bank’s escheatment practices, it\ncannot predict the timing or final outcome of the investigation. Future costs related to this matter may be material and could continue to be material at least\nthrough the completion of the investigation.\nOn September 8, 2023, Del Mar TIC I, LLC and Del Mar TIC II, LLC (together, “Del Mar”) filed a complaint against the Bank in the Supreme Court of the\nState of New York, New York County, captioned Del Mar TIC I, LLC and Del Mar TIC II, LLC, Plaintiffs v. The Bancorp Bank, Defendant. The complaint\nalleges, among other things, that the Bank improperly and unreasonably force-placed excessive insurance coverage on real property that serves as security for a\nloan from the Bank to Del Mar, and that the Bank is improperly paying the related insurance premiums from escrow funds. The complaint asserts five causes of\naction: (i) declaratory judgment; (ii) breach of fiduciary duty; (iii) breach of contract: implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (iv) breach of contract:\nescrow account; and (v) injunctive relief. On October 12, 2023, the Bank removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On\nNovember 15, 2023, the Bank filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. Del Mar subsequently filed an amended complaint, but maintained the same causes of\naction. On December 22, 2023, the Bank filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On May 16, 2024, the court granted the Bank’s motion and\ndismissed Del Mar’s amended complaint with prejudice. On June 14, 2024, Del Mar appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nThe parties subsequently resolved the matter without material loss to the Bank and the case was dismissed on or about July 1, 2024. The Company considers\nthis matter resolved.\n38\nOn November 21, 2023, TBBK Card Services, Inc. (“TBBK Card”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, was served with a complaint filed in the Superior\nCourt of the State of California, captioned People of the State of California, acting by and through San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu, Plaintiff v.\nInComm Financial Services, Inc., TBBK Card Services, Inc., Sutton Bank, Pathward, N.A., and Does 1-10, Defendants. The complaint principally alleges that\nthe defendants engaged in unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business acts and practices related to the packaging of “Vanilla” prepaid cards and the refund process\nfor unauthorized transactions that occurred due to card draining practices. On December 14, 2023, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California. On March 26, 2024, the case was remanded to the Superior Court of the State of California. TBBK Card is vigorously\ndefending against the claims. On May 6, 2024, TBBK Card filed a motion to quash service of summons as to TBBK Card for lack of personal jurisdiction,\nwhich is still pending. The Company is not yet able to determine whether the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s financial conditions or operations.\nIn addition, we are a party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Management believes that none of these\nactions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations.\nNote 14. Segment Financials\nThe Company operates under three segments: specialty finance, payments and corporate. The chief operating decision maker for these segments is the Chief\nExecutive Officer. Specialty finance includes the origination of non-SBA commercial real estate loans, SBA loans, direct lease financing, security-backed lines\nof credit, cash value insurance policy-backed lines of credit and deposits generated by those business lines. Payments include prepaid and debit card accounts,\ncard and other payments related accounts, ACH processing and deposits and credit products generated by those business lines. Corporate includes the\nCompany’s investment portfolio, corporate overhead and non-allocated expenses. Effective tax rates are similar for each segment and are not a meaningful\naspect of related segment decisions.\nThe following tables provide segment information for the periods indicated:\nFor the three month s en ded June 30, 2024\nSpecialty finance Payments Corporate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest income $ 113,655 $ — $ 23,644 $ 137,299\nInterest allocation (34,217) 40,102 (5,885) —\nInterest expense 854 38,888 3,762 43,504\nNet interest income 78,584 1,214 13,997 93,795\nProvision for credit losses on loans and unfunded\ncommitments 1,420 — (168) 1,252\nNon-interest income 2,763 27,927 32 30,722\nNon-interest expense 23,150 20,847 7,449 51,446\nIncome before taxes 56,777 8,294 6,748 71,819\nIncome tax expense 14,336 2,094 1,703 18,133\nNet income $ 42,441 $ 6,200 $ 5,045 $ 53,686\nFor the three month s en ded June 30, 2023\nSpecialty finance Payments Corporate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest income $ 106,588 $ 21 $ 19,681 $ 126,290\nInterest allocation (32,323) 35,628 (3,305) —\nInterest expense 1,297 34,663 3,135 39,095\nNet interest income 72,968 986 13,241 87,195\nProvision for credit losses on loans and unfunded\ncommitments 361 — — 361\nNon-interest income 4,358 24,640 338 29,336\nNon-interest expense 21,051 18,691 10,201 49,943\nIncome before taxes 55,914 6,935 3,378 66,227\nIncome tax expense 14,537 1,803 878 17,218\nNet income (loss) $ 41,377 $ 5,132 $ 2,500 $ 49,009\n39\nFor the six months end ed J une 30, 2024\nSpecialty finance Payments Corporate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest income $ 226,276 $ 2 $ 46,830 $ 273,108\nInterest allocation (68,203) 79,680 (11,477) —\nInterest expense 1,711 76,951 6,233 84,895\nNet interest income 156,362 2,731 29,120 188,213\nProvision for credit losses on loans and unfunded\ncommitments 3,591 — (170) 3,421\nNon-interest income 4,460 55,208 436 60,104\nNon-interest expense 45,972 41,041 11,145 98,158\nIncome before taxes 111,259 16,898 18,581 146,738\nIncome tax expense 27,770 4,218 4,635 36,623\nNet income $ 83,489 $ 12,680 $ 13,946 $ 110,115\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023\nSpecialty finance Payments Corporate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest income $ 211,979 $ 40 $ 36,447 $ 248,466\nInterest allocation (65,257) 70,479 (5,222) —\nInterest expense 2,783 65,167 7,505 75,455\nNet interest income 143,939 5,352 23,720 173,011\nProvision for credit losses on loans and unfunded\ncommitments 2,264 — — 2,264\nNon-interest income 7,776 50,168 381 58,325\nNon-interest expense 42,549 37,306 18,118 97,973\nIncome before taxes 106,902 18,214 5,983 131,099\nIncome tax expense 26,883 4,580 1,505 32,968\nNet income (loss) $ 80,019 $ 13,634 $ 4,478 $ 98,131\nJune 30, 2 024\nSpecialty finance Payments Corporate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTotal assets $ 5,741,190 $ 102,031 $ 2,302,180 $ 8,145,401\nTotal liabilities $ 189,462 $ 6,835,282 $ 343,666 $ 7,368,410\nDecemb er 3 1, 20 23\nSpecialty finance Payments Corporate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTotal assets $ 5,682,035 $ 42,769 $ 1,980,891 $ 7,705,695\nTotal liabilities $ 238,042 $ 6,412,911 $ 247,461 $ 6,898,414\nNote 15. Subsequent Events\nThe Company evaluated its June 30, 2024 consolidated financial statements for subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements were\nissued. Pursuant to the 2024 Repurchase Program, described in “Note 11. Shareholders’ Equity,” between July 1, 2024, and July 29, 2024, the Company\nrepurchased 308,380 shares of its common stock, at a total cost of $13.7 million and an average price of $44.48 per share.\n40\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides information about the Company’s\nresults of operations, financial condition, liquidity and asset quality. This information is intended to facilitate your understanding and assessment of significant\nchanges and trends related to our financial condition and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our financial information in our\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”) and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nImportant Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nWhen used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “should,” “will,” “could,” “estimates,”\n“plans” or the negative versions of those words or other comparable words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, as\nsuch term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q except as required by applicable law.\nRecent Developments\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Company’s common stock repurchases amounted to $100.0 million. Shares outstanding at June 30, 2024 amounted to 49.3\nmillion compared to 53.2 million at December 31, 2023, a reduction of 7.4%.\nIn April 2024, the Company purchased U.S. government-sponsored agency fixed rate commercial and residential mortgage securities of varying maturities to\nreduce its exposure to lower levels of net interest income should the Federal Reserve begin decreasing rates. Such purchases will also reduce the additional net\ninterest income which would result should the Federal Reserve increase rates. In April 2024, the Company purchased approximately $900 million of such\nsecurities, with respective estimated weighted average yields and lives of approximately 5.11% and eight years. These purchases and fixed loan originations\nhave significantly reduced net interest income exposure to Federal Reserve changes to interest rates. See “Asset and Liability Management” in this MD&A.\nThe Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for an apartment property acquired by The Bancorp Bank through foreclosure in connection with a\nreal estate bridge lending (“REBL”) loan. At June 30, 2024, the related $39.4 million balance, comprised the majority of our other real estate owned (“OREO”).\nThe purchaser made an earnest money deposit of $125,000 in July 2024, with additional required deposits projected to total $500,000 prior to the December 31,\n2024 closing deadline. The sales price is expected to cover the Company’s current OREO balance plus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property.\nThere can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, it is expected that earnest money deposits\nwould accrue to the Company.\n41\nOne of the accounting estimates as described in the notes to our financial statements, is the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”), which is sensitive to a variety\nof inherent portfolio and external factors. REBL may be one of the more sensitive portfolios to such factors. In the second quarter of 2024, REBL loans\nclassified as either special mention or substandard increased to $176.4 million from $165.2 million at March 31, 2024. Each classified loan was evaluated for a\npotential increase in the ACL on the basis of third-party appraisals of related apartment building collateral. On the basis of “as is” and “as stabilized” loan to\nvalues (“LTV’s”), increases to the allowance for specific loans were not required. The respective weighted average “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs were 81%\nand 69%, based upon third party appraisals, the majority of which have been performed in 2024. The current allowance for credit losses for REBL, is primarily\nbased upon historical industry losses for multi-family loans, in the absence of significant historical losses within the Company’s REBL portfolio. However, as a\nresult of increasing amounts of loans classified as special mention and substandard, the Company will evaluate potential related sensitivity of that factor for\nREBL. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to change as more information becomes available. As\npart of the underwriting process, The Bancorp reviews borrowers’ previous rehabilitation experience in addition to overall financial wherewithal. These\ntransactions also include significant borrower equity contributions with required performance metrics. Underwriting generally includes, but is not limited to,\nassessment of local market information relating to vacancy and rental rates, review of post-rehabilitation rental rate assumptions against geo-specific\naffordability indices, negative news and lien searches, visitations by bank personnel and/or designated engineers, and other information sources. Rehabilitation\nprogress is monitored through ongoing draw requests and financial reporting covenants. This generally allows for early identification of potential issues, and\nexpedited action to address on a timely basis. Operations and ongoing loan evaluations are overseen by multiple levels of management, in addition to the real\nestate bridge lending team’s experienced professional staff and third-party consultants utilized during the underwriting and asset management process. This\noversight includes a separate loan committee specific to real estate bridge lending, which is comprised of seasoned and experienced lending professionals who\ndo not directly report to anyone on the real estate bridge lending team. There is also a separate loan review department, a surveillance committee and additional\nstaff which evaluate potential losses under the current expected credit losses methodology (“CECL”), all of which similarly do not report to anyone on the real\nestate bridge lending team.\nOverview\nThe Bancorp’s balance sheet has a risk profile enhanced by the special nature of the collateral supporting its loan niches, and related underwriting. Those loan\nniches have contributed to increased earnings levels, even during periods in which markets have experienced various economic stresses. Real estate bridge\nlending is comprised of workforce housing which we consider to be working class apartments at more affordable rental rates, in selected states. We believe that\nunderwriting requirements provide significant protection against loss, as supported by LTV ratios based on third-party appraisals. SBLOC and IBLOC loans are\nrespectively collateralized by marketable securities and the cash value of life insurance, while SBA loans are either SBA 7(a) loans that come with significant\ngovernment-related guarantees, or SBA 504 loans that are made at 50-60% LTVs. Additional detail with respect to these loan portfolios is included in the\nrelated tables in “Financial Condition.” Also enhancing Bancorp’s risk profile is the substantial earnings impact of its payment businesses.\nNature of Operations\nWe are a Delaware financial holding company and our primary, wholly-owned subsidiary is The Bancorp Bank, National Association (“the Bank”). The vast\nmajority of our revenue and income is currently generated through the Bank. In our continuing operations, we have four primary lines of specialty lending in\nour national specialty finance segment:\n(cid:0)x SBLOC, IBLOC, and investment advisor financing;\n(cid:0)x leasing (direct lease financing);\n(cid:0)x SBLs, consisting primarily of SBA loans;\n(cid:0)x non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans; and\n(cid:0)x beginning in 2024, consumer fintech lending.\nSBLOCs and IBLOCs are loans that are generated through affinity groups and are respectively collateralized by marketable securities and the cash value of\ninsurance policies. SBLOCs are typically offered in conjunction with brokerage accounts and are offered nationally. IBLOC loans are typically viewed as an\nalternative to standard policy loans from insurance companies and are utilized by our existing advisor base as well as insurance agents throughout the country.\nInvestment advisor financing are loans made to investment advisors for purposes of debt refinance, acquisition of another investment firm or internal\nsuccession. Vehicle fleet and, to a lesser extent, other equipment leases are generated in a number of Atlantic Coast and other states and are collateralized\nprimarily by vehicles. SBA loans are generated nationally and are collateralized by commercial properties and other types of collateral. Our non-SBA\ncommercial real estate bridge loans, at fair value, are primarily collateralized by multifamily properties (apartment buildings), and to a lesser extent, by hotel\nand retail properties. These loans were originally generated for sale through securitizations. In 2020, we decided to retain these loans on our balance sheet as\ninterest-earning assets and resumed originating such loans in the third quarter of 2021. These new originations are identified as real estate bridge loans, consist\nof apartment building loans, and are held for investment in the loan\n42\nportfolio. Prior originations originally intended for securitizations continue to be accounted for at fair value, and are included on the balance sheet in\n“Commercial loans, at fair value.”\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we initiated our measured entry into consumer fintech lending, by which we make consumer loans with the marketing and\nservicing assistance of existing and planned new fintech relationships. While the $70.1 million of such loans at June 30, 2024 did not significantly impact\nincome during the quarter, such lending is expected to meaningfully impact both the balance sheet and income in the future. We expect that impact will be\nreflected in a lower cost of funds for related deposits and increased transaction fees.\nThe majority of our deposits and non-interest income are generated in our payments segment, or Fintech Solutions Group, which consists of consumer\ntransaction accounts accessed by Bank-issued prepaid or debit cards and payment companies that process their clients’ corporate and consumer payments,\nautomated clearing house (“ACH”) accounts, the collection of card payments on behalf of merchants and other payments through our Bank. The card-accessed\ndeposit accounts are comprised of debit and prepaid card accounts that are generated by companies that market directly to end users. Our card-accessed deposit\naccount types are diverse and include: consumer and business debit, general purpose reloadable prepaid, pre-tax medical spending benefit, payroll, gift,\ngovernment, corporate incentive, reward, business payment accounts and others. Our ACH accounts facilitate bill payments and our acquiring accounts provide\nclearing and settlement services for payments made to merchants which must be settled through associations such as Visa or Mastercard. Consumer transaction\naccount banking services are provided to organizations with a pre-existing customer base tailored to support or complement the services provided by these\norganizations to their customers, which we refer to as “affinity or private label banking.” These services include loan and deposit accounts for investment\nadvisory companies through our Institutional Banking department. We typically provide these services under the name and through the facilities of each\norganization with whom we develop a relationship.\nPerformance Summary\nOur net income increased to $53.7 million for the second quarter of 2024, from $49.0 million for the second quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting a $6.6 million\nincrease in net interest income, a $1.4 million increase in non-interest income, and a $1.5 million increase in non-interest expense. Higher rates on loans\nresulted in increases in net interest income, which offset the impact of lower SBLOC and IBLOC balances. Our cost of funds rose to 2.50% in the second\nquarter of 2024, driven primarily by contractual adjustments for payments balances to Federal Reserve rate increases. See “Asset and Liability Management” in\nthis MD&A for further discussion of how our funding sources and loans adjust to Federal Reserve rate changes.\nPrepaid, debit card and other payment fees, including ACH, are the largest drivers of non-interest income. Such fees for the second quarter of 2024 increased\n$3.1 million over the comparable 2023 period.\nThere was a $1.5 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of $428,000 in the second quarter of\n2023.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe use a number of key performance indicators (“KPIs”) to measure our overall financial performance and believe they are useful to investors because they\nprovide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. We describe how we calculate and use a number of these KPIs and\nanalyze their results below.\n(cid:0)x Return on assets and return on equity. Two KPIs commonly used within the banking industry to measure overall financial performance are return on\nassets and return on equity. Return on assets measures the amount of earnings compared to the level of assets utilized to generate those earnings and is\nderived by dividing net income by average assets. Return on equity measures the amount of earnings compared to the equity utilized to generate those\nearnings and is derived by dividing net income by average shareholders’ equity.\n(cid:0)x Ratio of equity to assets. Ratio of equity to assets is another KPI frequently utilized within the banking industry and is derived by dividing period-end\nshareholders’ equity by period-end total assets.\n(cid:0)x Net interest margin and credit losses. Net interest margin is a KPI associated with net interest income, which is the largest component of our earnings\nand is the difference between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets consisting of loans and investments, less the interest on our funding,\nconsisting primarily of deposits. Net interest margin is derived by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Higher levels of\nearnings and net interest income on lower levels of assets, equity and interest-earning assets are generally desirable. However, these indicators must be\nconsidered in light of regulatory capital requirements, which impact equity, and credit risk inherent in loans. Accordingly, the magnitude of credit\nlosses is an additional KPI.\n43\n(cid:0)x Other KPIs. Other KPIs we use from time to time include growth in average loans and leases, non-interest income growth, the level of non-interest\nexpense and various capital measures including equity to assets.\nResults of KPIs\nIn the second quarter of 2024, return on assets and return on equity amounted to 2.77% and 27.10% (annualized), respectively, compared to 2.65% and 26.67%\n(annualized) in the second quarter of 2023. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2024, return on assets, and return on equity amounted to 2.86% and\n27.95% (annualized), respectively, compared to 2.64% and 27.42% (annualized) for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023.\nAt June 30, 2024, the ratio of equity to assets was 9.54%, compared to 9.93% at June 30, 2023, reflecting an increase in equity capital from retained earnings,\npartially offset by share repurchases.\nNet interest margin was 4.97% in the second quarter of 2024, versus 4.83% in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting a $6.6 million increase in net interest\nincome in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023.\nIncreases in the above KPIs in 2024 reflected the impact of higher rates on loans as a result of Federal Reserve rate increases, while the impact of loan growth\nin certain categories was significantly offset by SBLOC and IBLOC payoffs. We believe that these payoffs reflected customer sensitivity to the increasing rate\nenvironment. Average loans and leases increased to $5.75 billion in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $5.73 billion in the second quarter of 2023. The\nprovision for credit losses was $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of $428,000 in the second quarter of 2023.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements\nin conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the\naccompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We view critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with GAAP\nthat involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations. Our critical accounting policies and estimates as of June 30, 2024, remain unchanged from those presented in the 2023 Form 10-K under Part II,\nItem 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nResults of Operations\nComparison of second quarter 2024 to second quarter 2023\nNet Income\nNet income for the second quarter of 2024 was $53.7 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to $49.0 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for the second\nquarter of 2023. Income before income taxes was $71.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $66.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. Income\nincreased between those respective periods primarily as a result of higher net interest income, which reflected the impact of Federal Reserve rate increases on\nthe loan portfolio.\nNet Interest Income\nOur net interest income for the second quarter of 2024 increased $6.6 million, or 7.6%, to $93.8 million from $87.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. Our\ninterest income for the second quarter of 2024 increased to $137.3 million, an increase of $11.0 million, or 8.7%, from $126.3 million for the second quarter of\n2023. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in loan yields resulting from the aforementioned Federal Reserve rate increases, and loan growth as\nour average loans and leases increased to $5.75 billion for the second quarter of 2024 from $5.73 billion for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of\n$20.0 million, or 0.3%. Related interest income increased $7.7 million on a tax equivalent basis. SBLOC and IBLOC balances at June 30, 2024 grew slightly\ncompared to the prior quarter end, but were lower than the comparable prior year total. At June 30, 2024, the respective balances of SBLOC and IBLOC loans\nwere $975.3 million and $582.8 million, respectively, compared to $1.08 billion and $806.1 million at June 30, 2023. Loans in other categories with higher\nyields more than offset the SBLOC and IBLOC decreases, which also contributed to the higher net interest income.\nOf the total $7.7 million increase in loan interest income on a tax equivalent basis, the largest increases were $5.2 million for all real estate bridge loans, $3.4\nmillion for small business lending, $2.6 million for leasing and $1.3 million for investment advisor financing, while total SBLOC and IBLOC decreased $5.3\nmillion. Our average investment securities of $1.46 billion for the second quarter of 2024 increased $676.0 million from $781.3 million for the second quarter\nof 2023. Related tax equivalent interest income increased $7.6 million, primarily reflecting an increase in balances. Higher yields on loans reflected the\ncontinuing impact of Federal Reserve rate\n44\nincreases as variable rate repriced to higher rates and the growth of loan categories with higher rates, while lower yielding SBLOC and IBLOC balances\ndeclined. Federal Reserve rate changes had an immediate impact on cost of funds, while their impact on variable rate loans lags. Generally, interest expense is\ncontractually adjusted daily. Our variable rate loans generally reprice monthly or quarterly, although some reprice over several years.\nOur net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets) for the second quarter of 2024 was 4.97% compared to\n4.83% for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 14 basis points. While the yield on interest-earning assets increased 27 basis points, the cost of deposits\nand interest-bearing liabilities increased 13 basis points, or a net change of 14 basis points. Average interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank\ndecreased $359.2 million, or 51.2%, to $341.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 from $701.1 million in the second quarter of 2023. In the second quarter of\n2024, the average yield on our loans increased to 8.00% from 7.49% for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 51 basis points. Yields on taxable investment\nsecurities in the second quarter of 2024 decreased to 4.82% compared to 5.08% for the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of 26 basis points. The decrease in\ninvestment securities yields reflected the $1.3 million impact of placing a security in nonaccrual status as described in “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements herein.\n45\nAverage Daily Balances\nThe following table presents the average daily balances of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity and the respective interest earned or paid on interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as average annualized rates, for the periods indicated:\nT hr ee months en de (cid:0)(cid:3)d June 30, (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) Three (cid:0)(cid:3) m (cid:0)(cid:3)on (cid:0)(cid:3)ths ended J (cid:0)(cid:3)un (cid:0)(cid:3)e 3 (cid:0)(cid:3) 0,\n2024 2023 2024 vs 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\nDue to\nBalance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Volume Due to Rate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAssets:\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans, net of deferred loan fees and costs(1) $ 5,749,565 $ 114,970 8.00% $ 5,730,384 $ 107,299 7.49% $ 360 $ 7,311 $ 7,671\nLeases-bank qualified(2) 4,621 117 10.13% 3,801 100 10.52% 21 (4) 17\nInvestment securities-taxable 1,454,393 17,520 4.82% 778,100 9,873 5.08% 8,120 (473) 7,647\nInvestment securities-nontaxable(2) 2,895 50 6.91% 3,234 53 6.56% (6) 3 (3)\nInterest-earning deposits at Federal Reserve Bank 341,863 4,677 5.47% 701,057 8,997 5.13% (4,959) 639 (4,320)\nNet interest-earning assets 7,553,337 137,334 7.27% 7,216,576 126,322 7.00%\nAllowance for credit losses (28,568) (23,895)\nOther assets 266,061 231,035\n$ 7,790,830 $ 7,423,716 3,536 7,476 11,012\nLiabilities and shareholders' equity:\nDeposits:\nDemand and interest checking $ 6,657,386 $ 39,542 2.38% $ 6,399,750 $ 36,688 2.29% 1,505 1,349 2,854\nSavings and money market 60,212 457 3.04% 78,252 728 3.72% (151) (120) (271)\nTotal deposits 6,717,598 39,999 2.38% 6,478,002 37,416 2.31%\nShort-term borrowings 92,412 1,295 5.61% — — — 1,295 — 1,295\nRepurchase agreements — — — 41 — — — — —\nLong-term borrowings 38,362 685 7.14% 9,949 128 5.15% 490 67 557\nSubordinated debt 13,401 291 8.69% 13,401 271 8.09% — 20 20\nSenior debt 95,984 1,234 5.14% 96,890 1,280 5.28% (12) (34) (46)\nTotal deposits and liabilities 6,957,757 43,504 2.50% 6,598,283 39,095 2.37%\nOther liabilities 36,195 88,276\nTotal liabilities 6,993,952 6,686,559 3,127 1,282 4,409\nShareholders' equity 796,878 737,157\n$ 7,790,830 $ 7,423,716\nNet interest income on tax equivalent basis(2) $ 93,830 $ 87,227 $ 409 $ 6,194 $ 6,603\nTax equivalent adjustment 35 32\nNet interest income $ 93,795 $ 87,195\nNet interest margin(2) 4.97% 4.83%\n(1) Includes commercial loans, at fair value.

The increase reflected decreased average interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of $359.2 million, the impact of which\nwas more than offset by increased average balances of loans and leases of $20.0 million, or 0.3%, and increased average investment securities of\n$676.0 million, or 86.5%. The increase reflected the purchase of approximately $900 million of fixed rate securities to reduce exposure to possible future\nFederal Reserve rate decreases. For those respective periods, average demand and interest checking deposits increased $257.6 million, or 4.0%. The interest\nexpense shown for demand and interest checking is primarily comprised of interest paid to our affinity groups.\n46\nProvision for Credit Losses\nOur provision for credit losses was $1.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to a provision of $428,000 for the second quarter of 2023. The ACL\nwas $28.6 million, or 0.51% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, compared to $27.4 million, or 0.51% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The provision reflected\ncontinuing higher leasing net charge-offs, primarily in long haul and local trucking, transportation and related activities for which total exposure was\napproximately $34 million at June 30, 2024. We believe that our ACL is appropriate and supportable. For more information about our provision and ACL and\nour loss experience, see “Financial Condition – Allowance for Credit Losses,” “– Net Charge-offs,” and “– Non-performing Loans, Loans 90 days Delinquent\nand Still Accruing, OREO, Modified Loans and Troubled Debt Restructurings,” below and “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements\nherein.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income was $30.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $29.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. The $1.4 million, or 4.7%,\nincrease between those respective periods reflected an increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees. Prepaid, debit card and related fees increased $2.6\nmillion, or 11.6%, to $24.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $22.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase reflected higher\ntransaction volume from new clients and organic growth from existing clients. ACH, card and other payment processing fees increased $571,000, or 23.5%, to\n$3.0 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $2.4 million in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting an increase in rapid funds transfer volume.\nNet realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, at fair value, decreased $1.4 million, or 73.8%, to $503,000 for the second quarter of 2024 from $1.9\nmillion for the second quarter of 2023. The decrease reflected the runoff of the commercial loans, at fair value portfolio, which has continued to reduce the\nvolume of loan payoffs and the income recognized at the time of payoff.\nLeasing related income decreased $82,000, or 5.4%, to $1.4 million for the second quarter of 2024 from $1.5 million for the second quarter of 2023.\nConsumer fintech fees amounted to $140,000 for the second quarter of 2024, as we began our entry into consumer fintech lending. Such lending may also be\nreflected in a lower cost of deposits, as a result of associated deposits.\nOther non-interest income decreased $403,000, or 31.0%, to $895,000 for the second quarter of 2024 from $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2023 which\nreflected higher prepayment fees on advisor financing loans.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense was $51.4 million for the second quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 million, or 3.0%, compared to $49.9 million for the second\nquarter of 2023. A 2.1%, increase in salaries and employee benefits expense reflected increases in payments related financial crimes and IT salary expense,\nwhich were partially offset by decreases in incentive compensation.\n47\nThe following table presents the principal categories of non-interest expense for the periods indicated:\nFor the three mon ths end ed June 30,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 33,863 $ 33,167 $ 696 2.1%\nDepreciation and amortization 1,027 681 346 50.8%\nRent and related occupancy cost 1,686 1,361 325 23.9%\nData processing expense 1,423 1,398 25 1.8%\nPrinting and supplies 59 128 (69) (53.9%)\nAudit expense 319 417 (98) (23.5%)\nLegal expense 633 949 (316) (33.3%)\nAmortization of intangible assets 100 100 — —\nFDIC insurance 869 472 397 84.1%\nSoftware 4,637 4,317 320 7.4%\nInsurance 1,282 1,308 (26) (2.0%)\nTelecom and IT network communications 354 363 (9) (2.5%)\nConsulting 562 642 (80) (12.5%)\nWrite-downs and other losses on other real estate owned — 165 (165) (100.0%)\nOther 4,632 4,475 157 3.5%\nTotal non-interest expense $ 51,446 $ 49,943 $ 1,503 3.0%\nChanges in categories of non-interest expense were as follows:\n(cid:0)x Salaries and employee benefits expense increased to $33.9 million for the second quarter of 2024, an increase of $696,000, or 2.1%, from\n$33.2 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Depreciation and amortization expense increased $346,000, or 50.8%, to $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 from $681,000 in the second\nquarter of 2023, reflecting the impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n(cid:0)x Rent and related occupancy cost increased $325,000, or 23.9%, to $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 from $1.4 million in the second quarter of\n2023, reflecting the impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n(cid:0)x Data processing expense increased $25,000, or 1.8%, to $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 from $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2023,\nreflecting higher transaction volume.\n(cid:0)x Printing and supplies expense decreased $69,000, or 53.9%, to $59,000 in the second quarter of 2024 from $128,000 in the second quarter of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Audit expense decreased $98,000, or 23.5%, to $319,000 in the second quarter of 2024 from $417,000 in the second quarter of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Legal expense decreased $316,000, or 33.3%, to $633,000 in the second quarter of 2024 from $949,000 in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting a\nreimbursement of legal fees related to the Del Mar complaint described in “Note O. Commitments and Contingencies” to the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K.\n(cid:0)x FDIC insurance expense increased $397,000, or 84.1%, to $869,000 for the second quarter of 2024 from $472,000 in the second quarter of 2023,\nreflecting a reduction in the quarterly assessed rate in 2023.\n(cid:0)x Software expense increased $320,000, or 7.4%, to $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 from $4.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. The\nincrease reflected higher expenditures for information technology infrastructure including leasing, institutional banking, cybersecurity, and enterprise\nrisk, which more than offset decreased expenses related to financial crimes management.\n(cid:0)x Insurance expense decreased $26,000, or 2.0%, to $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Telecom and IT network communications expense decreased $9,000, or 2.5%, to $354,000 in the second quarter of 2024 from $363,000 in the second\nquarter of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Consulting expense decreased $80,000, or 12.5%, to $562,000 in the second quarter of 2024 from $642,000 in the second quarter of 2023. The\ndecrease reflected a wire and ACH risk assessment conducted in 2023.\n48\n(cid:0)x Other non-interest expense increased $157,000, or 3.5%, to $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 from $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2023.\nDecreases in multiple expense categories were more than offset by a $708,000 increase in other real estate owned expense and a $174,000 increase in\ntravel. The $708,000 increase in other real estate owned expense, reflected expenses on the $39.4 million apartment property transferred to OREO in\nthe second quarter of 2024, as described in “Note 6. Loans.”\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $18.1 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $17.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase resulted primarily\nfrom an increase in income, substantially all of which is subject to income tax. A 25.2% effective tax rate in 2024 and a 26.0% effective tax rate in 2023\nprimarily reflected a 21% federal tax rate and the impact of various state income taxes.\nComparison of first six months 2024 to first six months 2023\nNet Income\nNet income for the first six months of 2024 was $110.1 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, compared to $98.1 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, for the first\nsix months of 2023. Income before income taxes was $146.7 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to $131.1 million in the first six months of 2023.\nIncome increased between those respective periods primarily as a result of higher net interest income, which reflected the impact of Federal Reserve rate\nincreases on the loan and securities portfolios while growth in higher yielding loan categories offset reductions in lower yielding SBLOC and IBLOC balances.\nNet Interest Income\nOur net interest income for the first six months of 2024 increased $15.2 million, or 8.8%, to $188.2 million from $173.0 million in the first six months of 2023.\nOur interest income for the first six months of 2024 increased to $273.1 million, an increase of $24.6 million, or 9.9%, from $248.5 million for the first six\nmonths of 2023. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in loan yields resulting from the aforementioned Federal Reserve rate increases, as our\naverage loans and leases decreased to $5.74 billion for the first six months of 2024 from $5.86 billion for the first six months of 2023, a decrease of\n$123.5 million, or 2.1%. Related interest income increased $15.7 million on a tax equivalent basis. Net paydowns of SBLOC and IBLOC continued in the first\nquarter of 2024, which partially offset the impact of higher rates and loan growth in other categories. At June 30, 2024, the respective balances of SBLOC and\nIBLOC loans were $975.3 million and $582.8 million, respectively, compared to $1.08 billion and $806.1 million at June 30, 2023. Loans in other categories\nwith higher yields partially offset the SBLOC and IBLOC decreases, which also contributed to the higher net interest income.\nOf the total $15.7 million increase in loan interest income on a tax equivalent basis, the largest increases were $12.4 million for all real estate bridge loans, $6.3\nmillion for small business lending, $5.3 million for leasing and $2.7 million for investment advisor financing, while total SBLOC and IBLOC decreased $12.1\nmillion. Our average investment securities of $1.10 billion for the first six months of 2024 increased $317.5 million from $779.4 million for the first six months\nof 2023. Related tax equivalent interest income increased $8.0 million, primarily reflecting an increase in balances. Higher yields on loans reflected the\ncontinuing impact of Federal Reserve rate increases as variable rate loans repriced to higher rates. Federal Reserve rate changes had an immediate impact on\ncost of funds, while their impact on variable rate loans lags. Generally, interest expense is contractually adjusted daily. The majority of our loans and securities\nare variable rate and generally reprice monthly or quarterly, although some reprice over several years.\nOur net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets) for the first six months of 2024 was 5.06% compared to\n4.75% for the first six months of 2023, an increase of 31 basis points. While the yield on interest-earning assets increased 51 basis points, the cost of deposits\nand interest-bearing liabilities increased 24 basis points, or a net change of 27 basis points. The more pronounced increase in the net interest margin compared\nto the net change reflected the impact of higher rates on assets funded by equity. Investment securities yields reflected the $1.3 million second quarter 2024\nimpact of placing a security in nonaccrual status as described in “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein. Average interest-\nearning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank decreased $32.9 million, or 5.1%, to $608.0 million in the first six months of 2024 from $640.9 million in the first\nsix months of 2023. In the first six months of 2024, the average yield on our loans increased to 7.99% from 7.29% for the first six months of 2023, an increase\nof 70 basis points. Yields on taxable investment securities in the first six months of 2024 increased to 4.96% compared to 4.94% for the first six months of\n2023, an increase of 2 basis points.\n49\nAverage Daily Balances\nThe following table presents the average daily balances of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity and the respective interest earned or paid on interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as average annualized rates, for the periods indicated:\nSi x months e nd ed June 30, Six m o nt hs ended Ju ne 30 ,\n2024 2023 2024 vs 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\nDue to\nBalance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Volume Due to Rate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAssets:\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans, net of deferred loan fees and costs(1) $ 5,733,413 $ 229,130 7.99% $ 5,858,040 $ 213,503 7.29% $ (4,418) $ 20,045 $ 15,627\nLeases-bank qualified(2) 4,683 233 9.95% 3,582 169 9.44% 54 10 64\nInvestment securities-taxable 1,093,996 27,154 4.96% 776,089 19,173 4.94% 7,890 91 7,981\nInvestment securities-nontaxable(2) 2,895 100 6.91% 3,288 94 5.72% (8) 14 6\nInterest-earning deposits at Federal Reserve Bank 607,968 16,561 5.45% 640,864 15,582 4.86% (728) 1,707 979\nNet interest-earning assets 7,442,955 273,178 7.34% 7,281,863 248,521 6.83%\nAllowance for credit losses (27,862) (23,215)\nOther assets 323,244 234,037\n$ 7,738,337 $ 7,492,685 2,790 21,867 24,657\nLiabilities and shareholders' equity:\nDeposits:\nDemand and interest checking $ 6,553,107 $ 78,256 2.39% $ 6,401,678 $ 69,071 2.16% 1,665 7,520 9,185\nSavings and money market 55,591 904 3.25% 105,105 1,947 3.70% (828) (215) (1,043)\nTime — — — 41,933 858 4.09% (858) — (858)\nTotal deposits 6,608,698 79,160 2.40% 6,548,716 71,876 2.20%\nShort-term borrowings 46,892 1,314 5.60% 10,193 234 4.59% 1,018 62 1,080\nRepurchase agreements 6 — — 41 — — — — —\nLong-term borrowings 38,439 1,371 7.13% 9,973 254 5.09% 980 137 1,117\nSubordinated debt 13,401 583 8.70% 13,401 532 7.94% — 51 51\nSenior debt 95,939 2,467 5.14% 97,985 2,559 5.22% (53) (39) (92)\nTotal deposits and liabilities 6,803,375 84,895 2.50% 6,680,309 75,455 2.26%\nOther liabilities 142,826 90,777\nTotal liabilities 6,946,201 6,771,086 1,924 7,516 9,440\nShareholders' equity 792,136 721,599\n$ 7,738,337 $ 7,492,685\nNet interest income on tax equivalent basis(2) $ 188,283 $ 173,066 $ 866 $ 14,351 $ 15,217\nTax equivalent adjustment 70 55\nNet interest income $ 188,213 $ 173,011\nNet interest margin(2) 5.06% 4.75%\n(1) Includes commercial loans, at fair value.

The increase reflected decreased average interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of $32.9 million and decreased average\nbalances of loans and leases of $123.5 million, or 2.1%, the impact of which was more than offset by increased average investment securities of $317.5 million,\nor 40.7%. For those respective periods, average demand and interest checking deposits increased $151.4 million, or 2.4%. The interest expense shown for\ndemand and interest checking is primarily comprised of interest paid to our affinity groups.\n50\nProvision for Credit Losses\nOur provision for credit losses was $3.8 million for the first six months of 2024 compared to a provision of $2.6 million for the first six months of 2023. The\nACL was $28.6 million, or 0.51% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, compared to $27.4 million, or 0.51% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The provision\nreflected continuing higher leasing net charge-offs, primarily in long haul and local trucking, transportation and related activities for which total exposure was\napproximately $34 million at June 30, 2024. We believe that our ACL is appropriate and supportable. For more information about our provision and ACL and\nour loss experience, see “Financial Condition – Allowance for Credit Losses,” “– Net Charge-offs,” and “– Non-performing Loans, Loans 90 days Delinquent\nand Still Accruing, OREO, Modified Loans and Troubled Debt Restructurings,” below and “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements\nherein.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income was $60.1 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to $58.3 million in the first six months of 2023. The $1.8 million, or 3.1%,\nincrease between those respective periods reflected an increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees. Prepaid, debit card and related fees increased $3.5\nmillion, or 7.8%, to $49.0 million for the first six months of 2024, compared to $45.5 million in the first six months of 2023. The first quarter of 2023 included\napproximately $600,000 of non-interest income related to the fourth quarter of 2022, and a $1.4 million termination fee from a client which formed its own\nbank. The increase reflected higher transaction volume from new clients and organic growth from existing clients. ACH, card and other payment processing\nfees increased $1.4 million, or 29.7%, to $6.0 million for the first six months of 2024, compared to $4.6 million in the first six months of 2023, reflecting an\nincrease in rapid funds transfer volume.\nNet realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, at fair value, decreased $2.0 million, or 56.1%, to $1.6 million for the first six months of 2024 from\n$3.6 million for the first six months of 2023. The decrease reflected the runoff of the commercial loans, at fair value portfolio, which has continued to reduce\nthe volume of loan payoffs and the income recognized at the time of payoff.\nLeasing related income decreased $1.2 million, or 39.5%, to $1.8 million for the first six months of 2024 from $3.0 million for the first six months of 2023,\nreflecting $1.1 million of losses related to an auto auction company which ceased operations.\nConsumer fintech fees amounted to $140,000 for 2024, as we began our entry into consumer fintech lending. Such lending may also be reflected in a lower cost\nof deposits, as a result of associated deposits.\nOther non-interest income decreased $35,000, or 2.2%, to $1.5 million for the first six months of 2024 from $1.6 million in the first six months of 2023.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense was $98.2 million for the first six months of 2024, an increase of $185,000, or 0.2%, compared to $98.0 million for the first six\nmonths of 2023. While salaries and employee benefits increased 1.9%, increases in the payments business and related financial crimes and in IT salary expense,\nwere offset by decreases in incentive compensation.\n51\nThe following table presents the principal categories of non-interest expense for the periods indicated:\nFor the six mont hs e nde d June 30,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 64,143 $ 62,952 $ 1,191 1.9%\nDepreciation and amortization 1,976 1,402 574 40.9%\nRent and related occupancy cost 3,326 2,755 571 20.7%\nData processing expense 2,844 2,719 125 4.6%\nPrinting and supplies 162 273 (111) (40.7%)\nAudit expense 678 809 (131) (16.2%)\nLegal expense 1,454 1,907 (453) (23.8%)\nAmortization of intangible assets 199 199 — —\nFDIC insurance 1,714 1,427 287 20.1%\nSoftware 9,126 8,554 572 6.7%\nInsurance 2,620 2,614 6 0.2%\nTelecom and IT network communications 625 739 (114) (15.4%)\nConsulting 1,140 964 176 18.3%\nWrite-downs and other losses on OREO — 1,184 (1,184) (100.0%)\nOther 8,151 9,475 (1,324) (14.0%)\nTotal non-interest expense $ 98,158 $ 97,973 $ 185 0.2%\nChanges in categories of non-interest expense were as follows:\n(cid:0)x Salaries and employee benefits expense increased to $64.1 million for the first six months of 2024, an increase of $1.2 million, or 1.9%, from\n$63.0 million for the first six months of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Depreciation and amortization expense increased $574,000, or 40.9%, to $2.0 million in the first six months of 2024 from $1.4 million in the first six\nmonths of 2023, reflecting the impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n(cid:0)x Rent and related occupancy cost increased $571,000, or 20.7%, to $3.3 million in the first six months of 2024 from $2.8 million in the first six months\nof 2023, reflecting the impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n(cid:0)x Data processing expense increased $125,000, or 4.6%, to $2.8 million in the first six months of 2024 from $2.7 million in the first six months of 2023,\nreflecting higher transaction volume.\n(cid:0)x Printing and supplies expense decreased $111,000, or 40.7%, to $162,000 in the first six months of 2024 from $273,000 in the first six months of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Audit expense decreased $131,000, or 16.2%, to $678,000 in the first six months of 2024 from $809,000 in the first six months of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Legal expense decreased $453,000, or 23.8%, to $1.5 million in the first six months of 2024 from $1.9 million in the first six months of 2023,\nreflecting a reimbursement of legal fees related to the Del Mar complaint described in “Note O. Commitments and Contingencies” to the audited\nconsolidated financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K.\n(cid:0)x FDIC insurance expense increased $287,000, or 20.1%, to $1.7 million for the first six months of 2024 from $1.4 million in the first six months of\n2023, reflecting a reduction in the quarterly assessed rate in 2023.\n(cid:0)x Software expense increased $572,000, or 6.7%, to $9.1 million in the first six months of 2024 from $8.6 million in the first six months of 2023. The\nincrease reflected higher expenditures for information technology infrastructure including leasing, institutional banking, cybersecurity, cloud\ncomputing and enterprise risk, which more than offset decreasing expenses related to financial crimes management.\n(cid:0)x Insurance expense increased $6,000, or 0.2%, to $2.6 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to $2.6 million in the first six months of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Telecom and IT network communications expense decreased $114,000, or 15.4%, to $625,000 in the first six months of 2024 from $739,000 in the first\nsix months of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Consulting expense increased $176,000, or 18.3%, to $1.1 million in the first six months of 2024 from $964,000 in the first six months of 2023. The\nincrease reflected expenses related to the Company’s ongoing efforts of documenting and optimizing operational controls.\n52\n(cid:0)x Other non-interest expense decreased $1.3 million, or 14.0%, to $8.2 million in the first six months of 2024 from $9.5 million in the first six months of\n2023. In addition to lesser decreases in a number of other categories, the $1.3 million decrease reflected the following decreases: a. regulatory\nexamination fees of $284,000 b. contributions of $247,000 and c. other operating taxes of $267,000. Those decreases more than offset an increase of\n$336,000 in other real estate owned expense, which reflected expenses on the $39.4 million apartment property transferred to OREO in the second\nquarter of 2024, as described in “Note 6. Loans.”\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $36.6 million for the first six months of 2024 compared to $33.0 million in the first six months of 2023. The increase resulted primarily\nfrom an increase in income, substantially all of which is subject to income tax. A 25.0% effective tax rate in 2024 and a 25.1% effective tax rate in 2023\nprimarily reflected a 21% federal tax rate and the impact of various state income taxes.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity defines our ability to generate funds at a reasonable cost to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals, satisfy borrowing needs and otherwise\noperate on an ongoing basis. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution’s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected\ncash flows without adversely affecting daily operations or financial condition. The Company’s liquidity management policy requirements include sustaining\ndefined liquidity minimums, concentration monitoring and management, stress testing, contingency planning and related oversight. Based on our sources of\nfunding and liquidity discussed below, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for our needs in the next 12 months and for the\nforeseeable future. We invest the funds we do not need for daily operations primarily in overnight federal funds or in our interest-bearing account at the Federal\nReserve.\nOur primary source of funding has been deposits. Average total deposits increased by $239.6 million, or 3.7%, to $6.72 billion for the second quarter of 2024\ncompared to the second quarter of 2023. The increase reflected the planned exit of higher cost deposits. Federal Reserve average balances decreased to\n$341.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 from $701.1 million in the second quarter of 2023. The decrease reflected approximately $900 million of securities\npurchases in April 2024 as discussed under “Asset and Liability Management” in this MD&A. Additionally, as a result of those purchases, we have increased\nthe use of FHLB advances to partially fund such purchases, at least temporarily, and those advances averaged approximately $92.4 million for second quarter\n2024.\nOne source of contingent liquidity is available-for-sale securities, which amounted to $1.58 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $747.5 million at December\n31, 2023, reflecting the aforementioned securities purchases. The majority of these securities, including those $900 million of April 2024 purchases, can be\npledged to facilitate extensions of credit in addition to loans already pledged against lines of credit, as discussed later in this section. At June 30, 2024,\noutstanding loans amounted to $5.61 billion, compared to $5.36 billion at the prior year end, an increase of $244.6 million representing a use of funds.\nCommercial loans, at fair value, decreased to $265.2 million from $332.8 million between those respective dates, a decrease of $67.6 million, which provided\nfunding. In 2019 and previous years, these loans were generally originated for securitization and sale, but in 2020 we decided to retain such loans on the\nbalance sheet. While we suspended originating such loans after the first quarter of 2020, we resumed originations, which consist primarily of non-SBA\ncommercial real estate bridge loans, in the third quarter of 2021. Such originations are held for investment and are included in “Loans, net of deferred loan fees\nand costs” on the balance sheet. Accordingly, commercial loans, at fair value will continue to run off. Our liquidity planning has not previously placed undue\nreliance on securitizations, and while our future planning excludes the impact of securitizations, other liquidity sources, primarily deposits, are determined to be\nadequate.\nWhile we do not have a traditional branch system, we believe that our core deposits, which include our demand, interest checking, savings and money market\naccounts, have similar characteristics to those of a bank with a branch system. The majority of our deposit accounts are obtained with the assistance of third-\nparties and as a result have historically been classified as brokered by the FDIC. Prior to December 2020, FDIC guidance for classification of deposit accounts\nas brokered was relatively broad, and generally included accounts which were referred to or “placed” with the institution by other companies. If the Bank ceases\nto be categorized as “well capitalized” under banking regulations, it will be prohibited from accepting, renewing or rolling over any of its deposits classified as\nbrokered without the consent of the FDIC. In such a case, the FDIC’s refusal to grant consent to our accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits could\neffectively restrict or eliminate the ability of the Bank to operate its business lines as presently conducted. In December 2020, the FDIC issued a new regulation\nwhich, in the third quarter of 2021, resulted in the majority of our deposits being reclassified from brokered to non-brokered. On July 30, 2024, the FDIC\nproposed a regulation eliminating certain automatic exceptions which resulted in the reclassification of significant amounts of our deposits from brokered to\nnon-brokered as a result of the December 2020 rules changes, while retaining the ability of financial institutions to reapply. If the proposed regulation is\nadopted, significant amounts of our deposits could be reclassified as brokered, which could also result in an increase in our federal deposit insurance rate and\nexpense. Of our total deposits of $7.16 billion as of June 30, 2024, $440.8 million were classified as brokered and an estimated $493.8 million were not insured\nby FDIC insurance, which requires identification of the depositor and is limited to $250,000 per identified depositor. Uninsured accounts may represent a\ngreater liquidity risk than FDIC-insured accounts should large depositors\n53\nwithdraw funds as a result of negative financial developments either at the Bank or in the economy. Significant amounts of our uninsured deposits are\ncomprised of small balances, such as anonymous gift cards and corporate incentive cards for which there is no identified depositor. We do not believe that such\nuninsured accounts present a significant liquidity risk.\nCertain components of our deposits experience seasonality, creating greater excess liquidity at certain times. The largest deposit inflows occur in the first\nquarter of the year when certain of our accounts are credited with tax refund payments from the U.S. Treasury.\nWhile consumer deposit accounts, including prepaid and debit card accounts, comprise the vast majority of our funding needs, we maintain secured borrowing\nlines with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve. Our collateralized line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank had available accessible capacity of $1.94 billion\nas of June 30, 2024, and was collateralized by loans. We have also pledged in excess of $2.07 billion of multifamily loans to the FHLB. As a result, we have\napproximately $1.12 billion of availability on that line of credit which we can also access at any time. As of June 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding\non either of these lines of credit. We expect to continue to maintain our facilities with the FHLB and Federal Reserve.\nAnother source of contingent liquidity is available-for-sale securities, which amounted to $1.58 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $747.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. In excess of $1.0 billion of our available-for-sale securities are U.S. government-sponsored agency securities which are highly liquid and\nmay be immediately pledged as additional collateral. We actively monitor our positions and contingent funding sources daily.\nAs a holding company conducting substantially all our business through our subsidiaries, the Company’s near-term need for liquidity consists principally of\ncash for required interest payments on our subordinated debentures, consisting of 2038 Debentures, and senior debt, consisting of $100.0 million senior notes\nwith an interest rate of 4.75% and maturing in August 2025 (the “2025 Senior Notes”). Semi-annual interest payments on the 2025 Senior Notes are\napproximately $2.4 million, and quarterly interest payments on the 2038 Debentures are approximately $300,000. As of June 30, 2024, we had cash reserves of\napproximately $8.8 million at the holding company. Stock repurchases are funded by dividends from the Bank, as are interest payments on the above debt\ninstruments. Stock repurchases may be terminated at any time. The holding company’s sources of liquidity are primarily comprised of dividends paid by the\nBank to the Company, and the issuance of debt.\nIncluded in our cash and cash-equivalents at June 30, 2024 were $399.9 million of interest-earning deposits which primarily consisted of deposits with the\nFederal Reserve.\nIn 2024, $85.2 million of redemptions were exceeded by purchases of $913.1 million of securities. We had outstanding commitments to fund loans, including\nunused lines of credit, of $1.76 billion and $1.79 billion as of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority of our commitments are\nvariable rate and originate with SBLOC. The recorded amount of such commitments has, for many accounts, been based on the full amount of collateral in a\ncustomer’s investment account. The funding requirements for such commitments occur on a measured basis over time and would be funded by normal deposit\ngrowth. Additionally, these loans are “demand” loans and as such, represent a contingent source of funding.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\nWe must comply with capital adequacy guidelines issued by our regulators. A bank must, in general, have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.00%, a ratio of Tier I\ncapital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10.0% and a ratio of common equity tier 1 to risk weighted assets of\n6.5% to be considered “well capitalized.” The Tier I leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets for the quarter. “Tier I capital” includes\ncommon shareholders’ equity, certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less\nintangibles. At June 30, 2024, the Bank was “well capitalized” under banking regulations.\nThe following table sets forth our regulatory capital amounts and ratios for the periods indicated:\n(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) Tier 1 capital (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) Tier 1 capital (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) Total capital (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) Common equity\nto average to risk-weighted to risk-weighted tier 1 to risk\nassets ratio assets ratio assets ratio weighted assets\nAs of June 30, 2024\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 10.07% 14.13% 14.68% 14.13%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 11.21% 15.69% 16.24% 15.69%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\nAs of December 31, 2023\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 11.19% 15.66% 16.23% 15.66%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 12.37% 17.35% 17.92% 17.35%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\n54\nAsset and Liability Management\nThe management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is essential to controlling interest rate risk and optimizing interest margins. An interest rate sensitive asset\nor liability is one that, within a defined time period, either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market rates. Interest rate\nsensitivity measures the relative volatility of an institution’s interest margin resulting from changes in market interest rates. While it is difficult to predict the\nimpact of inflation and responsive Federal Reserve rate changes on our net interest income, the Federal Reserve has historically utilized increases in the\novernight federal funds rate as one tool in fighting inflation. As a result of high rates of inflation, the Federal Reserve raised rates in each quarter of 2022 and in\nthe first three quarters of 2023. Our largest funding source, prepaid and debit card deposit accounts, contractually adjusts to only a portion of increases or\ndecreases in rates which are largely determined by such Federal Reserve actions. That pricing has generally supported the maintenance of a balance sheet for\nwhich net interest income tends to increase with increases in rates. While deposits reprice to only a portion of Federal Reserve rate changes, such changes are\nimmediate. Interest-earning assets, comprised primarily of loans and securities, tend to adjust more fully to rate increases at lagged contractual pricing intervals.\nThe majority of our loans and securities are variable rate and generally reprice monthly or quarterly, although some reprice over several years. Additionally, the\nimpact of loan interest rate floors which must be exceeded before rates on certain loans increase, may result in decreases in net interest income with lesser\nincreases in rates. Cumulative 2022 Federal Reserve interest rate increases resulted in contractual rates on loans generally exceeding rate floors beginning in the\nsecond quarter of 2022.\nWe have adopted policies designed to manage net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements. To effectively administer\nthe policies and to monitor our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintain an asset/liability committee, consisting of the Bank’s Chief Executive\nOfficer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer and others. This committee meets quarterly to review our financial results,\ndevelop strategies to optimize margins and to respond to market conditions. The primary goal of our policies is to optimize margins and manage interest rate\nrisk, subject to overall policy constraints for prudent management of interest rate risk.\nWe monitor, manage and control interest rate risk through a variety of techniques, including the use of traditional interest rate sensitivity analysis (also known\nas “gap analysis”) and an interest rate risk management model. With the interest rate risk management model, we project future net interest income and then\nestimate the effect of various changes in interest rates on that projected net interest income. We also use the interest rate risk management model to calculate the\nchange in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios. Traditional gap analysis involves arranging our interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities by repricing periods and then computing the difference (or “interest rate sensitivity gap”) between the assets and liabilities that we estimate\nwill reprice during each time period and cumulatively through the end of each time period.\nBoth interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis are done at a specific point in time and involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions.\nInterest rate sensitivity modeling requires, among other things, estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest-earning\nassets and interest-bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates, future cash flows and discount rates. Gap analysis requires estimates as to\nwhen individual categories of interest-sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice, and assumes that assets and liabilities assigned to the same repricing period\nwill reprice at the same time and in the same amount. Gap analysis does not account for the fact that repricing of assets and liabilities is discretionary and\nsubject to competitive and other pressures. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate\nsensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets. During a period of\nfalling interest rates, a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest\nincome. During a period of rising interest rates, a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to\naffect net interest income adversely.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing structure of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at June 30, 2024. Except\nas stated below, the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual\nterms of each asset or liability. The majority of transaction and savings balances are assumed to be “core” deposits, or deposits that will generally remain with\nus regardless of market interest rates. We estimate the repricing characteristics of these deposits based on historical performance, past experience, judgmental\npredictions and other deposit behavior assumptions. However, we may choose not to reprice liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates for\ncompetitive or other reasons. Additionally, although non-interest-bearing transaction accounts are not paid interest, we estimate certain of the balances will\nreprice as a result of the contractual fees that are paid to the affinity groups which are based upon a rate index, and therefore are included in interest expense.\nWe have adjusted the transaction account balances in the table downward, to better reflect the impact of their partial adjustment to changes in rates. Loans and\nsecurity balances, which adjust more fully to market rate changes, are based upon actual balances. The table does not assume any prepayment of fixed-rate\nloans and mortgage-backed securities are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow, including prepayments based on historical data and current market\ntrends. The table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on our net interest income because the repricing and related\nbehavior of certain categories of assets and liabilities (for example, prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits) is beyond our control. As a result, certain\nassets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a stated period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels.\n55\nFor instance, the majority of REBL loans are variable rate with floors, but prepayments may offset the benefit of such floors in decreasing rate environments.\n1-90 91-364 1-3 3-5 Over 5\nDays Days Years Years Years\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest-earning assets:\nCommercial loans, at fair value $ 105,583 $ 118,016 $ 24,553 $ 15,005 $ 2,036\nLoans, net of deferred loan fees and costs 3,247,523 271,411 1,195,399 698,112 193,282\nInvestment securities 335,320 66,447 139,485 176,281 863,473\nInterest-earning deposits 399,853 — — — —\nTotal interest-earning assets 4,088,279 455,874 1,359,437 889,398 1,058,791\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nTransaction accounts as adjusted(1) 3,547,696 — — — —\nSavings and money market 60,297 — — — —\nSenior debt and subordinated debentures 13,401 — 96,037 — —\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,621,394 — 96,037 — —\nGap $ 466,885 $ 455,874 $ 1,263,400 $ 889,398 $ 1,058,791\nCumulative gap $ 466,885 $ 922,759 $ 2,186,159 $ 3,075,557 $ 4,134,348\nGap to assets ratio 6% 5% 16% 11% 13%\nCumulative gap to assets ratio 6% 11% 27% 38% 51%\n(1) Transaction accounts are comprised primarily of demand deposits. While demand deposits are non-interest-bearing, related fees paid to affinity groups may reprice according to specified indices.\nThe methods used to analyze interest rate sensitivity in this table have a number of limitations. Certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in\ninterest rates even though they reprice or mature in the same or similar time periods. The interest rates on certain assets and liabilities may change at different\ntimes than market interest rates, with some changing in advance of changes in market rates and some lagging behind changes in market rates. Additionally, the\nactual prepayments and withdrawals we experience when interest rates change may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the data shown in\nthe table. Accordingly, actual results can and often do differ from projections.\nWe believe that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable; however, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments, as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income, could vary\nsubstantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from presumed behavior of various deposit and loan categories. The following table\nshows the effects of interest rate shocks on our net portfolio value described as Market Value of Portfolio Equity (“MVPE”) and net interest income. Rate\nshocks assume that current interest rates change immediately and sustain parallel shifts. For interest rate increases or decreases of 100 and 200 basis points, our\npolicy includes a guideline that our MVPE ratio should not decrease more than 10% and 15%, respectively, and that net interest income should not decrease\nmore than 10% and 15%, respectively. As illustrated in the following table, we complied with our asset/liability policy guidelines at June 30, 2024. While our\nmodeling suggests that rate increases of 100 and 200 basis points will have a positive impact on net interest income (as shown in the table below), the actual\namount of such increase cannot be determined, and there can be no assurance any increase will be realized. Because the Company has emphasized variable rate\ninstruments in its loan and investment portfolios, it tends to benefit from higher interest rate environments. As a result of the Federal Reserve rate increases in\n2022 and 2023, net interest income has increased and exceeded prior period levels. Future Federal Reserve rate reductions may result in a return to lower net\ninterest income levels. In April 2024, the Company purchased approximately $900 million of fixed rate commercial and residential mortgage securities of\nvarying maturities to reduce its exposure to lower levels of net interest income should the Federal Reserve begin decreasing rates. Such purchases would also\nreduce the additional net interest income which would result should the Federal Reserve increase rates. Those purchases had respective estimated weighted\naverage yields and lives of approximately 5.11% and eight years.\nNet portfo lio val ue at Net inter est inco me\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\nPercentage Percentage\nRate scenario Amount change Amount change\n(Dollars in thousands)\n+200 basis points $ 1,256,833 (1.61%) $ 414,855 5.12%\n+100 basis points 1,266,378 (0.86%) 404,665 2.54%\nFlat rate 1,277,357 — 394,631 —\n-100 basis points 1,281,042 0.29% 383,905 (2.72%)\n-200 basis points 1,275,811 (0.12%) 373,010 (5.48%)\n56\nFinancial Condition\nGeneral.(cid:0)(cid:3) Our total assets at June 30, 2024 were $8.15 billion, of which our total loans were $5.61 billion, and our commercial loans, at fair value, were\n$265.2 million. At December 31, 2023, our total assets were $7.71 billion, of which our total loans were $5.36 billion, and our commercial loans, at fair value\nwere $332.8 million. The increase in assets reflected an increase in available-for-sale securities, which resulted from the previously discussed $900 million of\nApril 2024 securities purchases. The increase also reflected loan growth in various loan categories, which offset decreases both in SBLOC and IBLOC loan\nbalances and in commercial loans, at fair value as that portfolio continues to run off.\nInterest-earning Deposits\nAt June 30, 2024, we had a total of $399.9 million of interest-earning deposits compared to $1.03 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $633.4 million.\nThese deposits were comprised primarily of balances at the Federal Reserve. The decrease reflected the utilization of these overnight balances for the\naforementioned securities purchases in the second quarter of 2024.\n(cid:0)(cid:3)\nInvestment Portfolio\nFor detailed information on the composition and maturity distribution of our investment portfolio, see “Note 5.

Total investment securities increased to $1.58 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $833.5 million, or 111.5%, from\nDecember 31, 2023, as a result of the aforementioned $900 million of securities purchases in April 2024.\nUnder the accounting guidance related to CECL, changes in fair value of securities unrelated to credit losses continue to be recognized through equity.\nHowever, credit-related losses are recognized through an allowance, rather than through a reduction in the amortized cost of the security. CECL accounting\nguidance also permits the reversal of allowances for credit deterioration in future periods based on improvements in credit, which was not included in previous\nguidance. Generally, a security’s credit-related loss is the difference between its amortized cost basis and the best estimate of its expected future cash flows\ndiscounted at the security’s effective yield. That difference is recognized through the income statement, as with prior guidance, but is renamed a provision for\ncredit loss. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized no credit-related losses on our portfolio.\nInvestments in FHLB, ACBB and Federal Reserve Bank stock are recorded at cost and amounted to $15.6 million at June 30, 2024 and $15.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. Each of these institutions require their correspondent banking institutions to hold stock as a condition of membership. The Bank’s\nconversion to a national charter required the purchase of $11.0 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock in September 2022. Additionally, in the second quarter of\n2023, we joined the FHLB of Des Moines, which required a $9.1 million purchase of stock. While a fixed stock amount is required by each of these institutions,\nthe FHLB stock requirement increases or decreases with the level of borrowing activity.\nAt June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 no investment securities were encumbered, as lines of credit established for borrowings were collateralized by loans.\nThe following table shows the contractual maturity distribution and the weighted average yield of our investment portfolio securities as of June 30, 2024\n(dollars in thousands). The weighted average yield was calculated by dividing the amount of individual securities to total securities in each category,\nmultiplying by the yield of the individual security and adding the results of those individual computations.\nAfter After\nZero one to five to Over\nto one Average five Average ten Average ten Average\nAvailable-for-sale year yield years yield years yield years yield Total\nU.S. Government agency securities $ 719 2.22% $ 7,555 2.74% $ 14,734 5.06% $ 8,349 3.92% $ 31,357\nAsset-backed securities 3,184 6.89% 7,006 7.18% 175,733 7.15% 89,089 7.25% 275,012\nTax-exempt obligations of states and political\nsubdivisions(1) 997 3.10% 1,831 2.65% 1,954 3.87% — — 4,782\nTaxable obligations of states and political\nsubdivisions 10,005 2.94% 25,958 3.30% 1,156 4.33% — — 37,119\nResidential mortgage-backed securities — — 357 2.62% 4,994 4.51% 452,162 5.01% 457,513\nCollateralized mortgage obligation securities — — 4,578 2.73% 15 3.40% 25,340 4.03% 29,933\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities 35,487 2.53% 85,697 3.45% 510,001 4.84% 114,105 4.20% 745,290\nTotal $ 50,392 $ 132,982 $ 708,587 $ 689,045 $ 1,581,006\nWeighted average yield 2.89% 3.54% 5.41% 5.12%\n(1) If adjusted to their taxable equivalents, yields would approximate 3.92%, 3.35%, and 4.90% for zero to one year, one to five years, and five to ten years, respectively, at a federal tax rate of 21%.\n57\nPrior to 2020, the Company sponsored the structuring of commercial mortgage loan securitizations, and in 2020, the Company decided not to pursue additional\nsecuritizations. The loans previously sold to the commercial mortgage-backed securitizations were transitional commercial mortgage loans made to improve\nand rehabilitate existing properties which already had cash flow. Servicing rights were not retained. Each of the securitizations is considered a variable interest\nentity of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Further, true sale accounting has been applicable to each of the securitizations, as supported by a\nreview performed by an independent third-party consultant. In each of the securitizations, the Company obtained a tranche of certificates which are accounted\nfor as available-for-sale debt securities. The securities were recorded at fair value at acquisition, which was determined by an independent third-party based on\nthe discounted cash flow method using unobservable (level 3) inputs.\nOf the six securities purchased by the Bank from our securitizations, all have been repaid except one issued by CRE-2, which is included in the commercial\nmortgage backed securities classification in investment securities. As of June 30, 2024, the principal balance of the Bank’s CRE-2-issued security was\n$12.6 million and it is subordinate to the repayment of a senior tranche with a remaining balance of $1.8 million and servicer advances of $800,000. Thus, a\ntotal of $15.2 million is required for the Bank’s tranche to be repaid. The sole repayment source for the $15.2 million consists of the disposition of a suburban\noffice building in New Jersey and a retail facility in Missouri. In the second quarter of 2024, the Bank received updated appraisals from the servicer for both\nproperties which lowered estimated combined appraised values to $23.7 million. The excess of the $23.7 million appraised values over the $15.2 million to be\nrepaid provides repayment protection for the Bank-owned tranche and accrued interest thereon. As a result of the reduced excess of appraised value over the\nBank’s principal and accruing interest, the $12.6 million principal was placed in nonaccrual status and $1.3 million was reversed from securities interest in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. While the appraised values allocable to the Bank’s security exceed the principal and unpaid interest, there can be no assurance as to the\namounts received upon the servicer’s disposition of these properties, which will reflect additional servicing fees, actual disposition prices and other disposition\ncosts. The servicer’s efforts to resolve the New Jersey suburban office loan and stabilize the property have not been successful to date. Negotiations with the\nborrower continue, with no plan for immediate liquidation. The Missouri retail facility is held as real estate owned by the security’s trust and is also not yet\nstabilized. The special servicer has advised that it is planning to auction the property in the fourth quarter of 2024 based upon their conclusion that such auction\nrepresents the highest net present value option for disposition.\nCommercial Loans, at Fair Value\nCommercial loans, at fair value are comprised of non-SBA commercial real estate loans and SBA loans which had been originated for sale or securitization\nthrough the first quarter of 2020, and which are now being held on the balance sheet. SBA loans are valued on a pooled basis and commercial real estate bridge\nloans are valued individually. Commercial loans, at fair value decreased to $265.2 million at June 30, 2024 from $332.8 million at December 31, 2023,\nprimarily reflecting the impact of loan repayments as this portfolio runs off. These loans continue to be accounted for at fair value. In the third quarter of 2021\nwe resumed originating non-SBA commercial real estate loans, after suspending such originations in the first quarter of 2020. These originations reflect lending\ncriteria similar to the existing loan portfolio and are primarily comprised of multifamily (apartment buildings) collateral. The new originations, which are\nintended to be held for investment, are accounted for at amortized cost.\nLoan Portfolio. Total loans increased to $5.61 billion at June 30, 2024 from $5.36 billion at December 31, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes our loan portfolio, excluding loans held at fair value, by loan category for the periods indicated (in\nthousands):\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBL non-real estate $ 171,893 $ 137,752\nSBL commercial mortgage 647,894 606,986\nSBL construction 30,881 22,627\nSBLs 850,668 767,365\nDirect lease financing 711,403 685,657\nSBLOC / IBLOC(1) 1,558,095 1,627,285\nAdvisor financing(2) 238,831 221,612\nReal estate bridge loans 2,119,324 1,999,782\nConsumer fintech(3) 70,081 —\nOther loans(4) 46,592 50,638\n5,594,994 5,352,339\nUnamortized loan fees and costs 10,733 8,800\nTotal loans, including unamortized loan fees and costs $ 5,605,727 $ 5,361,139\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBLs, including costs net of deferred fees of $9,558 and $9,502\nfor June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively $ 860,226 $ 776,867\nSBLs included in commercial loans, at fair value 104,146 119,287\nTotal SBLs(5) $ 964,372 $ 896,154\n58\n(1) SBLOC are collateralized by marketable securities, while IBLOC, are collateralized by the cash surrender value of insurance policies.

Maximum loan amounts are subject to LTV ratios of\n70% of the business enterprise value based on a third-party valuation, but may be increased depending upon the debt service coverage ratio. Personal guarantees and blanket business liens are obtained\nas appropriate.\n(3) Consumer fintech loans consists primarily of secured credit card loans.\n(4) Includes demand deposit overdrafts reclassified as loan balances totaling $279,000 and $1.7 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

While the value of equities has fallen in excess of\n30% in recent years, the reduction in collateral value of brokerage accounts collateralizing SBLOCs generally has been less. This is because many collateral\naccounts are “balanced” and accordingly, have a component of debt securities, which have either not decreased in value as much as equities, or in some cases\nmay have increased in value. Further, many of these accounts have the benefit of professional investment advisors who provided some protection against\nmarket downturns, through diversification and other means. Additionally, borrowers often utilize only a portion of collateral value, which lowers the percentage\nof principal to the market value of collateral.\nThe following table summarizes our ten largest SBLOC loans as of June 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nPrincipal amount % Principal to collateral\n$ 10,764 17%\n9,465 48%\n8,123 36%\n8,044 68%\n7,905 65%\n7,821 80%\n7,724 24%\n7,544 34%\n7,316 22%\n7,219 44%\nTotal and weighted average $ 81,925 43%\n61\nIBLOC loans are backed by the cash value of life insurance policies which have been assigned to us.

Our Chief Credit Officer oversees the loan review department, which measures the adequacy of the ACL\nindependently of loan production officers. For detailed information on the ACL methodology, see “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial\nstatements herein.\nAt June 30, 2024, the ACL amounted to $28.6 million, which represented a $1.2 million increase compared to the $27.4 million ACL at December 31, 2023.\nThe increase reflected the impact of higher leasing net charge-offs.\nA description of loan review coverage targets is set forth below.\nThe following loan review percentages are performed over periods of eighteen to twenty-four months. At June 30, 2024, in excess of 50% of the total loan\nportfolio was reviewed by the loan review department or, for SBLs, rated internally by that department. In addition to the review of all loans classified as either\nspecial mention or substandard, the targeted coverages and scope of the reviews are risk-based and vary according to each portfolio as follows:\nSBLOC – The targeted review threshold is 40%, including a sample focusing on the largest 25% of SBLOCs by commitment. A random sample of at least\ntwenty loans will be reviewed each quarter. At June 30, 2024, approximately 47% of the SBLOC portfolio had been reviewed.\nIBLOC – The targeted review threshold is 40%, including a sample focusing on the largest 25% of IBLOCs by commitment. A random sample of at least twenty\nloans will be reviewed each quarter. At June 30, 2024, approximately 58% of the IBLOC portfolio had been reviewed.\n63\nAdvisor Financing – The targeted review threshold is 50%. At June 30, 2024, approximately 94% of the advisor financing portfolio had been reviewed. The\nloan balance review threshold is $1.0 million.\nSBLs – The targeted review threshold is 60%, to be rated and/or reviewed within 90 days of funding, excluding fully guaranteed loans purchased for CRA\npurposes, and fully guaranteed PPP loans. The loan balance review threshold is $1.5 million and additionally includes any classified loans. At June 30, 2024,\napproximately 73% of the non-government guaranteed SBL loan portfolio had been reviewed.\nDirect Lease Financing – The targeted review threshold is 35%. At June 30, 2024, approximately 51% of the leasing portfolio had been reviewed. The loan\nbalance review threshold is $1.5 million.\nCommercial Real Estate Bridge Loans, at fair value and Commercial Real Estate Bridge Loans, at amortized cost (floating rate, excluding SBA, which are\nincluded in SBLs above) – The targeted review threshold is 60%. Floating rate loans will be reviewed initially within 90 days of funding and will be monitored\non an ongoing basis as to payment status. Subsequent reviews will be performed for relationships over $10.0 million. At June 30, 2024, approximately 100% of\nthe floating rate, non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans outstanding for more than 90 days had been reviewed.\nCommercial Real Estate Loans, at fair value (fixed rate, excluding SBA, which are included in SBLs above) – The targeted review threshold is 100%. At June\n30, 2024, approximately 100% of the fixed rate, non-SBA commercial real estate loan portfolio had been reviewed.\nOther minor loan categories are reviewed at the discretion of the loan review department.\nThe following tables present delinquencies by type of loan as of the dates specified (in thousands):\nJ une 30, 2024\n30-59 days 60-89 days 90+ days Total Total\npast due past due still accruing Non-accrual past due Current loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 78 $ 311 $ 764 $ 2,448 $ 3,601 $ 168,292 $ 171,893\nSBL commercial mortgage — 336 — 5,211 5,547 642,347 647,894\nSBL construction — — — 3,385 3,385 27,496 30,881\nDirect lease financing 4,575 4,415 2,224 3,870 15,084 696,319 711,403\nSBLOC / IBLOC 12,448 2,101 1,284 — 15,833 1,542,262 1,558,095\nAdvisor financing — — — — — 238,831 238,831\nReal estate bridge loans(1) — 12,300 — — 12,300 2,107,024 2,119,324\nConsumer fintech — — — — — 70,081 70,081\nOther loans 96 — 4 — 100 46,492 46,592\nUnamortized loan fees and costs — — — — — 10,733 10,733\n$ 17,197 $ 19,463 $ 4,276 $ 14,914 $ 55,850 $ 5,549,877 $ 5,605,727\nD ec ember 31, 2023\n30-59 days 60-89 days 90+ days Total Total\npast due past due still accruing Non-accrual past due Current loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 84 $ 333 $ 336 $ 1,842 $ 2,595 $ 135,157 $ 137,752\nSBL commercial mortgage 2,183 — — 2,381 4,564 602,422 606,986\nSBL construction — — — 3,385 3,385 19,242 22,627\nDirect lease financing 5,163 1,209 485 3,785 10,642 675,015 685,657\nSBLOC / IBLOC 21,934 3,607 745 — 26,286 1,600,999 1,627,285\nAdvisor financing — — — — — 221,612 221,612\nReal estate bridge loans — — — — — 1,999,782 1,999,782\nConsumer fintech — — — — — — —\nOther loans 853 76 178 132 1,239 49,399 50,638\nUnamortized loan fees and costs — — — — — 8,800 8,800\n$ 30,217 $ 5,225 $ 1,744 $ 11,525 $ 48,711 $ 5,312,428 $ 5,361,139\n(1) Borrowers for a $12.3 million apartment property real estate bridge loan which had a six month payment deferral granted in the fourth quarter of 2023 have not resumed payments and are reflected\nin the 60-89 days past due column in the table above. The related “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs based on a May 2024 appraisal were 72% and 56%, respectively. The “as stabilized” loan to value\nmeasures the apartment property’s value after renovations have been completed and units have generally been released. The Company originated a new loan with a new borrower for a previously\nreported $9.5 million REBL loan that was 60 to 89 days delinquent at March 31, 2024. The new borrower is expected to have greater financial capacity to complete the related project and has\nnegotiated three quarters of payment deferrals and a lower rate. The “as stabilized” LTV is approximately 78% after considering additional estimated future fundings to complete renovations. The\naforementioned LTVs are based on third party appraisals performed within the past year.\nAlthough we consider our ACL to be adequate based on information currently available, future additions to the ACL may be necessary due to changes in\neconomic conditions, our ongoing loss experience and that of our peers, changes in management’s assumptions as to\n64\nfuture delinquencies, recoveries and losses, deterioration of specific credits and management’s intent with regard to the disposition of loans and leases.\nThe following table summarizes select asset quality ratios for each of the periods indicated:\nFor the six mo nths ended For the year ended\nor as of June 30, or as of December 31,\n2024 2023 2023\nRatio of:\nACL to total loans 0.51% 0.44% 0.51%\nACL to non-performing loans(1) 148.91% 159.59% 206.33%\nNon-performing loans to total loans(1) 0.34% 0.28% 0.25%\nNon-performing assets to total assets(1) 0.95% 0.47% 0.39%\nNet charge-offs to average loans 0.05% 0.03% 0.07%\n(1)Includes loans 90 days past due still accruing interest.\nThe ratio of the ACL to total loans increased to 0.51% as of June 30, 2024 from 0.44% at June 30, 2023 as the ACL increased proportionately more than total\nloans. The $5.3 million increase in the ACL between those dates, reflected approximately $1.0 million of increased reserves on specific distressed credits and\napproximately $1.0 million which was added in fourth quarter 2023 for a qualitative factor for an increasing trend in substandard real estate bridge loans\nAdditionally, while reserves for SBLOC and IBLOC loans were reduced as a result of lower loan balances, the related reserve impact was more than offset by\ngrowth in other loan categories with higher ACL allocations. The lower reserve allocations for SBLOC and IBLOC reflect their respective marketable securities\nand cash value of insurance collateral. The ratio of the ACL to non-performing loans decreased to 148.91% at June 30, 2024, from 159.59% at June 30, 2023,\nprimarily as a result of the increase in non-performing loans which proportionately exceeded the increase in the ACL. As a result of the increase in non-\nperforming loans, the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans also increased to 0.34% at June 30, 2024 from 0.28% at June 30, 2023. The ratio of non-\nperforming assets to total assets increased to 0.95% at June 30, 2024 from 0.47% at June 30, 2023, reflecting the increase in non-performing loans, and a $39.4\nmillion loan transferred to OREO in the second quarter of 2024. The Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the apartment property\ncollateralizing that loan, and, at June 30, 2024, the related $39.4 million balance, comprised the majority of our OREO. The purchaser made an earnest money\ndeposit of $125,000 in July 2024, with additional required deposits projected to total $500,000 prior to the December 31, 2024 closing deadline. The sales price\nis expected to cover the Company’s current OREO balance plus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property. There can be no assurance that the\npurchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, it is expected that earnest money deposits would accrue to the Company The ratio\nof net charge-offs to average loans was 0.05% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 0.03% for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase\nreflected an increase in direct lease financing net charge-offs.\nNet Charge-offs\nNet charge-offs were $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $927,000 from net charge-offs of $1.7 million during the six months\nended June 30, 2023. Charge-offs in both periods resulted primarily from non-real estate SBL and leasing charge-offs. SBL charge-offs resulted primarily from\nthe non-government guaranteed portion of SBA loans.\nThe following tables reflect the relationship of year-to-date average loans outstanding, based upon quarter end averages, and net charge-offs by loan category\n(dollars in thousands):\nJu ne 30, 2024\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor Real estate Consumer\nestate mortgage construction financing IBLOC financing bridge loans fintech Other loans\nCharge-offs $ 417 $ — $ — $ 2,301 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 16\nRecoveries (32) — — (59) — — — — —\nNet charge-offs $ 385 $ — $ — $ 2,242 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 16\nAverage loan balance $ 150,200 $ 630,935 $ 26,933 $ 699,857 $ 1,578,564 $ 230,883 $ 2,073,667 $ 23,360 $ 51,131\nRatio of net charge-offs\nduring the period to average\nloans during the period 0.26% — — 0.32% — — — — 0.03%\n65\nJu ne 30, 2023\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor Real estate Consumer\nestate mortgage construction financing IBLOC financing bridge loans fintech Other loans\nCharge-offs $ 871 $ — $ — $ 1,439 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 3\nRecoveries (298) (75) — (175) — — — — (49)\nNet charge-offs (recoveries)$ 573 $ (75) $ — $ 1,264 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ (46)\nAverage loan balance $ 113,636 $ 494,101 $ 32,150 $ 647,339 $ 2,089,842 $ 178,423 $ 1,749,194 $ — $ 59,178\nRatio of net charge-offs\nduring the period to average\nloans during the period 0.50% — — 0.20% — — — — —\nWe review charge-offs at least quarterly in loan surveillance meetings which include the chief credit officer, the loan review department and other senior credit\nofficers in a process which includes identifying any trends or other factors impacting portfolio management. In recent periods charge-offs have been primarily\ncomprised of the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7a loans and leases. The charge-offs have resulted from individual borrower or business circumstances as\nopposed to overall trends or other factors.\nNon-accrual Loans, Loans 90 Days Delinquent and Still Accruing, OREO and Modified Loans.\nLoans are considered to be non-performing if they are on a non-accrual basis or they are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. A loan which is\npast due 90 days or more and still accruing interest remains on accrual status only when it is both adequately secured as to principal and interest, and is in the\nprocess of collection. We had $57.9 million of OREO at June 30, 2024 and $16.9 million of OREO at December 31, 2023. The following tables summarize our\nnon-performing loans, OREO, and loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest.\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNon-accrual loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 2,448 $ 1,842\nSBL commercial mortgage 5,211 2,381\nSBL construction 3,385 3,385\nDirect leasing 3,870 3,785\nOther loans — 132\nTotal non-accrual loans 14,914 11,525\nLoans past due 90 days or more and still accruing(1) 4,276 1,744\nTotal non-performing loans 19,190 13,269\nOREO(2) 57,861 16,949\nTotal non-performing assets $ 77,051 $ 30,218\n(1) The majority of the increase in Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing resulted from vehicle leases to governmental entities and municipalities, the payments for which are sometimes\nsubject to administrative delays, and IBLOC loans which are secured by the cash value of life insurance.\n(2) In the first quarter of 2024, a $39.4 million apartment building rehabilitation bridge loan was transferred to nonaccrual status. On April 2, 2024, the same loan was transferred from nonaccrual status\nto OREO. We intend to continue to manage the capital improvements on the underlying apartment complex. As the units become available for lease, the property manager will be tasked with leasing\nthese units at market rents. The $39.4 million loan balance compares to a September 2023 third party “as is” appraisal of $47.8 million, or an 82% “as is” loan to value (“LTV”), with additional\npotential collateral value as construction progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental rates. The Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for that apartment property acquired by\nThe Bancorp Bank through foreclosure. At June 30, 2024, the related $39.4 million balance, comprised the majority of our OREO. The purchaser made an earnest money deposit of $125,000 in July\n2024, with additional required deposits projected to total $500,000 prior to the December 31, 2024, closing deadline. The sales price is expected to cover the Company’s current OREO balance plus\nthe forecasted cost of improvements to the property. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, earnest money deposits are\nexpected to accrue to the Company. The nonaccrual balances in this table as of June 30, 2024, are also reflected in the substandard loan totals.\nFor the three month and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, loans modified and related information are as follows (dollars in\nthousands):\nThree m on ths ended June 3 0, 20 24 Thre e m on ths ended June 30 , 2 02 3\nPayment delay as Interest rate Payment delay as\na result of a reduction and Percent of total a result of a Percent of total\npayment deferral payment deferral Term extension Total loan category payment deferral Total loan category\nSBL non-real estate $ — $ — $ — $ — — $ 156 $ 156 0.13%\nSBL commercial mortgage — — — — — — — —\nDirect lease financing — — 2,551 2,551 0.36% — — —\nReal estate bridge loans — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ — $ — $ 2,551 $ 2,551 0.05% $ 156 $ 156 —\n66\nSix m o nth s ended June 30 , 2 02 4 Six mo nt hs ended June 30, 20 23\nPayment delay as Interest rate Payment delay as\na result of a reduction and Percent of total a result of a Percent of total\npayment deferral payment deferral Term extension Total loan category payment deferral Total loan category\nSBL non-real estate $ 1,726 $ — $ — $ 1,726 1.00% $ 156 $ 156 0.13%\nSBL commercial mortgage 3,320 — — 3,320 0.51% — — —\nDirect lease financing — — 2,551 2,551 0.36% — — —\nReal estate bridge loans(1) 26,923 32,500 — 59,423 2.80% — — —\nTotal $ 31,969 $ 32,500 $ 2,551 $ 67,020 1.20% $ 156 $ 156 —\n(1) For the period ended June 30, 2024, the “as is” weighted average LTV of the real estate bridge lending balances was less than 72.5%, and the “as stabilized” LTV was approximately 68% based\nupon recent appraisals. “As stabilized” LTVs reflect the third-party appraiser’s estimated value after the rehabilitation is complete.

Substantially all of the reserves at June 30, 2024 related to the non-\nguaranteed portion of SBA loans.\n67\nThe following table describes the financial effect of the modifications made for the three month and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023\n(dollars in thousands):\nT hre e m onths ended June 30 , 20 24 T hre e m onths ended June 30 , 20 23\nCombined Rate and Maturity Combined Rate and Maturity\nWeighted average More-Than- Weighted average More-Than-\nWeighted average term extension (in Insignificant- Weighted average term extension (in Insignificant-\ninterest reduction months) Payment Delay interest reduction months) Payment Delay(2)\nSBL non-real estate — — — — — 0.13%\nSBL commercial mortgage — — — — — —\nDirect lease financing — 12.0 — — — —\nReal estate bridge loans — — — — — —\nSix m onths ended June 30, 202 4 Six mo nths ended June 30, 202 3\nCombined Rate and Maturity Combined Rate and Maturity\nWeighted average More-Than- Weighted average More-Than-\nWeighted average term extension (in Insignificant- Weighted average term extension (in Insignificant-\ninterest reduction months) Payment Delay(2) interest reduction months) Payment Delay(2)\nSBL non-real estate — — 1.00% — — 0.13%\nSBL commercial mortgage — — 0.51% — — —\nDirect lease financing — 12.0 — — — —\nReal estate bridge loans(1) 1.68% — 1.27% — — —\n(1) For the period ended June 30, 2024, the “as is” weighted average LTV of the real estate bridge lending balances was less than 72.5%, and the “as stabilized” LTV was approximately 68% based\nupon recent appraisals. “As stabilized” LTVs reflect the third-party appraiser’s estimated value after the rehabilitation is complete. On each property reflected in the balances, apartment improvements\nand renovations continue, utilizing additional borrower capital. The balances for both periods were also classified as either special mention or substandard as of June 30, 2024.\n(2) Percentage represents the principal of loans deferred divided by the principal of the total loan portfolio.\nThere were no loans that received a term extension modification that had a payment default during the period and were modified in the twelve months before\ndefault.\nWe had no commitments to extend additional credit to loans classified as modified as of June 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nWe had $14.9 million of non-accrual loans at June 30, 2024, compared to $11.5 million of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2023. The $3.4 million increase in\nnon-accrual loans was primarily due to $50.6 million of additions partially offset by $42.0 million transferred to OREO, $2.5 million of charge-offs, $1.1\nmillion transferred to repossessed vehicle inventory, $1.5 million of payments and $129,000 returned to accrual status. Loans past due 90 days or more still\naccruing interest amounted to $4.3 at June 30, 2024 and $1.7 million at December 31, 2023. The $2.5 million increase reflected $7.8 million of additions\npartially offset by $5.2 million of loan payments and $24,000 transferred to non-accrual loans.\nWe had $57.9 million of OREO at June 30, 2024 and $16.9 million of OREO at December 31, 2023. The change in balance reflected $42.0 million transferred\nfrom non-accrual loans.\nWe evaluate loans under an internal loan risk rating system as a means of identifying problem loans. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, classified loans\nwere segregated by year of origination and are shown in “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein.\nPremises and Equipment, Net\nPremises and equipment amounted to $28.0 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $27.5 million at December 31, 2023.\nOther assets\nOther assets amounted to $149.2 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $133.1 million at December 31, 2023.\nDeposits\nOur primary source of funding is deposit acquisition. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms, including demand, checking\nand money market accounts, through and with the assistance of affinity groups. The majority of our deposits\n68\nare generated through prepaid card and debit and other payments related deposit accounts. At June 30, 2024, we had total deposits of $7.16 billion compared to\n$6.68 billion at December 31, 2023, which reflected an increase of $474.8 million, or 7.1%. Daily deposit balances are subject to variability, and deposits\naveraged $6.72 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Savings and money market balances are a modest percentage of our funding and we have swept such\ndeposits off our balance sheet to other institutions. Such sweeps are utilized to optimize diversity within our funding structure by managing the percentage of\nindividual client deposits to total deposits. A diversified group of prepaid and debit card accounts, which have an established history of stability and lower cost\nthan certain other types of funding, comprise the majority of our deposits. Our product mix includes prepaid card accounts for salary, medical spending,\ncommercial, general purpose reloadable, corporate and other incentive, gift, government payments and transaction accounts accessed by debit cards. Balances\nare subject to daily fluctuations, which may comprise a significant component of variances between dates. Our funding is comprised primarily of millions of\nsmall transaction-based consumer balances, the vast majority of which are FDIC-insured. We have multi-year, contractual relationships with affinity groups\nwhich sponsor such accounts and with whom we have had long-term relationships (see Item 1. “Business—Our Strategies” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023). Those long-term relationships comprise the majority of our deposits while we continue to grow and add new client\nrelationships. Of our deposits at June 30, 2024, the top three affinity groups accounted for approximately $2.79 billion, the next three largest $1.54 billion, and\nthe four subsequent largest $862.2 million. Of our deposits at year-end 2023, the top three affinity groups accounted for approximately $2.33 billion, the next\nthree largest $1.46 billion, and the four subsequent largest $852.1 million. While certain of these relationships may have changed their ranking in the top ten,\nthe affinity groups themselves were generally identical at both dates, with some movement in the ninth and tenth largest relationships. We believe that payroll,\ndebit, and government-based accounts such as child support are comparable to traditional consumer checking accounts. Such balances in the top ten\nrelationships at June 30, 2024 totaled $3.15 billion while balances related to consumer and business payment companies, including companies sponsoring\nincentive payments, amounted to $2.04 billion. Such balances in the top ten relationships at year-end 2023, totaled $2.91 billion while balances related to\nconsumer and business payment companies, including companies sponsoring incentive and gift card payments, amounted to $1.72 billion. We pay interest\ndirectly to consumer account holders for an immaterial amount of deposit balances, while the vast majority of interest expense results from fees paid to affinity\ngroups. The vast majority of such payments are variable rate and equate to varying contractual percentages tied to the effective federal funds rate, which results\nfrom Federal Reserve rate hikes and reductions. The effective federal funds rate also reflects a market rate which might be required to replace lower cost\ndeposits, or fund loan growth in excess of deposit growth, at least in the short-term. Because underlying balances have generally exhibited stability, so too have\ntrends in the cost of funds. The more consequential impact to cost of funds are market changes and the effective federal funds rate, specifically the impact of\nFederal Reserve rate hikes and reductions. We model significant fee-based relationships in our net interest income sensitivity modeling (see “Asset and Liability\nManagement”). The following discussion is applicable to our transaction accounts, comprising the majority of our deposits, in the 100 and 200 basis point rate\nincrease and decrease scenarios as presented in the applicable table in that Asset and Liability Management section. The impact of the Federal Reserve rate\nhikes or reductions, which respectively increase or decrease interest expense, has approximated the ratio of our cost of funds divided by the effective federal\nfunds rate, all else equal. However, there can be no assurance that such ratios could not change significantly given the other variables discussed in the Asset and\nLiability Management section. In second quarter 2024, our demand and interest checking balances averaged $6.66 billion, compared to $6.40 billion in second\nquarter 2023. The growth primarily reflected increases in payment company balances. Average savings and money market balances decreased to $60.2 million\nthe second quarter of 2024, compared to $78.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. We sweep deposits off our balance sheet to other institutions to optimize\ndiversity within our funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to total deposits. Short-term time deposits have been used\nminimally to provide liquidity cushions, for instance when short-term loan origination exceeds short-term deposit growth, as was the case in 2022. In 2023, we\ndid not use short-term time deposits after the first quarter of the year. Short-term time deposits are generated through established intermediaries such as banks\nand other financial companies. These deposits generally originate with investment or trust companies or banks, which offer those deposits at market rates to\nFDIC-insured institutions, such that the balances are fully FDIC-insured. These deposits are generally classified as brokered. While affinity groups may decide\nto pay interest or other remuneration to account holders, they do not currently do so for the vast majority of balances. The following table presents the average\nbalance and rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThe following table presents the average balance and rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nFor the six m ont hs ended For the ye ar e nded\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\nbalance rate balance rate\nDemand and interest checking(1) $ 6,553,107 2.39% $ 6,308,509 2.30%\nSavings and money market 55,591 3.25% 78,074 3.66%\nTime — — 20,794 4.13%\nTotal deposits $ 6,608,698 2.40% $ 6,407,377 2.32%\n(1) Of the amounts shown for 2024 and 2023, $152.8 million and $177.0 million, respectively, represented balances on which the Bank paid interest. The remaining balance for each period reflects\namounts subject to fees paid to third parties, which are based upon a contractual percentage applied to a rate index, generally the effective federal funds rate, and therefore classified as interest expense.\n69\nShort-term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings consist of amounts borrowed on our lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank or FHLB. There were no borrowings on either line at\nJune 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. We generally utilize overnight borrowings to manage our daily reserve requirements at the Federal Reserve. Period-end\nand year-to-date information for the dates shown is as follows.\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nShort-term borrowings\nBalance at period end $ — $ —\nAverage for the three months ended June 30, 2024 92,412 N/A\nAverage during the year 46,892 5,739\nMaximum month-end balance 125,000 450,000\nWeighted average rate during the period 5.60% 4.72%\nRate at period end — —\nSenior Debt\nOn August 13, 2020, we issued $100.0 million of the 2025 Senior Notes, with a maturity date of August 15, 2025, and a 4.75% interest rate, with interest paid\nsemi-annually on March 15 and September 15. The 2025 Senior Notes are the Company’s direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equal in\npriority with all our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all our existing and future subordinated\nindebtedness. In lieu of repayment of debt from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company, industry practice includes the issuance of new debt to repay\nmaturing debt.\nBorrowings\nAt June 30, 2024, we had other long-term borrowings of $38.3 million compared to $38.6 million at December 31, 2023. The borrowings consisted of sold\nloans which were accounted for as a secured borrowing because they did not qualify for true sale accounting. We do not have any policy prohibiting us from\nincurring debt.\nThe 2038 Debentures, which total $13.4 million, mature in March 2038 and bear interest at SOFR plus 3.51%, are grandfathered to qualify as tier 1 capital at\nthe Bank.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities amounted to $65.0 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $69.6 million at December 31, 2023.\nShareholders’ Equity\nAs a means of returning capital to shareholders, the Company implemented stock repurchase programs which totaled $40.0 million, $60.0 million and $100.0\nmillion, in equal quarterly amounts, respectively, in 2021, 2022 and 2023, with $200 million originally planned for 2024. Subsequently, the second quarter 2024\nplanned repurchase was increased from $50 million to $100 million, with $50 million in repurchases planned for each remaining quarter of 2024. The planned\namounts of such repurchases are generally determined in the fourth quarter of the preceding year by assessing the impact of budgetary earnings projections on\nregulatory capital requirements. The excess of projected earnings over amounts required to maintain capital requirements is the maximum available for capital\nreturn to shareholders, barring any need to retain capital for other purposes. A significant portion of such excess earnings has been utilized for stock repurchases\nin the amounts noted above, while cash dividends have not been paid. In determining whether capital is returned through stock repurchases or cash dividends,\nthe Company calculates a maximum share repurchase price, based upon comparisons with what it concludes to be other exemplar peer share price valuations,\nwith further consideration of internal growth projections. As these share prices, which are updated at least annually, have not been reached, capital return has\nconsisted solely of stock repurchases. Exemplar share price comparisons are based upon multiples of earnings per share over time, with further consideration of\nreturns on equity and assets. While repurchase amounts are planned in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, repurchases may be modified or terminated at\nany time, should capital need to be conserved.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nThere were no off-balance sheet arrangements during the six months ended June 30, 2024 that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on\nour financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is\nmaterial to our interests.\n70\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInformation about market risk for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 is included under “Asset and Liability Management” in Part I, Item 2. “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except for such information, there has been\nno material change to our assessment of our sensitivity to market risk as discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nAs noted under “Asset and Liability Management” in Part I, Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk is managed through the use of guidelines which limit interest rate exposure\nto higher interest rates. Because the Company has emphasized variable rate instruments in its loan and investment portfolios, it tends to benefit from higher\ninterest rate environments. As a result of the Federal Reserve rate increases in 2022 and 2023, net interest income has increased and exceeded prior period\nlevels. While future Federal Reserve rate reductions may result in lower net interest income, such exposure to lower rates was significantly reduced in the third\nquarter of 2024 with the purchase of fixed rate securities. In addition to the aforementioned guidelines which the Company uses to manage interest rate risk, the\nCompany utilizes an asset liability committee to provide oversight by multiple departments and senior officers.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified\nin the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our\nprincipal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not\nabsolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.\nUnder the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of June 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter\nended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n71\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFor a discussion of our material pending legal proceedings, see “Note 13. Legal” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A.\n“Risk Factors” in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nStock Repurchases\nOn October 26, 2023, the Board approved the 2024 Repurchase Program, which authorizes the Company to repurchase $50.0 million in value of the Company’s\ncommon stock per fiscal quarter in 2024, for a maximum amount of $200.0 million. The Company increased its share repurchase authorization for the second\nquarter of 2024 from $50.0 million to $100.0 million, which increased the maximum amount under the 2024 Repurchase Program to $250.0 million. Under the\n2024 Repurchase Program, the Company intends to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or\notherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The 2024 Repurchase Program may be modified or\nterminated at any time. With respect to further repurchases in subsequent quarters under this program, the Company cannot predict if, or when, it will\nrepurchase any shares of common stock and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of\nmarket conditions and other factors.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company’s repurchases of its common stock during the quarter ended June 30, 2024:\nTotal number of\nshares purchased as Approximate dollar\npart of publicly value of shares that may\nTotal number of Average price paid per announced plans or yet be purchased under\nPeriod shares purchased share programs(1) the plans or programs(2)\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nApril 1, 2024 - April 30, 2024 528,354 $ 32.31 528,354 $ 182,929\nMay 1, 2024 - May 31, 2024 1,413,616 33.01 1,413,616 136,259\nJune 1, 2024 -June 30, 2024 1,076,435 33.68 1,076,435 100,000\nTotal 3,018,405 33.13 3,018,405 100,000\n(1) During the second quarter of 2024, all shares of common stock were repurchased pursuant to the 2024 Repurchase Program, which was approved by the Board on October 26, 2023 and publicly\nannounced on October 26, 2023. Under the 2024 Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock totaling up to $50.0 million per quarter, for a maximum\namount of $200.0 million in 2024. The Company increased its share repurchase authorization for the second quarter of 2024 from $50.0 million to $100.0 million, which increased the maximum\namount under the 2024 Repurchase Program to $250.0 million. The Company may repurchase shares through open market purchases, including through written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 under\nthe Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act.\n(2) The 2024 Repurchase Program may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time and had an expiration date of December 31, 2024. With respect to further repurchases, the Company cannot\npredict if, or when, it will repurchase any shares of common stock, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market\nconditions and other factors.\nItem 5. Other Information\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated a\n“Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as those terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\n72\nItem 6.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Organization and Nature of Operations\nThe Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation and a registered financial holding company. Its primary, wholly-owned subsidiary is The\nBancorp Bank, National Association (the “Bank”). The Bank is a nationally chartered commercial bank located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and is a Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured institution. As a nationally chartered bank, its primary regulator is the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (“OCC”). The Bank has two primary lines of business consisting of its national specialty finance segment and its payments segment.\nIn the national specialty finance segment, the Bank makes the following types of loans: securities-backed lines of credit (“SBLOCs”), cash value of insurance-\nbacked lines of credit (“IBLOCs”) and investment advisor financing; leases (direct lease financing); small business loans (“SBLs”), consisting primarily of\nSmall Business Administration (“SBA”) loans; and non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans (“REBLs”). Consumer fintech lending is reflected in the\npayments segment.\nWhile the national specialty finance segment generates the majority of the Company’s revenues, the payments segment also contributes significant revenues. In\nits payments segment, the Company provides payment and deposit services nationally, which include prepaid and debit card accounts, affinity group banking,\ndeposit accounts to investment advisors’ customers, card payments and other payment processing services. Payments segment deposits fund the majority of the\nCompany’s loans and securities and may produce lower costs than other funding sources. Most of the payments segment’s revenues and deposits, and SBLOC\nand IBLOC loans, result from relationships with third parties which market such products. Concentrations of loans and deposits are based upon the cumulative\naccount balances generated by those third parties. Similar concentrations result in revenues in prepaid, debit card and related fees. These concentrations may\nalso be reflected in a lower cost of funds compared to other funding sources. The Company sweeps certain deposits off its balance sheet to other institutions\nthrough intermediaries. Such sweeps are utilized to optimize diversity within its funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to\ntotal deposits.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to regulation by certain state and federal agencies and, accordingly, they are examined periodically by those regulatory\nauthorities. As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities, the Company’s and the Bank’s businesses are affected by state and\nfederal legislation and regulations.\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements of the Company, as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are\nunaudited. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). However, in the opinion of management, these interim financial statements include all\nnecessary adjustments to fairly present the results of the interim periods presented. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023\nForm 10-K”). The results of operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for\nthe full year ending December 31, 2024.\nThere have been no significant changes as of September 30, 2024 from the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nNote 3. Stock-based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 718 Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). The fair value of the option or RSU is generally measured at fair\nvalue at the grant date with compensation expense recognized over the service period, which is typically the stated vesting period. For option grants subject to a\nservice condition, the Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of such options on the date of grant. The Black-\nScholes model takes into consideration the exercise price and expected life of the options, the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility,\nthe expected dividends on the stock and the current risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the option. The Company’s estimate of the fair value of a stock\noption is based on expectations derived from historical experience and may not necessarily equate to its market value when fully vested. In accordance with\nASC 718, the Company estimates the number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. At September 30, 2024, the Company had\nthree active stock-based compensation plans.\n9\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 45,616 stock options with a vesting period of four years and a weighted average\ngrant-date fair value of $21.92. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company granted 57,573 stock options with a vesting period of four\nyears and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $17.37. There were no common stock options exercised in the nine-month period ended September 30,\n2024. There were 13,158 stock options exercised in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.\nA summary of the Company’s stock options is presented below.\nWeighted average\nremaining\nWeighted average contractual Aggregate\nOptions exercise price term (years) intrinsic value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 622,677 $ 15.35 6.90 $ 14,453,641\nGranted 45,616 43.89 9.37 —\nExercised — — — —\nExpired — — — —\nForfeited — — — —\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 668,293 $ 17.30 6.37 $ 24,194,806\nExercisable at September 30, 2024 504,497 $ 12.00 5.83 $ 20,938,696\nThe Company granted 390,305 RSUs in the first nine months of 2024, of which 355,965 have a vesting period of three years and 34,340 have a vesting period\nof one year. At issuance, the 390,305 RSUs granted in the first nine months of 2024 had a weighted average fair value of $42.87 per unit. The Company granted\n547,556 RSUs in the first nine months of 2023, of which 514,785 had a vesting period of three years and 32,771 had a vesting period of one year. At issuance,\nthe 547,556 RSUs granted in the first nine months of 2023 had a weighted average fair value of $35.00 per unit.\nA summary of the Company’s RSUs is presented below.\nWeighted average Average remaining\ngrant date contractual\nRSUs fair value term (years)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 752,255 $ 32.53 1.66\nGranted 390,305 42.87 2.21\nVested (345,390) 30.39 —\nForfeited — — —\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 797,170 $ 38.27 1.68\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was a total of $23.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards under stock-based compensation\nplans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.5 years. Related compensation expense for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $3.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Related compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 was $11.0 million and $8.7 million, respectively. The total issuance date fair value of RSUs vested and options exercised during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $10.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised and RSUs vested in\nthose respective periods was $14.8 million and $16.8 million, respectively.\nFor the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company estimated the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the\nBlack-Scholes options pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nRisk-free interest rate 4.17% 3.67%\nExpected dividend yield — —\nExpected volatility 44.76% 45.21%\nExpected lives (years) 6.3 6.3\nExpected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock and peer group comparisons over the expected life of the option. The risk-free\nrate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities\n(“STRIPS”) rate in effect at the time of the grant. The life of the option is based on historical factors which include the contractual term, vesting period, exercise\nbehavior and employee terminations. In accordance with ASC 718, stock- based compensation expense for the period ended September 30, 2024 is based on\nawards that are ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates forfeitures using historical data or acceptable\nexpedients.\n10\nNote 4. Earnings Per Share\nThe Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by\ndividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into\naccount the potential dilution that could occur if securities, including stock options and RSUs or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and\nconverted into common stock. Stock options are dilutive if their exercise prices are less than the current stock price. RSUs are dilutive because they represent\ngrants over vesting periods which do not require employees to pay exercise prices. The dilution shown in the tables below includes the potential dilution from\nboth stock options and RSUs.\nThe following tables show the Company’s earnings per share for the periods presented:\nFor the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nIncome Shares Per share\n(numerator) (denominator) amount\n(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)\nBasic earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 51,517 48,759,369 $ 1.06\nEffect of dilutive securities\nCommon stock options and RSUs — 718,867 (0.02)\nDiluted earnings per share\nNet earnings available to common shareholders $ 51,517 49,478,236 $ 1.04\nStock options for 622,677 shares, exercisable at prices between $6.87 and $35.17 per share, were outstanding at September 30, 2024, and included in the diluted\nearnings per share computation because their exercise price per share was less than the average market price for the three month period ended September 30,\n2024.

Investment Securities\nFair values of available-for-sale securities are based on the fair market values supplied by a third-party market data provider, or where such third-party market\ndata is not available, fair values are based on discounted cash flows. The third-party market data provider uses a pricing matrix which it creates daily, taking\ninto consideration actual trade data, projected prepayments, and when relevant, projected credit defaults and losses.\nThe amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair values of the Company’s investment securities classified as available-for-sale at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\nAvailable-for-sale September 30, 2024\nGross Gross Allowance\nAmortized unrealized unrealized for Fair\ncost gains losses Credit Losses value\nU.S. Government agency securities $ 31,622 $ 114 $ (718) $ — $ 31,018\nAsset-backed securities(1) 236,794 157 (27) — 236,924\nTax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions 7,860 97 (26) — 7,931\nTaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions 35,366 12 (371) — 35,007\nResidential mortgage-backed securities 448,761 18,536 (3,689) — 463,608\nCollateralized mortgage obligation securities 29,433 — (940) — 28,493\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities 775,393 21,544 (11,629) — 785,308\nCorporate debt securities 10,000 — — (10,000) —\n$ 1,575,229 $ 40,460 $ (17,400) $ (10,000) $ 1,588,289\nSeptemb er 3 0, 2 024\nGross Gross\nAmortized unrealized unrealized Fair\n(1)Asset-backed securities as shown above cost gains losses value\nFederally insured student loan securities $ 2,754 $ — $ (6) $ 2,748\nCollateralized loan obligation securities 234,040 157 (21) 234,176\n$ 236,794 $ 157 $ (27) $ 236,924\nAvailable-for-sale December 31, 2023\nGross Gross Allowance\nAmortized unrealized unrealized for Fair\ncost gains losses Credit Losses value\nU.S. Government agency securities $ 35,346 $ 6 $ (1,466) $ — $ 33,886\nAsset-backed securities(1) 327,159 9 (1,815) — 325,353\nTax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions 4,860 39 (48) — 4,851\nTaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions 43,323 15 (952) — 42,386\nResidential mortgage-backed securities 169,882 108 (9,223) — 160,767\nCollateralized mortgage obligation securities 35,575 — (1,537) — 34,038\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities 157,759 — (11,506) — 146,253\nCorporate debt securities 10,000 — — (10,000) —\n$ 783,904 $ 177 $ (26,547) $ (10,000) $ 747,534\n12\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Gross\nAmortized unrealized unrealized Fair\n(1)Asset-backed securities as shown above cost gains losses value\nFederally insured student loan securities $ 6,032 $ — $ (49) $ 5,983\nCollateralized loan obligation securities 321,127 9 (1,766) 319,370\n$ 327,159 $ 9 $ (1,815) $ 325,353\nInvestments in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock, Atlantic Central Bankers Bank (“ACBB”) stock, and Federal Reserve Bank stock are recorded at\ncost and amounted to $21.7 million at September 30, 2024, and $15.6 million at December 31, 2023. At each of those dates, ACBB stock amounted to $40,000.\nThe amount of FHLB stock required to be held is based on the amount of borrowings, and after repayment thereof, the stock may be redeemed.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of the Company’s investment securities at September 30, 2024, by contractual maturity, are shown below (dollars in\nthousands).

There were no gross realized gains on sales of securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand September 30, 2023. There were no realized losses on securities sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

At September 30, 2024, this security had a cost basis of $10.0 million, and comprises the balance of the corporate debt securities classification in the\ntables above. The Bank provided for a potential loss for the full amount of the $10.0 million par value of the trust preferred security through a provision for\ncredit loss of $10.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Interest payments on the trust preferred security have been deferred, as permitted by its terms for\nperiods up to five years. While the trust preferred security has previously been subject to interest deferral which was repaid, there can be no assurance that\nrepayment will occur for the current deferral. The Company has evaluated the securities in the above tables as of September 30, 2024 and has concluded that,\nexcept for the trust preferred security discussed above, none of these securities required an allowance for credit loss (“ACL”).\nThe Company evaluates whether an ACL is required by considering primarily the following factors: (a) the extent to which the fair value is less than the\namortized cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on\ncontractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) changes in the financial condition of the security’s underlying collateral and (e) the payment\nstructure of the security. The Company’s determination of the best estimate of expected future cash flows, which is used to determine the credit loss amount, is a\nquantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with internal assumptions and judgments regarding\nthe future performance of the security. With the exception of the trust preferred security discussed above and the CRE-2 security discussed in “Note 6. Loans,”\nthe Company concluded that the securities that are in an unrealized loss position are in a loss position because of changes in market interest rates after the\nsecurities were purchased. The severity of the impact of fair value in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments is consistent with market\ndevelopments. The Company’s analysis of each investment is performed at the security level. The Company intends to hold its investment securities to maturity,\nand it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery.\nNote 6. Loans\nThe Company has several lending lines of business including: SBLs, comprised primarily of SBA loans; direct lease financing primarily for commercial\nvehicles and to a lesser extent equipment; SBLOC collateralized by marketable securities; IBLOC collateralized by the cash value of eligible life insurance\npolicies; and investment advisor financing for purposes of debt refinance, acquisition of another firm or internal succession. In 2024, the Company began\nmaking consumer fintech loans which consist of short-term extensions of credit including secured credit card loans made in conjunction with marketers and\nservicers. Prior to 2020, the Company also originated non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans, primarily collateralized by multifamily properties\n(apartment buildings), and to a lesser extent, by hotel and retail properties, for sale into securitizations. At origination, the Company elected fair value treatment\nfor these loans as they were originally held-for-sale, to better reflect the economics of the transactions. In 2020, the Company decided to retain these loans on its\nbalance sheet as interest-earning assets and currently intends to continue doing so. Therefore, these loans are no longer accounted for as held-for-sale, but the\nCompany continues to present them at fair value. At September 30, 2024, such loans comprised $158.1 million of the $252.0 million of commercial loans, at\nfair value, with the balance comprised of the guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans also previously held for sale. The amortized cost of the $252.0 million\ncommercial loans at fair value was $255.7 million. Included in net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on commercial loans, at fair value in the consolidated\nstatements of operations are changes in the estimated fair value of such loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no related net\nunrealized losses or gains recognized for changes in fair value. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related net unrealized losses recognized for\nchanges in fair value were $1.7 million, $365,000 of which reflected losses attributable to credit weaknesses. In the third quarter of 2021, the Company resumed\nthe origination of non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans which it also intends to hold for investment\n14\nand which are accounted for at amortized cost. They are captioned as REBLs as they are transitional commercial mortgage loans which are made to improve\nand rehabilitate existing properties which already have cash flow.\nThe Bank has pledged the majority of its loans held for investment at amortized cost and commercial loans at fair value to either the FHLB or the Federal\nReserve Bank for lines of credit with those institutions. The FHLB and FRB lines are periodically utilized to manage liquidity. The amount of loans pledged\nvaries and the collateral may be unpledged at any time to the extent the collateral exceeds advances. The lines maintained are consistent with the Bank’s\nliquidity policy which maximizes potential liquidity. At September 30, 2024, $2.46 billion of loans were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank and $2.21 billion\nof loans were pledged to the FHLB against lines of credit which provide a source of liquidity to the Bank. There was $135.0 million drawn against the FHLB\nline at September 30, 2024.\nPrior to 2020, the Company sponsored the structuring of commercial mortgage loan securitizations, and in 2020, the Company decided not to pursue additional\nsecuritizations. The loans previously sold to the commercial mortgage-backed securitizations were transitional commercial mortgage loans made to improve\nand rehabilitate existing properties which already had cash flow. Servicing rights were not retained. Each of the securitizations is considered a variable interest\nentity of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Further, true sale accounting has been applicable to each of the securitizations, as supported by a\nreview performed by an independent third-party consultant. In each of the securitizations, the Company obtained a tranche of certificates which are accounted\nfor as available-for-sale debt securities. The securities were recorded at fair value at acquisition, which was determined by an independent third-party based on\nthe discounted cash flow method using unobservable (level 3) inputs.\nOf the six securities purchased by the Bank from our securitizations, all have been repaid except one issued by CRE-2, which is included in the commercial\nmortgage-backed securities classification in investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance of the Bank’s CRE-2-issued security was\n$12.6 million. As a result of the reduced excess of appraised value over the Bank’s principal and accruing interest based on new appraisals, the $12.6 million\nprincipal was placed in nonaccrual status and $1.3 million was reversed from securities interest in the second quarter of 2024. While the appraised values\nallocable to the Bank’s security exceed the principal and unpaid interest, there can be no assurance as to the amounts received upon the servicer’s disposition of\nthese properties, which will reflect additional servicing fees, actual disposition prices and other disposition costs.\nThe Company analyzes credit risk prior to making loans on an individual loan basis. The Company considers relevant aspects of the borrowers’ financial\nposition and cash flow, past borrower performance, management’s knowledge of market conditions, collateral and the ratio of loan amounts to estimated\ncollateral value in making its credit determinations. For SBLOC, the Company relies on the market value of the underlying securities collateral as adjusted by\nmargin requirements, generally 50% for equities and 80% for investment grade securities. For IBLOC, the Company relies on the cash value of insurance policy\ncollateral. Of the total $280.1 million of consumer fintech loans at September 30, 2024, $111.0 million consisted of secured credit card loans, with the balance\nconsisting of other short-term extensions of credit. Consumers do not pay interest on the majority of consumer fintech loan balances, including secured credit\ncard loans. The majority of the income on those loans is reflected in non-interest income under “Consumer credit fintech fees” and originate with the marketers\nand servicers for those loans. The secured credit card balances were collateralized with deposits at the Bank, with related income statement impact reflected\nboth in a lower cost of funds and fee income. The lower cost of funds results from balances required to be maintained to collateralize related card use. Related\nfee income is reflected in the “Consumer credit fintech fees” line of the income statement.\nMajor classifications of loans, excluding commercial loans at fair value, are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBL non-real estate $ 179,915 $ 137,752\nSBL commercial mortgage 665,608 606,986\nSBL construction 30,158 22,627\nSBLs 875,681 767,365\nDirect lease financing 711,836 685,657\nSBLOC / IBLOC(1) 1,543,215 1,627,285\nAdvisor financing(2) 248,422 221,612\nReal estate bridge loans 2,189,761 1,999,782\nConsumer fintech(3) 280,092 —\nOther loans(4) 46,586 50,638\n5,895,593 5,352,339\nUnamortized loan fees and costs 11,023 8,800\nTotal loans, including unamortized loan fees and costs $ 5,906,616 $ 5,361,139\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBLs, including costs net of deferred fees of $9,582 and $9,502\nfor September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively $ 885,263 $ 776,867\n15\nSBLs included in commercial loans, at fair value 93,888 119,287\nTotal SBLs(5) $ 979,151 $ 896,154\n(1) SBLOC are collateralized by marketable securities, while IBLOC are collateralized by the cash surrender value of insurance policies.

Maximum loan amounts are subject to loan-to-\nvalue ratios of 70% of the business enterprise value based on a third-party valuation but may be increased depending upon the debt service coverage ratio. Personal guarantees and blanket business\nliens are obtained as appropriate.\n(3) Consumer fintech loans included $111.0 million of secured credit card loans, with the balance consisting of other short-term extensions of credit.\n(4) Includes demand deposit overdrafts reclassified as loan balances totaling $960,000 and $1.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The surveillance committee further vets and approves the non-accrual status.\nThe following table summarizes non-accrual loans with and without an ACL as of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nSep tem be r 30, 2024 D ecember 31, 2023\nNon-accrual loans with a Non-accrual loans\nrelated ACL Related ACL without a related ACL Total non-accrual loans Total non-accrual loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 2,236 $ 524 $ 811 $ 3,047 $ 1,842\nSBL commercial mortgage 1,814 931 3,084 4,898 2,381\nSBL construction 1,585 118 — 1,585 3,385\nDirect leasing 3,211 1,867 708 3,919 3,785\nReal estate bridge loans — — 12,300 12,300 —\nOther loans — — — — 132\n$ 8,846 $ 3,440 $ 16,903 $ 25,749 $ 11,525\nThe Company had $61.7 million of other real estate owned (“OREO”) at September 30, 2024, and $16.9 million of OREO at December 31, 2023.

On April 2, 2024, the same loan was transferred from nonaccrual status\nto OREO, and comprised the majority of our OREO at September 30, 2024, with a balance at that date of $40.3 million. We intend to continue to manage the capital improvements on the underlying\napartment complex. As the units become available for lease, the property manager will be tasked with leasing these units at market rents. The $40.3 million balance compares to a September 2023\nthird party “as is” appraisal of $47.8 million, or an 84% “as is” loan to value (“LTV”), with additional potential collateral value as construction progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental\nrates. The Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for that apartment property acquired by the Bank through foreclosure. The purchaser has made earnest money deposits of $375,000,\nwith additional required deposits projected to total $500,000 prior to the December 31, 2024 closing deadline. The sales price is expected to cover the Company’s current OREO balance plus the\nforecasted cost of improvements to the property. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, earnest money deposits are expected to\naccrue to the Company. The nonaccrual balances in this table as of September 30, 2024, are also reflected in the substandard loan totals.\nInterest which would have been earned on loans classified as non-accrual for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $886,000 and\n$621,000, respectively. No income on non-accrual loans was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, $1.0 million of REBL, $69,000 of direct leasing, $130,000 of SBL commercial real estate, and $33,000 of SBL non-real estate were\nreversed from interest income, which represented interest accrued on loans placed into non-accrual status during the period. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, $89,000 of legacy commercial real estate,\n16\n$89,000 of SBL commercial real estate, $10,000 of SBL non-real estate, $13,000 of IBLOC, and $71,000 of direct leasing were reversed from interest income,\nwhich represented interest accrued on loans placed into non-accrual status during the period. Material amounts of prior year non-accrual interest reversals are\ncharged to the ACL, but such amounts were not material during either the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. In the third quarter of 2024\n$815,000 of interest was reversed from interest income as a result of REBL loan modifications.\nLoans which are experiencing financial stress are reviewed by the loan review department, which is independent of the lending lines. The review includes an\nanalysis for a potential specific reserve allocation in the ACL. For REBLs, updated appraisals are generally obtained in conjunction with modifications.\nDuring the three month and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, loans modified and related information are as follows\n(dollars in thousands):\nThree mo nt hs ended Septembe r 3 0, 2024 Three m on ths ended Septembe r 3 0, 2023\nPayment delay as Interest rate Payment delay as\na result of a reduction and Percent of total a result of a Percent of total\npayment deferral payment deferral Term extension Total loan category payment deferral Total loan category\nSBL non-real estate $ 819 $ — $ — $ 819 0.46% $ — $ — —\nSBL commercial mortgage — — — — — — — —\nDirect lease financing — — — — — — — —\nReal estate bridge loans — 55,336 — 55,336 2.53% — — —\nTotal $ 819 $ 55,336 $ — $ 56,155 0.95% $ — $ — —\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 Nine months ended September 30, 2023\nPayment delay as Interest rate Payment delay as\na result of a reduction and Percent of total a result of a Percent of total\npayment deferral payment deferral Term extension Total loan category payment deferral Total loan category\nSBL non-real estate $ 2,484 $ — $ — $ 2,484 1.38% $ 156 $ 156 0.12%\nSBL commercial mortgage 3,271 — — 3,271 0.49% — — —\nDirect lease financing — — 2,521 2,521 0.35% — — —\nReal estate bridge loans(1) — 87,836 — 87,836 4.01% — — —\nTotal $ 5,755 $ 87,836 $ 2,521 $ 96,112 1.63% $ 156 $ 156 —\n(1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the “as is” weighted average LTV of the real estate bridge lending balances was approximately 73%, and the “as stabilized” LTV was approximately\n66% based upon appraisals performed within the past twelve months. “As stabilized” LTVs reflect the third-party appraiser’s estimated value after the rehabilitation is complete and units are released\nat stabilized rates.

That balance comprises the balance of\nREBL nonaccrual loans as of September 30, 2024. The “as stabilized” LTV measures the apartment property’s value after renovations have been completed and\nunits have generally been re-leased.\nThere were no loans that received a term extension modification which had a payment default during the period and were modified in the twelve months before\ndefault.\n18\nThe Company had no commitments to extend additional credit to loans classified as modified for the periods ended September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nOf the $84.4 million special mention and $155.4 million substandard REBL loans at September 30, 2024, $55.3 million were modified in the third quarter of\n2024 and received reductions in interest rates and payment deferrals. Included in the $155.4 million was $26.9 million which had been modified in first quarter\n2024 with a six month payment deferral. The third quarter additional modification was for an additional three month payment deferral and a partial nine month\npayment deferral.\nNot included in the $55.3 million of REBL loans were (i) $19.3 million which was recapitalized with a new borrower, who negotiated a partial interest deferral\nand rate reduction, and (ii) $37.3 million which is accounted for at fair value, and as such, not reflected in modification totals. While payment deferrals have\ngenerally been for three to twelve months, that loan was granted a 15 month payment deferral, followed by a nine month partial payment deferral, in addition to\nan interest rate reduction. Going forward, the Company will not be accruing interest on this loan. The weighted average “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs for the\n$19.3 million balance were 72% and 68%, respectively, while those LTVs for the $37.3 million were 73% and 65%, respectively.\nThere were $56.2 million and $96.1 million of total loans classified as modified for the three month and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, with specific reserves of zero and $5,000, for the three month and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. There were zero\nand $156,000 of loans classified as modified for the three month and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2023. Substantially all of the reserves at\nSeptember 30, 2024 related to the non-guaranteed portion of SBA loans.\nManagement estimates the ACL quarterly and for most loan categories uses relevant available internal and external historical loan performance information to\ndetermine the quantitative component of the reserve and current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and other factors to determine\nthe qualitative component of the reserve. Reserves on specific credit-deteriorated loans comprise the third and final component of the reserve. Historical credit\nloss experience provides the quantitative basis for the estimation of expected credit losses over the estimated remaining life of the loans. The qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL is designed to be responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and the impact of current and future economic conditions on loan\nperformance, and is subjective. The review of the appropriateness of the ACL is performed by the Chief Credit Officer and presented to the Audit Committee of\nthe Company’s Board of Directors for review. With the exception of SBLOC and IBLOC, which utilize probability of default/loss given default, and the other\nloan category, which uses discounted cash flow to determine a reserve, the quantitative components for remaining categories are determined by establishing\nreserves on loan pools with similar risk characteristics based on a lifetime loss-rate model, or vintage analysis, as described in the following paragraph. Loans\nthat do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. If foreclosure is believed to be probable or repayment is expected from the sale of\ncollateral, a reserve for deficiency is established within the ACL. Those reserves are estimated based on the difference between loan principal and the estimated\nfair value of the collateral, adjusted for estimated disposition costs.\nBelow are the portfolio segments used to pool loans with similar risk characteristics and align with the Company’s methodology for measuring expected credit\nlosses. These pools have similar risk and collateral characteristics, and certain of these pools are broken down further in determining and applying the vintage\nloss estimates previously discussed. For instance, within the direct lease financing pool, government and public institution leases are considered separately.\nAdditionally, the Company evaluates its loans under an internal loan risk rating system as a means of identifying problem loans. The special mention\nclassification indicates weaknesses that may, if not cured, threaten the borrower’s future repayment ability. A substandard classification reflects an existing\nweakness indicating the possible inadequacy of net worth and other repayment sources. These classifications are used both by regulators and peers, as they have\nbeen correlated with an increased probability of credit losses. A summary of the Company’s primary portfolio pools and loans accordingly classified, by year of\norigination, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n19\nRe volving loans\nAs of September 30, 2024 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior at amortized cost Total\nSBL non real estate\nPass $ 28,815 $ 78,143 $ 29,382 $ 19,517 $ 5,969 $ 5,880 $ — $ 167,706\nSpecial mention — — — 667 215 149 — 1,031\nSubstandard 443 964 1,995 1,438 451 1,141 — 6,432\nTotal SBL non-real estate 29,258 79,107 31,377 21,622 6,635 7,170 — 175,169\nSBL commercial mortgage\nPass 100,153 96,812 133,887 78,897 64,899 151,737 — 626,385\nSpecial mention — — 534 1,108 — 2,413 — 4,055\nSubstandard — 13,285 1,380 12,233 254 3,606 — 30,758\nTotal SBL commercial mortgage 100,153 110,097 135,801 92,238 65,153 157,756 — 661,198\nSBL construction\nPass 8,829 12,363 2,394 3,625 927 — — 28,138\nSubstandard — — — 1,310 — 710 — 2,020\nTotal SBL construction 8,829 12,363 2,394 4,935 927 710 — 30,158\nDirect lease financing\nNon-rated 3,413 — — — — — — 3,413\nPass 226,080 218,088 151,653 53,905 20,283 7,295 — 677,304\nSpecial mention 2,079 2,403 2,837 1,922 136 113 — 9,490\nSubstandard 3,987 7,144 7,593 2,633 172 100 — 21,629\nTotal direct lease financing 235,559 227,635 162,083 58,460 20,591 7,508 — 711,836\nSBLOC\nNon-rated — — — — — — 3,991 3,991\nPass — — — — — — 985,272 985,272\nTotal SBLOC — — — — — — 989,263 989,263\nIBLOC\nNon-rated — — — — — — 52 52\nPass — — — — — — 553,351 553,351\nSpecial mention — — — — — — 46 46\nSubstandard — — — — — — 503 503\nTotal IBLOC — — — — — — 553,952 553,952\nAdvisor financing\nPass 54,214 86,674 55,480 23,241 18,511 — — 238,120\nSpecial mention — — 1,031 8,431 840 — — 10,302\nTotal advisor financing 54,214 86,674 56,511 31,672 19,351 — — 248,422\nReal estate bridge loans\nPass 353,084 421,321 807,514 368,011 — — — 1,949,930\nSpecial mention(1) 16,913 — 36,318 31,153 — — — 84,384\nSubstandard(1) 27,644 — 103,875 23,928 — — — 155,447\nTotal real estate bridge loans 397,641 421,321 947,707 423,092 — — — 2,189,761\nOther loans\nNon-rated 281,052 — — — — 10,320 — 291,372\nPass 727 163 257 353 2,607 38,612 1,445 44,164\nSpecial mention — — — — — 298 — 298\nTotal other loans(2) 281,779 163 257 353 2,607 49,230 1,445 335,834\n$ 1,107,433 $ 937,360 $ 1,336,130 $ 632,372 $ 115,264 $ 222,374 $ 1,544,660 $ 5,895,593\nUnamortized loan fees and costs — — — — — — — 11,023\nTotal $ 5,906,616\n(1) For the special mention and substandard real estate bridge loans, recent appraisals reflect a respective weighted average “as is” LTV of 77% and a further estimated 68% “as stabilized” LTV.

These loans are classified as SBL in the Company’s loan table, which classifies loans\nby type, as opposed to risk characteristics.\nSBL. Substantially all SBLs consist of SBA loans. The Bank participates in loan programs established by the SBA, including the 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program\n(the “7(a) Program”), the 504 Fixed Asset Financing Program (the “504 Program”), and the discontinued PPP. The 7(a) Program is designed to help small\nbusiness borrowers start or expand their businesses by providing partial guarantees of loans made by banks and non-bank lending institutions for specific\nbusiness purposes, including long or short-term working capital; funds for the purchase of equipment, machinery, supplies and materials; funds for the\npurchase, construction or renovation of real estate; and\n21\nfunds to acquire, operate or expand an existing business or refinance existing debt, all under conditions established by the SBA. The 504 Program includes the\nfinancing of real estate and commercial mortgages. In 2020 and 2021, the Company also participated in the PPP, which provided short-term loans to small\nbusinesses. PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. This program was a specific response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the vast majority of\nthese loans have been reimbursed by the U.S. government, with $1.6 million remaining to be reimbursed as of September 30, 2024. The Company segments the\nSBL portfolio into four pools: non-real estate, commercial mortgage and construction to capture the risk characteristics of each pool, and the PPP loans\ndiscussed above. PPP loans are not included in the risk pools because they have inherently different risk characteristics due to the U.S. government guarantee.\nIn the table above, the PPP loans are included in non-rated SBL non-real estate. The qualitative factors for SBL loans focus on pool loan performance,\nunderlying collateral for collateral dependent loans and changes in economic conditions. Additionally, the construction segment adds a qualitative factor for\ngeneral construction risk, such as construction delays resulting from labor shortages or availability/pricing of construction materials.\nDirect lease financing. The Company provides lease financing for commercial and government vehicle fleets and, to a lesser extent, provides lease financing for\nother equipment. Leases are either open-end or closed-end. An open-end lease is one in which, at the end of the lease term, the lessee must pay the difference\nbetween the amount at which the Company sells the leased asset and the stated termination value. Termination value is a contractual value agreed to by the\nparties at the inception of a lease as to the value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term. A closed-end lease is one for which no such payment is due on\nlease termination. In a closed-end lease, the risk that the amount received on a sale of the leased asset will be less than the residual value is assumed by the\nBank, as lessor. The qualitative factors for direct lease financing focus on underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, portfolio loan performance, loan\nconcentrations and changes in economic conditions.\nSBLOC. SBLOC loans are made to individuals, trusts and entities and are secured by a pledge of marketable securities maintained in one or more accounts for\nwhich the Company obtains a securities account control agreement. The securities pledged may be either debt or equity securities or a combination thereof, but\nall such securities must be listed for trading on a national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. SBLOCs are typically payable on\ndemand. Maximum SBLOC line amounts are calculated by applying a standard “advance rate” calculation against the eligible security type depending on asset\nclass: typically, up to 50% for equity securities and mutual fund securities and 80% for investment grade (Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB- or higher, or\nMoody’s rating of Baa3 or higher) municipal or corporate debt securities. Substantially all SBLOCs have full recourse to the borrower. The underlying\nsecurities collateral for SBLOC loans is monitored on a daily basis to confirm the composition of the client portfolio and its daily market value. The primary\nqualitative factor in the SBLOC analysis is the ratio of loans outstanding to market value. This factor has been maintained at low levels, which has remained\nappropriate as losses have not materialized despite the historic declines in the equity markets during 2020, during which there were no losses. Significant losses\nhave not been incurred since inception of this line of business. Additionally, the advance rates noted above were established to provide the Company with\nprotection from declines in market conditions from the origination date of the lines of credit.\nIBLOC. IBLOC loans are collateralized by the cash surrender value of eligible insurance policies. Should a loan default, the primary risks for IBLOCs are if\nthe insurance company issuing the policy were to become insolvent, or if that company would fail to recognize the Bank’s assignment of policy proceeds. To\nmitigate these risks, insurance company ratings are periodically evaluated for compliance with Bank standards. Additionally, the Bank utilizes assignments of\ncash surrender value, which legal counsel has concluded are enforceable. Significant losses have not been incurred since inception of this line of business. The\nqualitative factors for IBLOC primarily focus on the concentration risk with insurance companies.\nInvestment advisor financing. In 2020, the Bank began originating loans to investment advisors for purposes of debt refinancing, acquisition of another firm or\ninternal succession. Maximum loan amounts are subject to loan-to-value ratios of 70%, based on third-party business appraisals, but may be increased\ndepending upon the debt service coverage ratio. Personal guarantees and blanket business liens are obtained as appropriate. Loan repayment is highly dependent\non fee streams from advisor clientele. Accordingly, loss of fee-based investment advisory clients or negative market performance may reduce fees and pose a\nrisk to these credits. As credit losses have not been experienced, the ACL is determined by qualitative factors. The qualitative factors for investment advisor\nfinancing focus on historical industry losses, changes in lending policies and procedures, portfolio performance and economic conditions.\nReal estate bridge loans. Real estate bridge loans are transitional commercial mortgage loans which are made to improve and rehabilitate existing properties\nwhich already have cash flow, and which are securitized by those properties. Prior to 2020, such loans were originated for securitization and loans which had\nbeen originated but not securitized continue to be accounted for at fair value in “Commercial loans, at fair value”, on the balance sheet. In 2021, originations\nresumed and are being held for investment in “Loans, net of deferred fees and costs”, on the balance sheet. The Bancorp has minimal exposure to non-\nmultifamily commercial real estate such as office buildings, and instead has a portfolio largely comprised of rehabilitation bridge loans for apartment buildings.\nThese loans generally have three-year terms with two one-year extensions to allow for the rehabilitation work to be completed and rentals stabilized for an\nextended period, before being refinanced at lower rates through U.S. Government Sponsored Entities or other lenders. The rehabilitation real estate lending\nportfolio consists primarily of workforce housing, which the Company considers to be working class apartments at\n22\nmore affordable rental rates. As charge-offs have generally not been experienced for multifamily (apartment building loans) which comprise the REBL\nportfolio, the ACL is determined by qualitative factors. Qualitative factors focus on historical industry losses, changes in classified loan balances, changes in\neconomic conditions and underlying collateral and portfolio performance. In the third quarter of 2024, as a result of increased levels of loans classified as\nspecial mention or substandard, a new qualitative factor related to the level of such classified loans was added.\nConsumer fintech loans. Consumer fintech loans consist of short-term extensions of credit including secured credit card loans made in conjunction with\nmarketers and servicers. The majority of secured credit card balances are collateralized with deposits at the Bank, with related income statement impact\nreflected both in a lower cost of funds and fee income. The lower cost of funds results from balances required to be maintained to collateralize related card use.\nFee income for consumer fintech loans is reflected in the “Consumer credit fintech fees” line of the income statement.\nOther loans. Other loans include commercial and home equity lines of credit which the Company generally no longer offers. Qualitative factors focus on\nchanges in the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, portfolio loan performance, loan concentrations and changes in economic conditions.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the estimated remaining lives of loans. The estimate excludes possible extensions, renewals and modifications unless\neither of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation that a loan will be restructured, or the extension or renewal options are included in the\nborrower contract and are not unconditionally cancellable by us.\nThe Company does not measure an ACL on accrued interest receivable balances, because these balances are written off in a timely manner as a reduction to\ninterest income when loans are placed on non-accrual status.\nACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to\ncredit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The ACL on such off-balance\nsheet credit exposures, also referred to as loan commitments, is adjusted through the provision for credit losses. The estimate considers the likelihood that\nfunding will occur over the estimated life of the commitment. The amount of the ACL on such exposures as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31,\n2023 was $2.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively.\nA detail of the changes in the ACL by loan category and summary of loans evaluated individually and collectively for credit deterioration is as follows (in\nthousands):\n23\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor

In the first nine months of 2024,\nthe Company purchased $35.9 million of SBLs, none of which were credit deteriorated. Additionally, in the first nine months of 2024, the Company participated\nin SBLs with other institutions in the amount of $7.5 million.\nThe non-accrual loans in the following table are treated as collateral dependent to the extent they have resulted from borrower financial difficulty (and not from\nadministrative delays or other mitigating factors), and are not brought current. For non-accrual loans, the Company establishes a reserve in the allowance for\ncredit losses for deficiencies between estimated collateral and loan carrying values. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not\nhave any significant changes to the extent to which collateral secures its collateral dependent loans due to general collateral deterioration or from other factors.\nSBL non-real estate are collateralized by business assets, which may include certain real estate. SBL commercial mortgage and construction are collateralized\nby real estate for small businesses, while real estate bridge lending is primarily collateralized by apartment buildings, or other commercial real estate.

The\ntable above does not include an $11.2 million loan accounted for at fair value, and, as such, not reflected in delinquency tables. In third quarter 2024, the borrower notified the Company that he would\nno longer be making payments on the loan, which is collateralized by a vacant retail property. Based upon a July 2024 appraisal, the “as is” LTV is 84% and the “as stabilized” LTV is 62%. Since\n2021, real estate bridge lending originations have consisted of apartment buildings, while this loan was originated previously.\nThe scheduled maturities of the direct financing leases reconciled to the total lease receivables in the consolidated balance sheet, are as follows (dollars in\nthousands):\nRemaining 2024 $ 64,912\n2025 195,067\n2026 169,273\n2027 96,674\n2028 49,469\n2029 and thereafter 15,845\nTotal undiscounted cash flows 591,240\nResidual value(1) 224,392\nDifference between undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows (103,796)\nPresent value of lease payments recorded as lease receivables $ 711,836\n(1) Of the $224,392,000, $49,856,000 is not guaranteed by the lessee or other guarantors.\nNote 7. Transactions with Affiliates\nThe Bank did not maintain any deposits for various affiliated companies as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Bank has entered into lending transactions in the ordinary course of business with directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliates of such\npersons. All loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with\npersons not related to the lender. At September 30, 2024, these loans were current as to principal and interest payments and did not involve more than normal\nrisk of collectability. Loans to these related parties amounted to $5.2 million at September 30, 2024 and $5.7 million at December 31, 2023.\n28\nMr. Hersh Kozlov, a director of the Company, is a partner at Duane Morris LLP, an international law firm. The Company paid Duane Morris LLP $4,800 and\n$164,000 for legal services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNote 8. Fair Value Measurements\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of an entity’s assets and liabilities considered to be financial instruments. For\nthe Company, as for most financial institutions, the majority of its assets and liabilities are considered to be financial instruments. However, many such\ninstruments lack an available trading market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange transaction. Accordingly, estimated\nfair values are determined by the Company using the best available data and an estimation methodology it believes to be suitable for each category of financial\ninstruments. Also, it is the Company’s general practice and intent to hold its financial instruments to maturity whether or not categorized as available-for-sale\nand not to engage in trading or sales activities although it has sold loans and securities in the past and may do so in the future. For fair value disclosure\npurposes, the Company utilized certain value measurement criteria required in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC\n820”), as discussed below. In addition, ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to assets and liabilities. It clarifies that fair value is\nan exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants\nat the measurement date. It also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures concerning fair value measurements. ASC 820\nestablishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3\nmeasurements). Level 1 valuation is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities to which the Company has access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 valuation is based on other observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. This includes quoted prices for similar assets in active\nor inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks,\ndefault rates, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated through, observable market data by market-corroborated reports. Level 3 valuation is\nbased on “unobservable inputs” which the Company believes is the best information available in the circumstances. A financial instrument’s level within the fair\nvalue hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nChanges in the assumptions or methodologies used to estimate fair values may materially affect the estimated amounts. Also, there may not be reasonable\ncomparability between institutions due to the wide range of permitted assumptions and methodologies in the absence of active markets. This lack of uniformity\ngives rise to a high degree of subjectivity in estimating financial instrument fair values.\nCash and cash equivalents, which are comprised of cash and due from banks and the Company’s balance at the Federal Reserve Bank, had recorded values of\n$55.8 million and $1.04 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which approximated fair values.\nThe estimated Level 2 fair values of investment securities are based on quoted market prices, if available, or estimated independently by a third-party pricing\nservice based upon their matrix pricing technique. Level 3 investment security fair values are based on the present valuing of cash flows, which discounts\nexpected cash flows from principal and interest using yield to maturity, or yield to call as appropriate, at the measurement date. In the third quarter of 2024 and\n2023, there were no transfers between the three levels.\nFederal Reserve, FHLB, and ACBB stock, are held as required by those respective institutions and are carried at cost. Each of these institutions require their\nmembers to hold stock as a condition of membership. While a fixed stock amount is required by each of these institutions, the FHLB stock requirement\nperiodically increases or decreases with varying levels of borrowing activity.\nCommercial loans held at fair value are comprised primarily of commercial real estate bridge loans and SBA loans which had been originated for sale or\nsecuritization in the secondary market, and which are now being held on the balance sheet. Commercial real estate bridge loans and SBA loans are valued using\na discounted cash flow analysis based upon pricing for similar loans where market indications of the sales price of such loans are not available. SBA loans are\nvalued on a pooled basis and commercial real estate bridge loans are valued individually.\nLoans, net have an estimated fair value using the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate used in these calculations is the estimated current market\nrate adjusted for credit risk. Accrued interest receivable has a carrying value that approximates fair value.\nLoan fair values are based on “unobservable inputs” that are based on available information. Level 3 fair values are based on the present value of cash flows by\nunit of measurement.\nFor OREO, market value is based upon appraisals of the underlying collateral by third-party appraisers, reduced by 7% to 10% for estimated selling costs.\nThe estimated fair values of demand deposits (comprised of interest and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and certain types of money\nmarket accounts) are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (generally, their carrying\n29\namounts). The fair values of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term borrowings, when outstanding, are equal to their carrying amounts as\nthey are short-term borrowings.\nTime deposits, when outstanding, senior debt and subordinated debentures have a fair value estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies\ncurrent interest rates to discount expected cash flows. The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value. Long term borrowings\nresulting from sold loans which did not qualify for true sale accounting are presented in the amount of the principal of such loans.\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps, recorded in other assets or other liabilities, are determined using models that use readily observable market inputs and a\nmarket standard methodology applied to the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and interest rate indices.\nThe fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated based on the amount of unamortized deferred loan commitment fees. The fair value of letters of\ncredit is based on the amount of unearned fees plus the estimated cost to terminate the letters of credit. Fair values of unrecognized financial instruments,\nincluding commitments to extend credit, and the fair value of letters of credit are considered immaterial.\nThe following tables provide information

subject to judgments, assumptions and uncertainties, changes in which could\nhave a significant impact on such valuations. Weighted averages were calculated by using the discount rate for each individual security or loan weighted by its\nmarket value, except for SBA loans. For SBA loans, the yield derived from market pricing indications for comparable pools determined by date of loan\norigination. For commercial loans recorded at fair value, changes in fair value are reflected in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of securities\nwhich are unrelated to credit are recorded through equity. Changes in the fair value of loans recorded at amortized cost which are unrelated to credit are a\ndisclosure item, without impact on the financial statements. The notes below refer to the September 30, 2024 table.\n(1) Commercial mortgage-backed investment security, consisting of a single bank-issued CRE security, is valued using discounted cash flow analysis. The\ndiscount rate and prepayment rate applied are based upon market observations and actual experience for comparable securities and implicitly assume market\naverages for defaults and loss severities. The CRE-2 security has significant credit enhancement, or protection from other subordinated tranches in the issue,\nwhich limits the valuation exposure to credit losses. Nonetheless, increases in expected default rates or loss severities on the loans underlying the issue could\nreduce its value. In market environments in which investors demand greater yield compensation for credit risk, the discount rate applied would ordinarily be\nhigher and the valuation lower. Changes in loss experience could also change the interest earned on this holding in future periods and impact its fair value. As a\nsingle security, the weighted average rate shown is the actual rate applied to the CRE-2 security. For additional information related to this security, which was\ntransferred to nonaccrual status in the third quarter of 2024, see “Note 6. Loans.”\n32\n(2) Commercial – SBA Loans are comprised of the government guaranteed portion of SBA-insured loans. Their valuation is based upon the yield derived from\ndealer pricing indications for guaranteed pools, adjusted for seasoning and prepayments. A limited number of broker-dealers originate the pooled securities for\nwhich the loans are purchased and as a result, prices can fluctuate based on such limited market demand, although the government guarantee has resulted in\nconsistent historical demand. Valuations are impacted by prepayment assumptions resulting from both voluntary payoffs and defaults. Such assumptions for\nthese seasoned loans are based on a seasoning vector for constant prepayment rates from 3% to 30% over life.\n(3) Non-SBA commercial real estate – fixed are fixed rate non-SBA commercial real estate mortgages. These loans are fair valued by a third-party, based upon\ndiscounting at market rates for similar loans. Discount rates used in applying discounted cash flow analysis utilize input based upon loan terms, the general\nlevel of interest rates and the quality of the credit. Deterioration in loan performance or other credit weaknesses could result in fair value ranges which would be\ndependent upon potential buyers’ tolerance for such weaknesses and are difficult to estimate.\n(4) Non-SBA commercial real estate – floating are floating rate non-SBA loans, the majority of which are secured by multifamily properties (apartments). These\nare bridge loans designed to provide owners time and funding for property improvements and are generally valued using discounted cash flow analysis. The\ndiscount rate for the vast majority of these loans was based upon current origination rates for similar loans. Deterioration in loan performance or other credit\nweaknesses could result in fair value ranges which would be dependent upon potential buyers’ tolerance for such weaknesses and are difficult to estimate. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, these loans were fair valued by a third-party, based upon discounting at market rates for similar loans.\n(5) For OREO, fair value is based upon appraisals of the underlying collateral by third-party appraisers, reduced by 7% to 10% for estimated selling costs. Such\nappraisals reflect estimates of amounts realizable upon property sales based on the sale of comparable properties and other factors. Actual sales prices may vary\nbased upon the identification of potential purchasers, changing conditions in local real estate markets and the level of interest rates required to finance\npurchases.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, segregated by fair value hierarchy, during the periods shown are summarized below (dollars in\nthousands). The non-accrual loans in the following table are treated as collateral dependent to the extent they have resulted from borrower financial difficulty\n(and not from administrative delays or other mitigating factors), and are not brought current. For non-accrual loans, the Company establishes a reserve in the\nallowance for credit losses for deficiencies between estimated collateral and loan carrying values.\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted prices in active Significant other Significant\nmarkets for identical observable unobservable\nFair value assets inputs inputs(1)\nDescription September 30, 2024 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCollateral dependent loans with specific reserves(1) $ 5,410 $ — $ — $ 5,410\nOREO 61,739 — — 61,739\n$ 67,149 $ — $ — $ 67,149\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted prices in active Significant other Significant\nmarkets for identical observable unobservable\nFair value assets inputs inputs(1)\nDescription December 31, 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCollateral dependent loans with specific reserves(1) $ 8,944 $ — $ — $ 8,944\nOREO 16,949 — — 16,949\n$ 25,893 $ — $ — $ 25,893\n(1) The method of valuation approach for the loans evaluated for an allowance for credit losses on an individual loan basis and also for OREO was the market approach based upon appraisals of the\nunderlying collateral by external appraisers, reduced by 7% to 10% for estimated selling costs.\nAt September 30, 2024, principal on collateral dependent loans, which is accounted for on the basis of the value of underlying collateral, is shown at an\nestimated fair value of $5.4 million. To arrive at that fair value, related loan principal of $8.9 million was reduced by specific reserves of $3.5 million within the\nACL as of that date, representing the deficiency between principal and estimated collateral values, which were reduced by estimated costs to sell. When the\ndeficiency is deemed uncollectible, it is charged off by reducing the specific reserve and decreasing principal. Valuation techniques consistent with the market\nand/or cost approach were used to measure fair value and primarily included observable inputs for the individual loans being evaluated such as recent sales of\nsimilar collateral or observable market data for operational or carrying costs. In cases where such inputs were unobservable, the loan balance is reflected within\nthe Level 3 hierarchy.\n33\nNote 9. Other Identifiable Intangible Assets\nIn May 2016, the Company purchased approximately $60.0 million of lease receivables which resulted in a customer list intangible of $3.4 million that is being\namortized over a ten-year period. Amortization expense is $340,000 per year ($539,000 over the next three years). The gross carrying amount of the customer\nlist intangible is $3.4 million, and as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, the accumulated amortization expense was $2.9 million and\n$2.6 million.\nIn January 2020, the Company purchased McMahon Leasing and subsidiaries for approximately $8.7 million which resulted in $1.1 million of intangibles. The\ngross carrying value of $1.1 million of intangibles was comprised of a customer list intangible of $689,000, goodwill of $263,000 and a trade name valuation of\n$135,000.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\nASU 2023-07 enhances segment level disclosures, for both annual and quarterly reporting periods and is effective with the December 31, 2024 financial\nstatements. As a result of the enhancements, segment disclosures will include greater detail surrounding the nature of expenses now reported as a single line\nitem in the segment income statements. In addition to disclosing the chief operational decision maker by title and position, an explanation of how the segment\ninformation is used by that decision maker will be summarized.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09, effective January 1,\n2025, adds annual disclosures for the amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, shown separately for federal, state and foreign taxes. Total tax paid, net of\nrefunds, for any jurisdictions which exceed 5% of total net taxes paid, will also be shown separately. The Company is currently evaluating these disclosures.\nNote 11. Shareholders’ Equity\nOn October 20, 2021, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2022 fiscal year (the “2022 Repurchase\nProgram”). Under the 2022 Repurchase Program, the Company repurchased $15.0 million in value of the Company’s common stock in each quarter of 2022.\nOn October 26, 2022, the Board approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2023 fiscal year (the “2023 Repurchase Program”). Under the 2023\nRepurchase Program, the Company repurchased $25.0 million in value of the Company’s common stock in each quarter of 2023.\nOn October 26, 2023, the Board approved a common stock repurchase program for the 2024 fiscal year (the “2024 Repurchase Program”), which authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase $50.0 million in value of the Company’s common stock per fiscal quarter in 2024, for a maximum amount of $200.0 million. The\nCompany increased its share repurchase authorization for the second quarter of 2024 from $50.0 million to $100.0 million, which increased the maximum\namount under the 2024 Repurchase Program to $250.0 million. Under the 2024 Repurchase Program, the Company intends to repurchase shares through open\nmarket purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The 2024 Repurchase Program may be modified or terminated at any time. During\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1,037,069 shares and 5,317,686 shares of its common stock in the open market\nunder the 2024 Repurchase Program at an average price of $48.22 per share and $37.61 per share, respectively.\nAs a means of returning capital to shareholders, the Company implemented stock repurchase programs which totaled $40.0 million, $60.0 million and $100.0\nmillion, in equal quarterly amounts, respectively, in 2021, 2022 and 2023, with $200 million originally planned for 2024. Subsequently the second quarter 2024\nplanned repurchase was increased from $50 million to $100 million, with $50 million\n34\nin repurchases planned for each remaining quarter of 2024. The planned amounts of such repurchases are generally determined in the fourth quarter of the\npreceding year by assessing the impact of budgetary earnings projections on regulatory capital requirements. The excess of projected earnings over amounts\nrequired to maintain capital requirements is the maximum available for capital return to shareholders, barring any need to retain capital for other purposes. A\nsignificant portion of such excess earnings has been utilized for stock repurchases in the amounts noted above, while cash dividends have not been paid. In\ndetermining whether capital is returned through stock repurchases or cash dividends, the Company calculates a maximum share repurchase price, based upon\ncomparisons with what it concludes to be other exemplar peer share price valuations, with further consideration of internal growth projections. As these share\nprices, which are updated at least annually, have not been reached, capital return has consisted solely of stock repurchases. Exemplar share price comparisons\nare based upon multiples of earnings per share over time, with further consideration of returns on equity and assets. While repurchase amounts are planned in\nthe fourth quarter of the preceding year, repurchases may be modified or terminated at any time, should capital need to be conserved.\nNote 12. Regulatory Matters\nIt is the policy of the Federal Reserve that financial holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past\nyear and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that a\nfinancial holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the financial holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength\nto its banking subsidiaries.\nVarious federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory\napproval. Without the prior approval of the OCC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of\nthe current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Additionally, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s\nretained earnings. Moreover, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than “adequately capitalized”\nunder the prompt corrective action framework as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment\ndue to the FDIC. Similarly, a banking organization that fails to satisfy regulatory minimum capital conservation buffer requirements will be subject to certain\nlimitations, which include restrictions on capital distributions.\nIn addition to these explicit limitations, federal and state regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or financial holding company from\nengaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an\nunsafe or unsound banking practice.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum\ncapital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material\neffect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the\nCompany and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as\ncalculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification of the Company and the Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments\nby the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Moreover, capital requirements may be modified based upon regulatory rules or by\nregulatory discretion at any time reflecting a variety of factors including deterioration in asset quality.\nThe following table sets forth our regulatory capital amounts and ratios for the periods indicated:\nTier 1 capital Tier 1 capital Total capital Common equity\nto average to risk-weighted to risk-weighted tier 1 to risk\nassets ratio assets ratio assets ratio weighted assets\nAs of September 30, 2024\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 9.86% 13.62% 14.19% 13.62%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 10.94% 15.11% 15.67% 15.11%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\nAs of December 31, 2023\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 11.19% 15.66% 16.23% 15.66%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 12.37% 17.35% 17.92% 17.35%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\nNote 13. Legal\nOn June 12, 2019, the Bank was served with a qui tam lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, New Castle County. The Delaware\nDepartment of Justice intervened in the litigation. The case is titled The State of Delaware, Plaintiff, Ex rel. Russell S. Rogers, Plaintiff-Relator v. The Bancorp\nBank, Interactive Communications International, Inc., and InComm Financial Services, Inc., Defendants. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants violated the\nDelaware False Claims Act by not paying balances on certain open-\n35\nloop “Vanilla” prepaid cards to the State of Delaware as unclaimed property. The complaint seeks actual and treble damages, statutory penalties, and attorneys’\nfees. The Bank has filed an answer denying the allegations and continues to vigorously defend against the claims. The Bank and other defendants previously\nfiled a motion to dismiss the action, but the motion was denied and the case is in preliminary stages of discovery. The Company is unable to determine whether\nthe ultimate resolution of the matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or operations.\nOn September 14, 2021, Cachet Financial Services (“Cachet”) filed an adversary proceeding against the Bank in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central\nDistrict of California, titled Cachet Financial Services, Plaintiff v. The Bancorp Bank, et al., Defendants. The case was filed within the context of Cachet’s\npending Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. The Bank previously served as the Originating Depository Financial Institution (“ODFI”) for automated clearing house\n(“ACH”) transactions in connection with Cachet’s payroll services business. The matter arises from the Bank’s termination of its Payroll Processing ODFI\nAgreement with Cachet on October 23, 2019, for safety and soundness reasons. The initial complaint alleges eight causes of action: (i) breach of contract; (ii)\nnegligence; (iii) intentional interference with contract; (iv) conversion; (v) express indemnity; (vi) implied indemnity; (vii) accounting; and (viii) objection to\nthe Bank’s proof of claim in the bankruptcy case. On November 4, 2021, the Bank filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California\nto withdraw the reference of the adversary proceeding to the bankruptcy court, which was denied in February 2023. On August 3, 2022, Cachet served the Bank\nwith a First Amended Complaint wherein Cachet, among other things, withdraws its implied indemnity claim against the Bank and adds several defendants\nunaffiliated with the Bank and causes of action related to those parties. As to the Bank, Cachet seeks approximately $150 million in damages, an accounting and\ndisallowance of the Bank’s proof of claim. The Bank is vigorously defending against these claims. On September 28, 2022, the Bank filed a partial motion to\ndismiss, seeking to dispose of the majority of Cachet’s claims against the Bank. On September 12, 2024, the Bank’s partial motion to dismiss, seeking to\ndispose of the majority of Cachet’s claims was denied on procedural grounds and without reaching the issues the Bank raised in its partial motion to dismiss. On\nOctober 31, 2024, Cachet filed its Second Amended Complaint, which as related to the Bank, is substantially similar to the First Amended Complaint; however,\nthe Second Amended Complaint seeks only “damages in amount to be proven at trial” whereas the First Amended Complaint sought “damages in amount to be\nproven but in no event less than $150 million.” The Bank will defend against the Second Amended Complaint and respond to the Second Amended Complaint\nin compliance with applicable deadlines, as may be amended. The Company is not yet able to determine whether the ultimate resolution of this matter will have\na material adverse effect on the Company’s financial conditions or operations.\nOn March 27, 2023, the Bank received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) seeking documents\nand information related to the Bank’s escheatment practices in connection with certain accounts offered through one of the Bank’s program partners. The Bank\ncontinues to cooperate with the CFPB, including by responding to the CID. While the Company remains confident in the Bank’s escheatment practices, it\ncannot predict the timing or final outcome of the investigation. Future costs related to this matter may be material and could continue to be material at least\nthrough the completion of the investigation.\nOn November 21, 2023, TBBK Card Services, Inc. (“TBBK Card”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, was served with a complaint filed in the Superior\nCourt of the State of California, captioned People of the State of California, acting by and through San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu, Plaintiff v.\nInComm Financial Services, Inc., TBBK Card Services, Inc., Sutton Bank, Pathward, N.A., and Does 1-10, Defendants. The complaint principally alleges that\nthe defendants engaged in unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business acts and practices related to the packaging of “Vanilla” prepaid cards and the refund process\nfor unauthorized transactions that occurred due to card draining practices. On December 14, 2023, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California. On March 26, 2024, the case was remanded to the Superior Court of the State of California. TBBK Card is vigorously\ndefending against the claims. On May 6, 2024, TBBK Card filed a motion to quash service of summons as to TBBK Card for lack of personal jurisdiction,\nwhich is still pending. The Company is not yet able to determine whether the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s financial conditions or operations.\nIn addition, we are a party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Management believes that none of these\nactions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations.\nNote 14. Segment Financials\nThe Company’s operations can be classified under three segments: payments, specialty finance and corporate. The chief operating decision maker for these\nsegments is the Chief Executive Officer. The payments segment includes the deposit balances and non-interest income generated by prepaid, debit and other\ncard accessed accounts, ACH proccessing and other payments related processing. It also includes loan balances and interest and non-interest income from credit\nproducts generated through payment relationships. Specialty finance includes: (i) REBL (real estate bridge lending) comprised primarily of apartment building\nrehabilitation loans (ii) institutional banking comprised primarily of security-backed lines of credit, cash value insurance policy-backed lines of credit and\nadvisor financing and (iii) commercial loans comprised primarily of SBA loans and direct lease financing. It also includes deposits generated by those business\nlines. Corporate includes the Company’s investment securities, corporate overhead and expenses which have not been allocated to segments. Expenses not\nallocated include certain management, board oversight, administrative, legal, IT and technology infrastructure, human resouces, audit, regulatory and CRA,\nfinance and accounting, marketing and other corporate expenses.\n36\nIn the segment reporting below, a non-GAAP subtotal is shown, captioned “Income before non-interest expense allocation”. That subtotal presents an income\nsubotal before consideration of allocated corporate expenses which might be fixed, semi-fixed or otherwise resist changes without regard to a particular line of\nbusiness. It also reflects a market-based allocation of interest expense to financing segments which utilize funding from deposits generated by the payments\nsegment, which earns offsetting interest income. That allocation is shown in the “Interest allocation” line item. The rate utilized for the allocation corresponds\nto an estimated average of the three year FHLB rate. The payments segment interest expense line item consists of interest expense actually incurred to generate\nits deposits, which is the Company’s actual cost of funds. That actual cost is allocated to the corporate segment which requires funding for the Company’s\ninvestment securities portfolio.\nThe more significant non-interest expense categories correspond to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and include salaries and employee\nbenefits, data processing and software expenses that are incurred directly by those segments. Expenses incurred by departments which provide support services\nto the segments also include those categories of expense and others which are allocated to segments based on estimated usage. Those support department\nallocations are reflected in the “Risk, financial crimes and compliance” and “Information technology and operations” line items. Other expenses not shown\nseparately are monitored for purposes of expense management, but, unless atypically high, are ordinarily of lesser significance than the categories noted above.\nFor the payments segment, deposit growth and the cost thereof and non-interest income growth, are factors in the decision making process and are respectively\nreported in the consolidated statemens of operations. For specialty finance, loan growth and related yields are factors in decision making. Comparative loan\nbalance information measuring loan growth is presented in Note-E Loans. In addition to consideration of the above profitability and growth aspects of its\noperations, decision making is focused on the management of current and future potential risks. Such risks include, but are not limited to, credit, interest rate,\nliquidity, regulatory, and reputation. The loan committee provides support and oversight for credit risk, while the asset liability committee provides support and\noversight over pricing, duration and liquidity. The risk committee provides further oversight over those areas in addition to regulatory, reputation and other\nrisks.\nThe following tables provide segment information for the periods indicated

We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q except as required by applicable law.\nRecent Developments\nAs previously disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for an apartment\nproperty acquired by our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Bancorp Bank, National Association, through foreclosure in connection with a real estate bridge lending\n(“REBL”) loan. At September 30, 2024, the related $40.3 million balance, comprised the majority of our OREO. Subsequent to the previously reported\n$125,000 earnest money deposit in July 2024, the purchaser has made additional earnest money deposits of $250,000 bringing the total of such deposits to\n$375,000 in 2024. Additional required deposits are projected to total $500,000 prior to the December 31, 2024 closing deadline. The sales price is expected to\ncover the Company’s current OREO balance plus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will\nconsummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, earnest money deposits would accrue to the Company.\n40\nWhile real estate bridge loans classified as either special mention or substandard increased during the quarter, we believe that such classifications are at or near\ntheir peak. That conclusion is based, at least in part, on an independent review of a significant portion of the REBL portfolio performed during the third quarter\nby a firm specializing in such analysis. Additionally, the 50 basis point Federal Reserve rate reduction may provide immediate cash flow benefits to borrowers,\nwhile the further declining forward yield curve should support further liquidity benefits, as fixed rates decline. Moreover, respective weighted average “as is”\nand “as stabilized” LTVs of 77% and 68%, respectively, based upon appraisals in the past twelve months, continue to provide significant protection against loss.\nUnderlying property values as supported by such independent LTVs, continue to facilitate the recapitalization of certain loans from borrowers experiencing cash\nflow issues, to borrowers with greater financial capacity. At September 30, 2024, real estate bridge loans classified as special mention and substandard\nrespectively amounted to $84.4 million and $155.4 million compared to $96.0 million and $80.4 million at June 30, 2024. Each classified loan was evaluated\nfor a potential increase in the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on the basis of a third-party appraisals of apartment building collateral. On the basis of “as is”\nand “as stabilized” LTVs, increases to the allowance were not required. The current allowance for credit losses for REBL, is primarily based upon historical\nindustry losses for multi-family loans, in the absence of significant charge-offs within the Company’s REBL portfolio. As a result of increasing amounts of\nloans classified as special mention and substandard, the Company evaluated potential related sensitivity for REBL in the third quarter. Such evaluation is\ninherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to change as more information becomes available. As a result, the Company\nadded a new qualitative factor to its ACL with a cumulative after-tax impact of approximately $1.5 million ($2.0 million pre-tax), as described in “Note 6.\nLoans.”\nOverview\nThe Bancorp’s balance sheet has a risk profile enhanced by the special nature of the collateral supporting its loan niches, and related underwriting. Those loan\nniches have contributed to increased earnings levels, even during periods in which markets have experienced various economic stresses. Real estate bridge\nlending is comprised of workforce housing which we consider to be working class apartments at more affordable rental rates, in selected states. We believe that\nunderwriting requirements provide significant protection against loss, as supported by LTV ratios based on third-party appraisals. SBLOC and IBLOC loans are\ncollateralized by marketable securities and the cash value of life insurance, respectively, while SBA loans are either SBA 7(a) loans that come with significant\ngovernment-related guarantees, or SBA 504 loans that are made at 50-60% LTVs. Additional detail with respect to these loan portfolios is included in the\nrelated tables in “Financial Condition.” Also enhancing the Company’s risk profile is the substantial earnings impact of its payment businesses.\nNature of Operations\nWe are a Delaware financial holding company and our primary, wholly-owned subsidiary is The Bancorp Bank, National Association. The vast majority of our\nrevenue and income is currently generated through the Bank. In our continuing operations, we have four primary lines of specialty lending in our national\nspecialty finance segment:\n(cid:0)x SBLOC, IBLOC, and investment advisor financing;\n(cid:0)x leasing (direct lease financing);\n(cid:0)x SBLs, consisting primarily of SBA loans;\n(cid:0)x non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans; and\n(cid:0)x beginning in 2024, consumer fintech lending.\nSBLOCs and IBLOCs are loans that are generated through affinity groups and are respectively collateralized by marketable securities and the cash value of\ninsurance policies. SBLOCs are typically offered in conjunction with brokerage accounts and are offered nationally. IBLOC loans are typically viewed as an\nalternative to standard policy loans from insurance companies and are utilized by our existing advisor base as well as insurance agents throughout the country.\nInvestment advisor financing are loans made to investment advisors for purposes of debt refinance, acquisition of another investment firm or internal\nsuccession. Vehicle fleet and, to a lesser extent, other equipment leases are generated in a number of Atlantic Coast and other states and are collateralized\nprimarily by vehicles. SBA loans are generated nationally and are collateralized by commercial properties and other types of collateral. Our non-SBA\ncommercial real estate bridge loans, at fair value, are primarily collateralized by multifamily properties (apartment buildings), and to a lesser extent, by hotel\nand retail properties. These loans were originally generated for sale through securitizations. In 2020, we decided to retain these loans on our balance sheet as\ninterest-earning assets and resumed originating such loans in the third quarter of 2021. These new originations are identified as real estate bridge loans, consist\nof apartment building loans, and are held for investment in the loan portfolio. Prior originations originally intended for securitizations continue to be accounted\nfor at fair value, and are included on the balance sheet in “Commercial loans, at fair value.”\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we initiated our measured entry into consumer fintech lending, by which we make consumer loans with the marketing and\nservicing assistance of existing and planned new fintech relationships. While the $280.1 million of such loans at September 30, 2024 did not significantly\nimpact income during the quarter, such lending is expected to meaningfully impact both the balance sheet and income in the future. We expect that impact will\nbe reflected in a lower cost of funds for related deposits and increased transaction fees.\n41\nThe majority of our deposits and non-interest income are generated in our payments segment, or Fintech Solutions Group, which consists of consumer\ntransaction accounts accessed by Bank-issued prepaid or debit cards and payment companies that process their clients’ corporate and consumer payments,\nautomated clearing house (“ACH”) accounts, the collection of card payments on behalf of merchants and other payments through our Bank. The card-accessed\ndeposit accounts are comprised of debit and prepaid card accounts that are generated by companies that market directly to end users. Our card-accessed deposit\naccount types are diverse and include: consumer and business debit, general purpose reloadable prepaid, pre-tax medical spending benefit, payroll, gift,\ngovernment, corporate incentive, reward, business payment accounts and others. Our ACH accounts facilitate bill payments and our acquiring accounts provide\nclearing and settlement services for payments made to merchants which must be settled through associations such as Visa or Mastercard. Consumer transaction\naccount banking services are provided to organizations with a pre-existing customer base tailored to support or complement the services provided by these\norganizations to their customers, which we refer to as “affinity or private label banking.” These services include loan and deposit accounts for investment\nadvisory companies through our Institutional Banking department. We typically provide these services under the name and through the facilities of each\norganization with whom we develop a relationship.\nPerformance Summary\nOur net income increased to $51.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, from $50.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. Our cost of funds rose slightly to\n2.54% in the third quarter of 2024 from 2.50% in the third quarter of 2023. See “Asset and Liability Management” in this MD&A for further discussion of how\nour funding sources and loans adjust to Federal Reserve rate changes.\nPrepaid, debit card and other payment fees, including ACH, are the largest drivers of non-interest income. Such fees for the third quarter of 2024 increased $3.7\nmillion over the comparable 2023 period.\nThere was a $3.5 million provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of $1.8 million in the third quarter of\n2023.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe use a number of key performance indicators (“KPIs”) to measure our overall financial performance and believe they are useful to investors because they\nprovide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. We describe how we calculate and use a number of these KPIs and\nanalyze their results below.\n(cid:0)x Return on assets and return on equity. Two KPIs commonly used within the banking industry to measure overall financial performance are return on\nassets and return on equity. Return on assets measures the amount of earnings compared to the level of assets utilized to generate those earnings and is\nderived by dividing net income by average assets. Return on equity measures the amount of earnings compared to the equity utilized to generate those\nearnings and is derived by dividing net income by average shareholders’ equity.\n(cid:0)x Ratio of equity to assets. Ratio of equity to assets is another KPI frequently utilized within the banking industry and is derived by dividing period-end\nshareholders’ equity by period-end total assets.\n(cid:0)x Net interest margin and credit losses. Net interest margin is a KPI associated with net interest income, which is the largest component of our earnings\nand is the difference between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets consisting of loans and investments, less the interest on our funding,\nconsisting primarily of deposits. Net interest margin is derived by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Higher levels of\nearnings and net interest income on lower levels of assets, equity and interest-earning assets are generally desirable. However, these indicators must be\nconsidered in light of regulatory capital requirements, which impact equity, and credit risk inherent in loans. Accordingly, the magnitude of credit\nlosses is an additional KPI.\n(cid:0)x Other KPIs. Other KPIs we use from time to time include growth in average loans and leases, non-interest income growth, the level of non-interest\nexpense and various capital measures including equity to assets.\nResults of KPIs\nIn the third quarter of 2024, return on assets and return on equity amounted to 2.55% and 25.74% (annualized), respectively, compared to 2.71% and 26.12%\n(annualized) in the third quarter of 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, return on assets, and return on equity amounted to 2.76% and\n26.61% (annualized), respectively, compared to 2.66% and 27.01% (annualized) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.\n42\nAt September 30, 2024, the ratio of equity to assets was 10.07%, compared to 10.36% at September 30, 2023, reflecting an increase in equity capital from\nretained earnings and an increase in unrealized income on securities partially offset by share repurchases. The ratio fell slightly as a result of the increase in\nperiod end assets.\nNet interest margin was 4.78% in the third quarter of 2024, versus 5.07% in the third quarter of 2023. Net interest margin for third quarter 2024 was reduced by\nthe reversal of $1.6 million ($1.2 million, net of tax) of prior period interest related to both real estate bridge loans transferred to non-accrual status during the\nquarter and loan modifications with retroactive rate reductions.\nAverage loans and leases increased to $6.02 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $5.61 billion in the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit\nlosses was $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements\nin conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the\naccompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We view critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with GAAP\nthat involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations. Our critical accounting policies and estimates as of September 30, 2024, remain unchanged from those presented in the 2023 Form 10-K under Part\nII, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nResults of Operations\nComparison of third quarter 2024 to third quarter 2023\nNet Income\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $51.5 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, compared to $50.1 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the third\nquarter of 2023. Income before income taxes was $69.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $66.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Income\nincreased between those respective periods primarily as a result of higher net interest income, which resulted primarily from higher loan and investment\nsecurities balances and higher fintech related payment and credit fees.\nNet Interest Income\nOur net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased $4.9 million, or 5.5%, to $93.7 million from $88.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Our\ninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $139.7 million, an increase of $10.7 million, or 8.3%, from $129.0 million for the third quarter of\n2023. The increase in interest income resulted primarily from higher investment securities and loan balances as our average loans and leases increased to\n$6.02 billion for the third quarter of 2024 from $5.61 billion for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $415.0 million, or 7.4%. Related interest income\nincreased $5.9 million on a tax equivalent basis. SBLOC and IBLOC balances at September 30, 2024 were approximately 1% lower than those at June 30,\n2024, after having shown larger decreases in prior periods. At September 30, 2024, the respective balances of SBLOC and IBLOC loans were $989.3 million\nand $554.0 million, respectively, compared to $1.01 billion and $712.6 million at September 30, 2023. Loans in other categories with higher yields more than\noffset the impact of the SBLOC and IBLOC decreases, which also contributed to the higher net interest income. Of the total $5.9 million increase in loan\ninterest income on a tax equivalent basis, the largest increases were $2.2 million for all real estate bridge loans, $3.3 million for small business lending, $2.8\nmillion for leasing and $1.3 million for investment advisor financing, while total SBLOC and IBLOC decreased $4.1 million.\nOur average investment securities of $1.58 billion for the third quarter of 2024 increased $806.6 million from $771.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nRelated tax equivalent interest income increased $10.1 million, primarily reflecting an increase in balances.\nOur net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets) for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.78% compared to\n5.07% for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 29 basis points. While the yield on interest-earning assets decreased 23 basis points, the cost of deposits and\ninterest-bearing liabilities increased 4 basis points, or a net change of 27 basis points. Average interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank decreased\n$392.6 million, or 61.3%, to $247.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $639.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting the impact of the purchase of\napproximately $900 million of securities in April 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the average yield on our loans decreased to 7.73% from 7.89% for the third\nquarter of 2023, a decrease of 16 basis points. Yields on taxable investment securities in the third quarter of 2024 was 5.02% compared to 5.02% for the third\nquarter of 2023.\n43\nAverage Daily Balances\nThe following table presents the average daily balances of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity and the respective interest earned or paid on interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as average annualized rates, for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended September 30, Three months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 vs 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\nDue to\nBalance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Volume Due to Rate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAssets:\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans, net of deferred loan fees and costs(1) $ 6,017,911 $ 116,367 7.73% $ 5,603,514 $ 110,506 7.89% $ 7,956 $ (2,095) $ 5,861\nLeases-bank qualified(2) 5,151 146 11.34% 4,585 110 9.60% 15 21 36\nInvestment securities-taxable 1,575,091 19,767 5.02% 768,364 9,647 5.02% 10,124 (4) 10,120\nInvestment securities-nontaxable(2) 2,927 55 7.52% 3,005 50 6.66% (1) 6 5\nInterest-earning deposits at Federal Reserve Bank 247,344 3,387 5.48% 639,946 8,689 5.43% (5,377) 75 (5,302)\nNet interest-earning assets 7,848,424 139,722 7.12% 7,019,414 129,002 7.35%\nAllowance for credit losses (28,254) (23,147)\nOther assets 222,646 338,085\n$ 8,042,816 $ 7,334,352 12,717 (1,997) 10,720\nLiabilities and shareholders' equity:\nDeposits:\nDemand and interest checking $ 6,942,029 $ 42,149 2.43% $ 6,229,668 $ 37,913 2.43% 4,325 (89) 4,236\nSavings and money market 65,079 549 3.37% 56,538 518 3.66% 65 (34) 31\nTotal deposits 7,007,108 42,698 2.44% 6,286,206 38,431 2.45%\nShort-term borrowings 73,480 1,030 5.61% — — — 1,030 — 1,030\nRepurchase agreements — — — 41 — — — — —\nLong-term borrowings 38,235 689 7.21% 9,889 128 5.18% 493 68 561\nSubordinated debt 13,401 297 8.87% 13,401 293 8.75% — 4 4\nSenior debt 96,071 1,234 5.14% 95,714 1,234 5.16% — — —\nTotal deposits and liabilities 7,228,295 45,948 2.54% 6,405,251 40,086 2.50%\nOther liabilities 18,362 167,673\nTotal liabilities 7,246,657 6,572,924 5,913 (51) 5,862\nShareholders' equity 796,159 761,428\n$ 8,042,816 $ 7,334,352\nNet interest income on tax equivalent basis(2) $ 93,774 $ 88,916 $ 6,804 $ (1,946) $ 4,858\nTax equivalent adjustment 42 34\nNet interest income $ 93,732 $ 88,882\nNet interest margin(2) 4.78% 5.07%\n(1) Includes commercial loans, at fair value.

The increase reflected decreased average interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of $392.6 million, the impact of which was\nmore than offset by increased average balances of loans and leases of $415.0 million, or 7.4%, and increased average investment securities of $806.6 million, or\n104.6%. The increase reflected the purchase of approximately $900 million of fixed rate securities to reduce exposure to possible future Federal Reserve rate\ndecreases. For those respective periods, average demand and interest checking deposits increased $712.4 million, or 11.4%. The interest expense shown for\ndemand and interest checking is primarily comprised of interest paid to our affinity groups.\n44\nProvision for Credit Losses\nOur provision for credit losses was $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a provision of $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The ACL was\n$31.0 million, or 0.52% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $27.4 million, or 0.51% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. As a result of a new\nqualitative factor for classified REBL loans, the provision for credit losses was increased by $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. The provision also\nreflected the impact of continuing higher leasing net charge-offs, especially in long haul and local trucking, transportation and related activities for which total\nexposure was approximately $34 million at September 30, 2024. We believe that our ACL is appropriate and supportable. For more information about our\nprovision and ACL and our loss experience, see “Item 2 – Allowance for Credit Losses,” “Item 2 – Net Charge-offs,” and “Item 2 – Non-accrual Loans, Loans\n90 days Delinquent and Still Accruing, OREO and Modified Loans,” below and “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income was $32.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $26.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The $5.3 million, or 19.9%, increase\nbetween those respective periods reflected an increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees. The increase also reflected increased ACH, card and other\npayment processing fees. Prepaid, debit card and related fees increased $2.4 million, or 11.1%, to $23.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to\n$21.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase reflected higher transaction volume from new clients and organic growth from existing clients. ACH,\ncard and other payment processing fees increased $1.3 million, or 52.4%, to $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.6 million in the third\nquarter of 2023, reflecting an increase in rapid funds transfer volume.\nConsumer credit fintech fees amounted to $1.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, as we began our entry into consumer fintech lending in the second quarter\nof 2024. Such lending may also be reflected in a lower cost of deposits, as a result of associated deposits.\nNet realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, at fair value, increased $81,000, or 15.4%, to $606,000 for the third quarter of 2024 from $525,000 for\nthe third quarter of 2023.\nLeasing related income decreased $695,000, or 39.3%, to $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 from $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nOther non-interest income increased $609,000, or 144.3%, to $1.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 from $422,000 in the third quarter of 2023 which\nreflected increased payoff fees on advisor financing loans.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense was $53.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $5.8 million, or 12.2%, compared to $47.5 million for the third quarter\nof 2023. An 11.0%, increase in salaries and employee benefits expense reflected increases in payments related financial crimes and IT salary expense and an\nincrease in incentive compensation expenses.\nThe following table presents the principal categories of non-interest expense for the periods indicated:\nFor the three months en ded September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 33,821 $ 30,475 $ 3,346 11.0%\nDepreciation 1,047 644 403 62.6%\nRent and related occupancy cost 1,734 1,510 224 14.8%\nData processing expense 1,408 1,404 4 0.3%\nAudit expense 403 446 (43) (9.6%)\nLegal expense 1,055 1,203 (148) (12.3%)\nFDIC insurance 904 806 98 12.2%\nSoftware 4,561 4,427 134 3.0%\nInsurance 1,246 1,321 (75) (5.7%)\nTelecom and IT network communications 283 305 (22) (7.2%)\nConsulting 418 448 (30) (6.7%)\nWrite-downs and other losses on other real estate owned — 131 (131) (100.0%)\nOther 6,375 4,339 2,036 46.9%\nTotal non-interest expense $ 53,255 $ 47,459 $ 5,796 12.2%\n45\nChanges in non-interest expense were as follows:\n(cid:0)x Salaries and employee benefits expense increased to $33.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $3.3 million, or 11.0%, from\n$30.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Depreciation expense increased $403,000, or 62.6%, to $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $644,000 in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting\nthe impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n(cid:0)x Rent and related occupancy cost increased $224,000, or 14.8%, to $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $1.5 million in the third quarter of\n2023, reflecting the impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n(cid:0)x Data processing expense increased $4,000, or 0.3%, to $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2023,\nreflecting higher transaction volume.\n(cid:0)x Audit expense decreased $43,000, or 9.6%, to $403,000 in the third quarter of 2024 from $446,000 in the third quarter of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Legal expense decreased $148,000, or 12.3%, to $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n(cid:0)x FDIC insurance expense increased $98,000, or 12.2%, to $904,000 for the third quarter of 2024 from $806,000 in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting\nincreases in liabilities against which insurance rates are applied.\n(cid:0)x Software expense increased $134,000, or 3.0%, to $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.

The $652,000 increase in OREO expense,\nreflected expenses on the $39.4 million apartment property transferred to OREO in the second quarter of 2024, as described in “Note 6. Loans.” The\nOREO balance of that property as of September 30, 2024 was $40.3 million.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $17.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $16.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase resulted primarily from\nan increase in income, substantially all of which is subject to income tax. A 25.4% effective tax rate in 2024 and a 24.6% effective tax rate in 2023 primarily\nreflected a 21% federal tax rate and the impact of various state income taxes.\nComparison of first nine months 2024 to first nine months 2023\nNet Income\nNet income for the first nine months of 2024 was $161.6 million, or $3.15 per diluted share, compared to $148.3 million, or $2.68 per diluted share, for the first\nnine months of 2023. Income before income taxes was $215.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $197.6 million in the first nine months of\n2023. Income increased between those respective periods primarily as a result of higher net interest income, which reflected the cumulative impact of Federal\nReserve rate increases in 2023 on the loan and securities portfolios, prior to Federal Reserve rate decreases in September 2024. Additionally, growth in higher\nyielding loan categories offset reductions in lower yielding SBLOC and IBLOC balances.\nNet Interest Income\nOur net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 increased $20.1 million, or 7.7%, to $281.9 million from $261.9 million in the first nine months of\n2023. Our interest income for the first nine months of 2024 increased to $412.8 million, an increase of $35.4 million, or 9.4%, from $377.4 million for the first\nnine months of 2023. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in loan yields resulting from the aforementioned Federal Reserve rate increases, as\nour average loans and leases increased to $5.83 billion for the first nine months of 2024 from $5.78 billion for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of\n$57.6 million, or 1.0%. Related interest income increased $21.6 million on a tax equivalent basis. At September 30, 2024, the respective balances of SBLOC\nand IBLOC loans were $989.3 million and $554.0 million, respectively, compared to $1.01 billion and $712.6 million at September 30, 2023. Loans in other\ncategories with higher yields partially offset the year over year SBLOC and IBLOC decreases, which also contributed to the higher net\n46\ninterest income. Of the total $21.6 million increase in loan interest income on a tax equivalent basis, the largest increases were $14.6 million for all real estate\nbridge loans, $9.6 million for small business lending, $8.0 million for leasing and $4.0 million for investment advisor financing, while total SBLOC and IBLOC\ndecreased $16.2 million.\nOur average investment securities of $1.26 billion for the first nine months of 2024 increased $481.8 million from $776.7 million for the first nine months of\n2023. Related tax equivalent interest income increased $18.1 million, primarily reflecting an increase in balances.\nHigher yields on loans reflected the continuing impact of Federal Reserve rate increases as variable rate loans repriced to higher rates, prior to the Federal\nReserve’s September 2024 rate reduction. Federal Reserve rate changes had an immediate impact on cost of funds, while their impact on variable rate loans\nlags. Generally, interest expense is contractually adjusted daily. The majority of our loans and securities are variable rate and generally reprice monthly or\nquarterly, although some reprice over several years.\nOur net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets) for the first nine months of 2024 was 4.96% compared to\n4.86% for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 10 basis points. While the yield on interest-earning assets increased 26 basis points, the cost of deposits\nand interest-bearing liabilities increased 17 basis points, or a net change of 9 basis points. Investment securities yields reflected the $1.3 million second quarter\n2024 impact of placing a security in nonaccrual status as described in “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein. Average\ninterest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank decreased $153.7 million, or 24.0%, to $486.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 from\n$640.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, the average yield on our loans increased to 7.90% from 7.48% for the first nine\nmonths of 2023, an increase of 42 basis points. Yields on taxable investment securities in the first nine months of 2024 increased to 4.98% compared to 4.97%\nfor the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 1 basis point.\n47\nAverage Daily Balances\nThe following table presents the average daily balances of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity and the respective interest earned or paid on interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as average annualized rates, for the periods indicated:\nN in e m onths end ed Se ptember 30, Nine mo nt hs ended Sept em be r 30,\n2024 2023 2024 vs 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\nDue to\nBalance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Volume Due to Rate Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAssets:\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans, net of deferred loan fees and costs(1) $ 5,828,938 $ 345,497 7.90% $ 5,772,266 $ 324,009 7.48% $ 3,208 $ 18,280 $ 21,488\nLeases-bank qualified(2) 4,840 379 10.44% 3,920 279 9.49% 70 30 100\nInvestment securities-taxable 1,255,532 46,921 4.98% 773,485 28,820 4.97% 18,015 86 18,101\nInvestment securities-nontaxable(2) 2,905 155 7.11% 3,193 144 6.01% (11) 22 11\nInterest-earning deposits at Federal Reserve Bank 486,883 19,948 5.46% 640,554 24,271 5.05% (6,539) 2,216 (4,323)\nNet interest-earning assets 7,579,098 412,900 7.26% 7,193,418 377,523 7.00%\nAllowance for credit losses (27,993) (23,192)\nOther assets 280,733 269,072\n$ 7,831,838 $ 7,439,298 14,743 20,634 35,377\nLiabilities and shareholders' equity:\nDeposits:\nDemand and interest checking $ 6,684,671 $ 120,405 2.40% $ 6,343,711 $ 106,984 2.25% 5,923 7,498 13,421\nSavings and money market 58,777 1,453 3.30% 88,738 2,465 3.70% (763) (249) (1,012)\nTime — — — 27,802 858 4.11% (858) — (858)\nTotal deposits 6,743,448 121,858 2.41% 6,460,251 110,307 2.28%\nShort-term borrowings 55,820 2,344 5.60% 6,758 234 4.62% 2,050 60 2,110\nRepurchase agreements 4 — — 41 — — — — —\nLong-term borrowings 38,371 2,060 7.16% 9,945 382 5.12% 1,473 205 1,678\nSubordinated debt 13,401 880 8.76% 13,401 825 8.21% — 55 55\nSenior debt 95,983 3,701 5.14% 97,220 3,793 5.20% (48) (44) (92)\nTotal deposits and liabilities 6,947,027 130,843 2.51% 6,587,616 115,541 2.34%\nOther liabilities 73,507 117,822\nTotal liabilities 7,020,534 6,705,438 7,777 7,525 15,302\nShareholders' equity 811,304 733,860\n$ 7,831,838 $ 7,439,298\nNet interest income on tax equivalent basis(2) $ 282,057 $ 261,982 $ 6,966 $ 13,109 $ 20,075\nTax equivalent adjustment 112 89\nNet interest income $ 281,945 $ 261,893\nNet interest margin(2) 4.96% 4.86%\n(1) Includes commercial loans, at fair value.

The increase reflected decreased average interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of $153.7 million, the impact of\nwhich was more than offset by increased average balances of loans and leases of $57.6 million, or 1.0%, and increased average investment securities of\n$481.8 million, or 62.0%. For those respective periods, average demand and\n48\ninterest checking deposits increased $341.0 million, or 5.4%. The interest expense shown for demand and interest checking is primarily comprised of interest\npaid to our affinity groups.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nOur provision for credit losses was $7.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to a provision of $4.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. The\nACL was $31.0 million, or 0.52% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $27.4 million, or 0.51% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. As a result\nof a new qualitative factor for classified REBL loans, the provision for credit losses was increased by $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. The provision\nalso reflected the impact of continuing higher leasing net charge-offs, especially in long haul and local trucking, transportation and related activities for which\ntotal exposure was approximately $34 million at September 30, 2024. We believe that our ACL is appropriate and supportable. For more information about our\nprovision and ACL and our loss experience, see “Item 2 – Allowance for Credit Losses,” “Item 2 – Net Charge-offs,” and “Item 2 – Non-accrual Loans, Loans\n90 days Delinquent and Still Accruing, OREO and Modified Loans,” below and “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income was $92.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $85.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. The $7.1 million, or 8.4%,\nincrease between those respective periods reflected an increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees. The increase also reflected increased ACH, card and other\npayment processing fees. Prepaid, debit card and related fees increased $5.9 million, or 8.9%, to $72.9 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to\n$67.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. The first quarter of 2023 included approximately $600,000 of non-interest income related to the fourth quarter of\n2022, and a $1.4 million termination fee from a client which formed its own bank. The increase reflected higher transaction volume from new clients and\norganic growth from existing clients. ACH, card and other payment processing fees increased $2.7 million, or 37.8%, to $9.9 million for the first nine months of\n2024, compared to $7.2 million in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting an increase in rapid funds transfer volume.\nConsumer credit fintech fees amounted to $1.7 million for 2024, as we began our entry into consumer fintech lending. Such lending may also be reflected in a\nlower cost of deposits, as a result of associated deposits.\nNet realized and unrealized gains on commercial loans, at fair value, decreased $2.0 million, or 47.1%, to $2.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 from\n$4.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease reflected the runoff of the commercial loans, at fair value portfolio, which has continued to reduce\nthe volume of loan payoffs and the income recognized at the time of payoff.\nLeasing related income decreased $1.9 million, or 39.4%, to $2.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 from $4.8 million for the first nine months of 2023,\nreflecting $1.1 million of losses related to an auto auction company which ceased operations.\nOther non-interest income increased $574,000, or 28.7%, to $2.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 from $2.0 million in the first nine months of 2023\nreflecting increased payoff fees on advisor financing loans.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense was $151.4 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of $6.0 million, or 4.1%, compared to $145.4 million for the first\nnine months of 2023. While salaries and employee benefits increased 4.9%, increases in the payments business and related financial crimes and in IT salary\nexpense, were offset by decreases in incentive compensation.\n49\nThe following table presents the principal categories of non-interest expense for the periods indicated:\nFor the nine months end ed September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 97,964 $ 93,427 $ 4,537 4.9%\nDepreciation 3,023 2,046 977 47.8%\nRent and related occupancy cost 5,060 4,265 795 18.6%\nData processing expense 4,252 4,123 129 3.1%\nAudit expense 1,081 1,255 (174) (13.9%)\nLegal expense 2,509 3,110 (601) (19.3%)\nFDIC insurance 2,618 2,233 385 17.2%\nSoftware 13,687 12,981 706 5.4%\nInsurance 3,866 3,935 (69) (1.8%)\nTelecom and IT network communications 908 1,044 (136) (13.0%)\nConsulting 1,558 1,412 146 10.3%\nWrite-downs and other losses on OREO — 1,315 (1,315) (100.0%)\nOther 14,887 14,286 601 4.2%\nTotal non-interest expense $ 151,413 $ 145,432 $ 5,981 4.1%\nChanges in non-interest expense were as follows:\n(cid:0)x Salaries and employee benefits expense increased to $98.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of $4.5 million, or 4.9%, from\n$93.4 million for the first nine months of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Depreciation expense increased $977,000, or 47.8%, to $3.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $2.0 million in the first nine months of 2023,\nreflecting the impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n(cid:0)x Rent and related occupancy cost increased $795,000, or 18.6%, to $5.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $4.3 million in the first nine\nmonths of 2023, reflecting the impact of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota relocation to new and expanded offices and a new expanded data center.\n(cid:0)x Data processing expense increased $129,000, or 3.1%, to $4.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $4.1 million in the first nine months of\n2023, reflecting higher transaction volume.\n(cid:0)x Audit expense decreased $174,000, or 13.9%, to $1.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $1.3 million in the first nine months of 2023.\n(cid:0)x Legal expense decreased $601,000, or 19.3%, to $2.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $3.1 million in the first nine months of 2023,\nreflecting a reimbursement of legal fees related to the Del Mar complaint described in “Note O.

The $601,000 increase reflected a $1.2 million loss from a transaction processing delay and a $989,000 increase in OREO expense offset by\nthe following decreases: (i) regulatory examination fees of $272,000 and (ii) other operating taxes of $359,000. The $989,000 increase in OREO\nexpense, reflected expenses on the $39.4 million apartment property transferred to OREO in the second quarter of 2024, as described in “Note 6.\nLoans.” The balance as of September 30, 2024 was $40.3 million.\n50\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $54.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to $49.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase resulted\nprimarily from an increase in income, substantially all of which is subject to income tax. A 25.1% effective tax rate in 2024 and a 24.9% effective tax rate in\n2023 primarily reflected a 21% federal tax rate and the impact of various state income taxes.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity defines our ability to generate funds at a reasonable cost to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals, satisfy borrowing needs and otherwise\noperate on an ongoing basis. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution’s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected\ncash flows without adversely affecting daily operations or financial condition. The Company’s liquidity management policy requirements include sustaining\ndefined liquidity minimums, concentration monitoring and management, stress testing, contingency planning and related oversight. Based on our sources of\nfunding and liquidity discussed below, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for our needs in the next 12 months and for the\nforeseeable future. We invest the funds we do not need for daily operations primarily in overnight federal funds or in our interest-bearing account at the Federal\nReserve. We actively monitor our positions and contingent funding sources daily.\nOur primary source of funding has been deposits. Average total deposits increased by $720.9 million, or 11.5%, to $7.01 billion for the third quarter of 2024\ncompared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase reflected the planned exit of higher cost deposits. Federal Reserve average balances decreased to\n$247.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $639.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease reflected approximately $900 million of securities\npurchases in April 2024 as discussed under “Asset and Liability Management” in this MD&A. Additionally, as a result of those purchases, we have increased\nthe use of FHLB advances to partially fund such purchases, at least temporarily, and those advances averaged approximately $73.5 million for third quarter\n2024.\nOne source of contingent liquidity is available-for-sale securities, which amounted to $1.59 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $747.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, reflecting $900 million of securities purchases in April, 2024. In excess of $1.0 billion of these securities, including those $900 million of\nApril 2024 purchases, can be pledged to facilitate extensions of credit in addition to loans already pledged against lines of credit, as discussed later in this\nsection. At September 30, 2024, outstanding loans amounted to $5.91 billion, compared to $5.36 billion at the prior year end, an increase of $545.5 million\nrepresenting a use of funds. Commercial loans, at fair value, decreased to $252.0 million from $332.8 million between those respective dates, a decrease of\n$80.8 million, which provided funding. In 2019 and previous years, these loans were generally originated for securitization and sale, but in 2020 we decided to\nretain such loans on the balance sheet. While we suspended originating such loans after the first quarter of 2020, we resumed originations, which consist\nprimarily of non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans, in the third quarter of 2021. Such originations are held for investment and are included in “Loans,\nnet of deferred loan fees and costs” on the balance sheet. Accordingly, commercial loans, at fair value will continue to run off. Our liquidity planning has not\npreviously placed undue reliance on securitizations, and while our future planning excludes the impact of securitizations, other liquidity sources, primarily\ndeposits, are determined to be adequate.\nWhile we do not have a traditional branch system, we believe that our core deposits, which include our demand, interest checking, savings and money market\naccounts, have similar characteristics to those of a bank with a branch system. The majority of our deposit accounts are obtained with the assistance of third-\nparties and as a result have historically been classified as brokered by the FDIC. Prior to December 2020, FDIC guidance for classification of deposit accounts\nas brokered was relatively broad, and generally included accounts which were referred to or “placed” with the institution by other companies. If the Bank ceases\nto be categorized as “well capitalized” under banking regulations, it will be prohibited from accepting, renewing or rolling over any of its deposits classified as\nbrokered without the consent of the FDIC. In such a case, the FDIC’s refusal to grant consent to our accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits could\neffectively restrict or eliminate the ability of the Bank to operate its business lines as presently conducted. In December 2020, the FDIC issued a new regulation\nwhich, in the third quarter of 2021, resulted in the majority of our deposits being reclassified from brokered to non-brokered. On July 30, 2024, the FDIC\nproposed a regulation eliminating certain automatic exceptions which resulted in the reclassification of significant amounts of our deposits from brokered to\nnon-brokered as a result of the December 2020 rules changes, while retaining the ability of financial institutions to reapply. If the proposed regulation is\nadopted, significant amounts of our deposits could be reclassified as brokered, which could also result in an increase in our federal deposit insurance rate and\nexpense. Of our total deposits of $6.93 billion as of September 30, 2024, $586.8 million were classified as brokered and an estimated $485.3 million were not\ninsured by FDIC insurance, which requires identification of the depositor and is limited to $250,000 per identified depositor. Uninsured accounts may represent\na greater liquidity risk than FDIC-insured accounts should large depositors withdraw funds as a result of negative financial developments either at the Bank or\nin the economy. Significant amounts of our uninsured deposits are comprised of small balances, such as anonymous gift cards and corporate incentive cards for\nwhich there is no identified depositor. We do not believe that such uninsured accounts present a significant liquidity risk.\nCertain components of our deposits experience seasonality, creating greater excess liquidity at certain times. The largest deposit inflows occur in the first\nquarter of the year when certain of our accounts are credited with tax refund payments from the U.S. Treasury.\n51\nWhile consumer deposit accounts, including prepaid and debit card accounts, comprise the vast majority of our funding needs, we maintain secured borrowing\nlines with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve. Our collateralized line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank had available accessible capacity of $1.97 billion\nas of September 30, 2024, and was collateralized by loans. We have also pledged in excess of $2.21 billion of multifamily loans to the FHLB. As a result, we\nhave approximately $1.11 billion of availability on that line of credit which we can also access at any time. There was $135.0 million drawn against the FHLB\nline at September 30, 2024. We expect to continue to maintain our facilities with the FHLB and Federal Reserve.\nAs a holding company conducting substantially all our business through our subsidiaries, the Company’s near-term need for liquidity consists principally of\ncash for required interest payments on our subordinated debentures, consisting of 2038 Debentures, and senior debt, consisting of $100.0 million senior notes\nwith an interest rate of 4.75% and maturing in August 2025 (the “2025 Senior Notes”). Semi-annual interest payments on the 2025 Senior Notes are\napproximately $2.4 million, and quarterly interest payments on the 2038 Debentures are approximately $300,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash\nreserves of approximately $8.9 million at the holding company. Stock repurchases are funded by dividends from the Bank, as are interest payments on the\nabove debt instruments. Stock repurchases may be terminated at any time. The holding company’s sources of liquidity are primarily comprised of dividends\npaid by the Bank to the Company, and the issuance of debt.\nIncluded in our cash and cash-equivalents at September 30, 2024 were $47.1 million of interest-earning deposits which primarily consisted of deposits with the\nFederal Reserve.\nIn 2024, $179.9 million of redemptions were exceeded by purchases of $969.4 million of securities. We had outstanding commitments to fund loans, including\nunused lines of credit, of $1.77 billion and $1.79 billion as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority of our commitments are\nvariable rate and originate with SBLOC. The recorded amount of such commitments has, for many accounts, been based on the full amount of collateral in a\ncustomer’s investment account. The funding requirements for such commitments occur on a measured basis over time and would be funded by normal deposit\ngrowth. Additionally, these loans are “demand” loans and as such, represent a contingent source of funding.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\nWe must comply with capital adequacy guidelines issued by our regulators. A bank must, in general, have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.00%, a ratio of Tier I\ncapital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10.0% and a ratio of common equity tier 1 to risk weighted assets of\n6.5% to be considered “well capitalized.” The Tier I leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets for the quarter. “Tier I capital” includes\ncommon shareholders’ equity, certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less\nintangibles. At September 30, 2024, the Bank was “well capitalized” under banking regulations.\nThe following table sets forth our regulatory capital amounts and ratios for the periods indicated:\nTier 1 capital Tier 1 capital Total capital Common equity\nto average to risk-weighted to risk-weighted tier 1 to risk\nassets ratio assets ratio assets ratio weighted assets\nAs of September 30, 2024\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 9.86% 13.62% 14.19% 13.62%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 10.94% 15.11% 15.67% 15.11%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\nAs of December 31, 2023\nThe Bancorp, Inc. 11.19% 15.66% 16.23% 15.66%\nThe Bancorp Bank, National Association 12.37% 17.35% 17.92% 17.35%\n\"Well capitalized\" institution (under federal regulations-Basel III) 5.00% 8.00% 10.00% 6.50%\nAsset and Liability Management\nThe management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is essential to controlling interest rate risk and optimizing interest margins. An interest rate sensitive asset\nor liability is one that, within a defined time period, either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market rates. Interest rate\nsensitivity measures the relative volatility of an institution’s interest margin resulting from changes in market interest rates. While it is difficult to predict the\nimpact of inflation and responsive Federal Reserve rate changes on our net interest income, the Federal Reserve has historically utilized increases in the\novernight federal funds rate as one tool in fighting inflation. As a result of high rates of inflation, the Federal Reserve raised rates in each quarter of 2022 and in\nthe first three quarters of 2023. In the third quarter of 2024 the Federal Reserve began lowering rates. Our largest funding source, prepaid and debit card deposit\naccounts, contractually adjusts to only a portion of increases or decreases in rates which are largely determined by such Federal Reserve actions. That pricing\nhas generally supported the maintenance of a balance sheet for which net interest income tends to increase with increases in rates. While deposits reprice to only\na portion of Federal Reserve rate changes, such changes are immediate. Interest-earning\n52\nassets, comprised primarily of loans and securities, tend to adjust more fully to rate increases at lagged contractual pricing intervals. The majority of our loans\nand securities are variable rate and generally reprice monthly or quarterly, although some reprice over several years. Additionally, the impact of loan interest\nrate floors which must be exceeded before rates on certain loans increase, may result in decreases in net interest income with lesser increases in rates.\nCumulative 2022 Federal Reserve interest rate increases resulted in contractual rates on loans generally exceeding rate floors beginning in the second quarter of\n2022.\nWe have adopted policies designed to manage net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements. To effectively administer\nthe policies and to monitor our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintain an asset/liability committee, consisting of the Bank’s Chief Executive\nOfficer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer and others. This committee meets quarterly to review our financial results,\ndevelop strategies to optimize margins and to respond to market conditions. The primary goal of our policies is to optimize margins and manage interest rate\nrisk, subject to overall policy constraints for prudent management of interest rate risk.\nWe monitor, manage and control interest rate risk through a variety of techniques, including the use of traditional interest rate sensitivity analysis (also known\nas “gap analysis”) and an interest rate risk management model. With the interest rate risk management model, we project future net interest income and then\nestimate the effect of various changes in interest rates on that projected net interest income. We also use the interest rate risk management model to calculate the\nchange in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios. Traditional gap analysis involves arranging our interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities by repricing periods and then computing the difference (or “interest rate sensitivity gap”) between the assets and liabilities that we estimate\nwill reprice during each time period and cumulatively through the end of each time period.\nBoth interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis are done at a specific point in time and involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions.\nInterest rate sensitivity modeling requires, among other things, estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest-earning\nassets and interest-bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates, future cash flows and discount rates. Gap analysis requires estimates as to\nwhen individual categories of interest-sensitive assets and liabilities will re-price, and assumes that assets and liabilities assigned to the same repricing period\nwill reprice at the same time and in the same amount. Gap analysis does not account for the fact that repricing of assets and liabilities is discretionary and\nsubject to competitive and other pressures. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate\nsensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets. During a period of\nfalling interest rates, a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest\nincome. During a period of rising interest rates, a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to\naffect net interest income adversely.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing structure of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at September 30, 2024.\nExcept as stated below, the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the\ncontractual terms of each asset or liability. The majority of transaction and savings balances are assumed to be “core” deposits, or deposits that will generally\nremain with us regardless of market interest rates. We estimate the repricing characteristics of these deposits based on historical performance, past experience,\njudgmental predictions and other deposit behavior assumptions. However, we may choose not to reprice liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest\nrates for competitive or other reasons. Additionally, although non-interest-bearing transaction accounts are not paid interest, we estimate certain of the balances\nwill reprice as a result of the contractual fees that are paid to the affinity groups which are based upon a rate index, and therefore are included in interest\nexpense. We have adjusted the transaction account balances in the table downward, to better reflect the impact of their partial adjustment to changes in rates.\nLoans and security balances, which adjust more fully to market rate changes, are based upon actual balances. The table does not assume any prepayment of\nfixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow, including prepayments based on historical data and current\nmarket trends. The table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on our net interest income because the repricing and related\nbehavior of certain categories of assets and liabilities (for example, prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits) is beyond our control. As a result, certain\nassets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a stated period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels. For instance, the majority of\nREBL loans are variable rate with floors, but prepayments may offset the benefit of such floors in decreasing rate environments.\n53\n1-90 91-364 1-3 3-5 Over 5\nDays Days Years Years Years\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest-earning assets:\nCommercial loans, at fair value $ 97,651 $ 70,063 $ 36,693 $ 45,639 $ 1,958\nLoans, net of deferred loan fees and costs 3,272,423 361,862 1,412,639 661,164 198,528\nInvestment securities 287,224 90,039 113,612 222,872 874,542\nInterest-earning deposits 47,105 — — — —\nTotal interest-earning assets 3,704,403 521,964 1,562,944 929,675 1,075,028\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nTransaction accounts as adjusted(1) 3,422,064 — — — —\nSavings and money market 81,624 — — — —\nShort-term borrowings 135,000 — — — —\nSenior debt and subordinated debentures 13,401 96,125 — — —\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,652,089 96,125 — — —\nGap $ 52,314 $ 425,839 $ 1,562,944 $ 929,675 $ 1,075,028\nCumulative gap $ 52,314 $ 478,153 $ 2,041,097 $ 2,970,772 $ 4,045,800\nGap to assets ratio 1% 5% 19% 12% 13%\nCumulative gap to assets ratio 1% 6% 25% 37% 50%\n(1) Transaction accounts are comprised primarily of demand deposits. While demand deposits are non-interest-bearing, related fees paid to affinity groups may reprice according to specified indices.\nThe methods used to analyze interest rate sensitivity in this table have a number of limitations. Certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in\ninterest rates even though they reprice or mature in the same or similar time periods. The interest rates on certain assets and liabilities may change at different\ntimes than market interest rates, with some changing in advance of changes in market rates and some lagging behind changes in market rates. Additionally, the\nactual prepayments and withdrawals we experience when interest rates change may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the data shown in\nthe table. Accordingly, actual results can and often do differ from projections.\nWe believe that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable; however, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments, as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income, could vary\nsubstantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from presumed behavior of various deposit and loan categories. The following table\nshows the effects of interest rate shocks on our net portfolio value described as Market Value of Portfolio Equity (“MVPE”) and net interest income. Rate\nshocks assume that current interest rates change immediately and sustain parallel shifts. For interest rate increases or decreases of 100 and 200 basis points, our\npolicy includes a guideline that our MVPE ratio should not decrease more than 10% and 15%, respectively, and that net interest income should not decrease\nmore than 10% and 15%, respectively. As illustrated in the following table, we complied with our asset/liability policy guidelines at September 30, 2024. While\nour modeling suggests that rate increases of 100 and 200 basis points will have a positive impact on net interest income (as shown in the table below), the actual\namount of such increase cannot be determined, and there can be no assurance any increase will be realized. Because the Company has emphasized variable rate\ninstruments in its loan and investment portfolios, it tends to benefit from higher interest rate environments. As a result of the Federal Reserve rate increases in\n2022 and 2023, net interest income has increased and exceeded prior period levels. Future Federal Reserve rate reductions may result in a return to lower net\ninterest income levels. In April 2024, the Company purchased approximately $900 million of fixed rate commercial and residential mortgage securities of\nvarying maturities to reduce its exposure to lower levels of net interest income, in anticipation of Federal Reserve rate reductions. In September 2024, the\nFederal Reserve began to lower rates. Such purchases would also reduce the additional net interest income which would result should the Federal Reserve\nincrease rates. Those purchases had respective estimated weighted average yields and lives of approximately 5.11% and eight years.\nNet portfo lio val ue at Net inter est inco me\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nPercentage Percentage\nRate scenario Amount change Amount change\n(Dollars in thousands)\n+200 basis points $ 1,290,352 (0.18%) $ 398,838 3.24%\n+100 basis points 1,291,651 (0.08%) 392,592 1.62%\nFlat rate 1,292,728 — 386,330 —\n-100 basis points 1,281,804 (0.85%) 379,965 (1.65%)\n-200 basis points 1,262,175 (2.36%) 374,342 (3.10%)\n54\nFinancial Condition\nGeneral. Our total assets at September 30, 2024 were $8.09 billion, of which our total loans were $5.91 billion, and our commercial loans, at fair value, were\n$252.0 million. At December 31, 2023, our total assets were $7.71 billion, of which our total loans were $5.36 billion, and our commercial loans, at fair value\nwere $332.8 million. The increase in assets reflected an increase in available-for-sale securities, which resulted from the previously discussed $900 million of\nApril 2024 securities purchases. The increase also reflected loan growth in various loan categories, which offset decreases both in SBLOC and IBLOC loan\nbalances and in commercial loans, at fair value as that portfolio continues to run off.\nInterest-earning Deposits\nAt September 30, 2024, we had a total of $47.1 million of interest-earning deposits compared to $1.03 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of\n$986.2 million. These deposits were comprised primarily of balances at the Federal Reserve. The decrease reflected the utilization of these overnight balances\nfor the aforementioned securities purchases in the second quarter of 2024.\nInvestment Portfolio\nFor detailed information on the composition and maturity distribution of our investment portfolio, see “Note 5. Investment Securities” to the unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements herein. Total investment securities increased to $1.59 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $840.8 million, or 112.5%,\nfrom December 31, 2023, as a result of the aforementioned $900 million of securities purchases in April 2024.\nUnder the accounting guidance related to CECL, changes in fair value of securities unrelated to credit losses continue to be recognized through equity.\nHowever, credit-related losses are recognized through an allowance, rather than through a reduction in the amortized cost of the security. CECL accounting\nguidance also permits the reversal of allowances for credit deterioration in future periods based on improvements in credit, which was not included in previous\nguidance. Generally, a security’s credit-related loss is the difference between its amortized cost basis and the best estimate of its expected future cash flows\ndiscounted at the security’s effective yield. That difference is recognized through the income statement, as with prior guidance, but is renamed a provision for\ncredit loss. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized no credit-related losses on our portfolio.\nInvestments in FHLB, ACBB and Federal Reserve Bank stock are recorded at cost and amounted to $21.7 million at September 30, 2024 and $15.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. Each of these institutions require their correspondent banking institutions to hold stock as a condition of membership. The Bank’s\nconversion to a national charter required the purchase of $11.0 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock in September 2022. Additionally, in the second quarter of\n2023, we joined the FHLB of Des Moines, which required a $9.1 million purchase of stock. While a fixed stock amount is required by each of these institutions,\nthe FHLB stock requirement increases or decreases with the level of borrowing activity.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 no investment securities were encumbered, as lines of credit established for borrowings were collateralized by\nloans.\nThe following table shows the contractual maturity distribution and the weighted average yield of our investment portfolio securities as of September 30, 2024\n(dollars in thousands). The weighted average yield was calculated by dividing the amount of individual securities to total securities in each category,\nmultiplying by the yield of the individual security and adding the results of those individual computations.\nAfter After\nZero one to five to Over\nto one Average five Average ten Average ten Average\nAvailable-for-sale year yield years yield years yield years yield Total\nU.S. Government agency securities $ 1,128 2.48% $ 6,550 2.79% $ 14,870 4.95% $ 8,470 3.86% $ 31,018\nAsset-backed securities 2,748 7.07% 10,565 6.88% 178,605 6.84% 45,006 6.64% 236,924\nTax-exempt obligations of states and political\nsubdivisions(1) 1,000 3.10% 1,869 2.65% 2,017 3.87% 3,045 4.50% 7,931\nTaxable obligations of states and political\nsubdivisions 14,708 3.15% 19,125 3.42% 1,174 4.33% — — 35,007\nResidential mortgage-backed securities — — 279 2.60% 5,096 4.55% 458,233 5.01% 463,608\nCollateralized mortgage obligation securities — — 4,302 2.75% 14 3.39% 24,177 3.93% 28,493\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities 41,650 2.37% 88,207 3.45% 538,883 4.82% 116,568 4.21% 785,308\nTotal $ 61,234 $ 130,897 $ 740,659 $ 655,499 $ 1,588,289\nWeighted average yield 2.78% 3.65% 5.30% 4.92%\n(1) If adjusted to their taxable equivalents, yields would approximate 3.92%, 3.35%, 4.90%, and 5.70% for zero to one year, one to five years, five to ten years, and over ten years, respectively, at a\nfederal tax rate of 21%.\n55\nPrior to 2020, the Company sponsored the structuring of commercial mortgage loan securitizations, and in 2020, the Company decided not to pursue additional\nsecuritizations. The loans previously sold to the commercial mortgage-backed securitizations were transitional commercial mortgage loans made to improve\nand rehabilitate existing properties which already had cash flow. Servicing rights were not retained. Each of the securitizations is considered a variable interest\nentity of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Further, true sale accounting has been applicable to each of the securitizations, as supported by a\nreview performed by an independent third-party consultant. In each of the securitizations, the Company obtained a tranche of certificates which are accounted\nfor as available-for-sale debt securities. The securities were recorded at fair value at acquisition, which was determined by an independent third-party based on\nthe discounted cash flow method using unobservable (level 3) inputs.\nOf the six securities purchased by the Bank from our securitizations, all have been repaid except one issued by CRE-2, which is included in the commercial\nmortgage-backed securities classification in investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance of the Bank’s CRE-2-issued security was\n$12.6 million, and it is subordinate to the repayment of a senior tranche with a remaining balance of $1.5 million and servicer obligations of $2.0 million. Thus,\na total of $16.1 million is required for the Bank’s tranche to be repaid. The sole repayment source for the $16.1 million consists of the disposition of a suburban\noffice building in New Jersey and a retail facility in Missouri. In the second quarter of 2024, the Bank received updated appraisals from the servicer for both\nproperties which lowered estimated combined appraised values to $23.7 million. The excess of the $23.7 million appraised values over the $16.1 million to be\nrepaid provides repayment protection for the Bank-owned tranche and accrued interest thereon. As a result of the reduced excess of appraised value over the\nBank’s principal and accruing interest, the $12.6 million principal was placed in nonaccrual status and $1.3 million was reversed from securities interest in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. While the appraised values allocable to the Bank’s security exceed the principal and unpaid interest, there can be no assurance as to the\namounts received upon the servicer’s disposition of these properties, which will reflect additional servicing fees, actual disposition prices and other disposition\ncosts. The New Jersey suburban office complex is being marketed by the debtor in possession who expects a contract for sale by the end of 2024. The Missouri\nretail facility is held as real estate owned by the security’s trust and a sale is in process.\nCommercial Loans, at Fair Value\nCommercial loans, at fair value are comprised of non-SBA commercial real estate loans and SBA loans which had been originated for sale or securitization\nthrough the first quarter of 2020, and which are now being held on the balance sheet. SBA loans are valued on a pooled basis and commercial real estate bridge\nloans are valued individually. Commercial loans, at fair value decreased to $252.0 million at September 30, 2024 from $332.8 million at December 31, 2023,\nprimarily reflecting the impact of loan repayments as this portfolio runs off. These loans continue to be accounted for at fair value. In the third quarter of 2021\nwe resumed originating non-SBA commercial real estate loans, after suspending such originations in the first quarter of 2020. These originations reflect lending\ncriteria similar to the existing loan portfolio and are primarily comprised of multifamily (apartment buildings) collateral. The new originations, which are\nintended to be held for investment, are accounted for at amortized cost.\nLoan Portfolio. Total loans increased to $5.91 billion at September 30, 2024 from $5.36 billion at December 31, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes our loan portfolio, excluding loans held at fair value, by loan category for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBL non-real estate $ 179,915 $ 137,752\nSBL commercial mortgage 665,608 606,986\nSBL construction 30,158 22,627\nSBLs 875,681 767,365\nDirect lease financing 711,836 685,657\nSBLOC / IBLOC(1) 1,543,215 1,627,285\nAdvisor financing(2) 248,422 221,612\nReal estate bridge loans 2,189,761 1,999,782\nConsumer fintech(3) 280,092 —\nOther loans(4) 46,586 50,638\n5,895,593 5,352,339\nUnamortized loan fees and costs 11,023 8,800\nTotal loans, including unamortized loan fees and costs $ 5,906,616 $ 5,361,139\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSBLs, including costs net of deferred fees of $9,582 and $9,502\nfor September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively $ 885,263 $ 776,867\nSBLs included in commercial loans, at fair value 93,888 119,287\nTotal SBLs(5) $ 979,151 $ 896,154\n(1) SBLOC are collateralized by marketable securities, while IBLOC, are collateralized by the cash surrender value of insurance policies.

Maximum loan amounts are subject to LTV ratios of\n70% of the business enterprise value based on a third-party valuation but may be increased depending upon the debt service coverage ratio. Personal guarantees and blanket business liens are obtained\nas appropriate.\n(3) Consumer fintech loans included $111.0 million of secured credit card loans, with the balance consisting of other short-term extensions of credit..\n(4) Includes demand deposit overdrafts reclassified as loan balances totaling $960,000 and $1.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

While the value of equities has fallen in excess of\n30% in recent years, the reduction in collateral value of brokerage accounts collateralizing SBLOCs generally has been less. This is because many collateral\naccounts are “balanced” and accordingly, have a component of debt securities, which have either not decreased in value as much as equities, or in some cases\nmay have increased in value. Further, many of these accounts have the benefit of professional investment advisors who provided some protection against\nmarket downturns, through diversification and other means. Additionally, borrowers often utilize only a portion of collateral value, which lowers the percentage\nof principal to the market value of collateral.\nThe following table summarizes our ten largest SBLOC loans as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nPrincipal amount % Principal to collateral\n$ 9,465 41%\n8,319 84%\n8,031 62%\n7,904 63%\n7,356 44%\n5,334 57%\n5,204 65%\n4,996 58%\n4,962 56%\n4,894 43%\nTotal and weighted average $ 66,465 58%\n59\nIBLOC loans are backed by the cash value of life insurance policies which have been assigned to us.

For detailed information on the ACL methodology, see “Note 6.

The increase reflected the impact of a new qualitative factor for classified REBL loans, as the provision for credit losses was accordingly increased by\n$2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024.

In addition to the review of all loans classified as either\nspecial mention or substandard, the targeted coverages and scope of the reviews are risk-based and vary according to each portfolio as follows:\nSBLOC – The targeted review threshold is 40%, including a sample focusing on the largest 25% of SBLOCs by commitment. A random sample of at least\ntwenty loans will be reviewed each quarter. At September 30, 2024, approximately 49% of the SBLOC portfolio had been reviewed.\nIBLOC – The targeted review threshold is 40%, including a sample focusing on the largest 25% of IBLOCs by commitment. A random sample of at least twenty\nloans will be reviewed each quarter. At September 30, 2024, approximately 57% of the IBLOC portfolio had been reviewed.\nAdvisor Financing – The targeted review threshold is 50%. At September 30, 2024, approximately 88% of the advisor financing portfolio had been reviewed.\nThe loan balance review threshold is $1.0 million.\nSBLs – The targeted review threshold is 60%, to be rated and/or reviewed within 90 days of funding, excluding fully guaranteed loans purchased for CRA\npurposes, and fully guaranteed PPP loans. The loan balance review threshold is $1.5 million and additionally includes any classified loans. At September 30,\n2024, approximately 70% of the non-government guaranteed SBL loan portfolio had been reviewed.\nDirect Lease Financing – The targeted review threshold is 35%. At September 30, 2024, approximately 57% of the leasing portfolio had been reviewed. The\nloan balance review threshold is $1.5 million.\nCommercial Real Estate Bridge Loans, at fair value and Commercial Real Estate Bridge Loans, at amortized cost (floating rate, excluding SBA, which are\nincluded in SBLs above) – The targeted review threshold is 60%. Floating rate loans will be reviewed initially within 90 days of funding and will be monitored\non an ongoing basis as to payment status. Subsequent reviews will be performed for relationships over $10.0 million. At September 30, 2024, approximately\n100% of the floating rate, non-SBA commercial real estate bridge loans outstanding for more than 90 days had been reviewed.\n63\nCommercial Real Estate Loans, at fair value (fixed rate, excluding SBA, which are included in SBLs above) – The targeted review threshold is 100%. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, approximately 100% of the fixed rate, non-SBA commercial real estate loan portfolio had been reviewed.\nOther minor loan categories are reviewed at the discretion of the loan review department.\nThe following tables present delinquencies by type of loan as of the dates specified (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\n30-59 days 60-89 days 90+ days Total past due Total\npast due past due still accruing Non-accrual and non-accrual Current loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 72 $ 322 $ 758 $ 3,047 $ 4,199 $ 175,716 $ 179,915\nSBL commercial mortgage — — 336 4,898 5,234 660,374 665,608\nSBL construction — — — 1,585 1,585 28,573 30,158\nDirect lease financing 5,791 12,883 1,260 3,919 23,853 687,983 711,836\nSBLOC / IBLOC 10,251 2,014 2,383 — 14,648 1,528,567 1,543,215\nAdvisor financing — — — — — 248,422 248,422\nReal estate bridge loans(1) — — — 12,300 12,300 2,177,461 2,189,761\nConsumer fintech 4,021 4 — — 4,025 276,067 280,092\nOther loans — — — — — 46,586 46,586\nUnamortized loan fees and costs — — — — — 11,023 11,023\n$ 20,135 $ 15,223 $ 4,737 $ 25,749 $ 65,844 $ 5,840,772 $ 5,906,616\nDecember 31, 2023\n30-59 days 60-89 days 90+ days Total past due Total\npast due past due still accruing Non-accrual and non-accrual Current loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 84 $ 333 $ 336 $ 1,842 $ 2,595 $ 135,157 $ 137,752\nSBL commercial mortgage 2,183 — — 2,381 4,564 602,422 606,986\nSBL construction — — — 3,385 3,385 19,242 22,627\nDirect lease financing 5,163 1,209 485 3,785 10,642 675,015 685,657\nSBLOC / IBLOC 21,934 3,607 745 — 26,286 1,600,999 1,627,285\nAdvisor financing — — — — — 221,612 221,612\nReal estate bridge loans — — — — — 1,999,782 1,999,782\nConsumer fintech — — — — — — —\nOther loans 853 76 178 132 1,239 49,399 50,638\nUnamortized loan fees and costs — — — — — 8,800 8,800\n$ 30,217 $ 5,225 $ 1,744 $ 11,525 $ 48,711 $ 5,312,428 $ 5,361,139\n(1) The $12.3 million shown in the non-accrual column for real estate bridge loans is collateralized by apartment building property with respective 72% and 56% “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs,\nrespectively, based upon a May 2024 appraisal. “As stabilized” LTVs represent additional potential collateral value as rehabilitation progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental rates. The\ntable above does not include an $11.2 million loan accounted for at fair value, and, as such, not reflected in delinquency tables. In third quarter 2024, the borrower notified the Company that he would\nno longer be making payments on the loan, which is collateralized by a vacant retail property. Based upon a July 2024 appraisal, the “as is” LTV is 84% and the “as stabilized” LTV is 62%. Since\n2021, real estate bridge lending originations have consisted of apartment buildings, while this loan was originated previously.\nAlthough we consider our ACL to be adequate based on information currently available, future additions to the ACL may be necessary due to changes in\neconomic conditions, our ongoing loss experience and that of our peers, changes in management’s assumptions as to future delinquencies, recoveries and losses,\ndeterioration of specific credits and management’s intent with regard to the disposition of loans and leases.\nManagement estimates the ACL quarterly and for most loan categories uses relevant available internal and external historical loan performance information to\ndetermine the quantitative component of the reserve, and current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts and other factors to determine\nthe qualitative component of the reserve. Reserves on specific credit-deteriorated loans comprise the third and final component of the reserve. Historical credit\nloss experience provides the quantitative basis for the estimation of expected credit losses over the estimated remaining life of the loans. The qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL is designed to be responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and the impact of current and future economic conditions on loan\nperformance, and is subjective. The review of the appropriateness of the ACL is performed by the Chief Credit Officer and presented to the Audit Committee of\nthe Company’s Board of Directors for review. With the exception of SBLOC and IBLOC, which utilize probability of default/loss given default, and the other\nloan category, which uses discounted cash flow to determine a reserve, the quantitative components for remaining categories are determined by establishing\nreserves on loan pools with similar risk characteristics based on a lifetime loss-rate model, or vintage analysis, as described in the following paragraph. Loans\nthat do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. If foreclosure is believed to be probable or repayment is expected from the sale of\ncollateral, a reserve for deficiency is established within the ACL. Those reserves are estimated based on the difference between loan principal and the estimated\nfair value of the collateral, adjusted for estimated disposition costs.\n64\nExcept for SBLOC, IBLOC and other loans as noted above, for purposes of determining the quantitative historical loss reserve for each similar risk pool, the\nloans not assigned an individual reserve are segregated by product type, to recognize differing risk characteristics within portfolio segments, and an average\nhistorical loss rate is calculated for each product type. Loss rates are computed by classifying net charge-offs by year of loan origination and dividing into total\noriginations for that specific year. This methodology is referred to as vintage analysis. The average loss rate is then projected over the estimated remaining loan\nlives unique to each loan pool, to determine estimated lifetime losses. For SBLOC and IBLOC, since de minimis losses have been incurred, probability of\ndefault/loss given default considerations are utilized. For the other loan category discounted cash flow is utilized to determine a reserve. The Company also\nconsiders the need for an additional ACL based upon qualitative factors such as current loan performance statistics by pool, and economic conditions. These\nqualitative factors are intended to account for forward looking expectations over a twelve to eighteen month period not reflected in historical loss rates and\notherwise unaccounted for in the quantitative process. Accordingly, such factors may increase or decrease the allowance compared to historical loss rates as the\nCompany’s forward-looking expectations change. The qualitative factor percentages are applied against the pool balances as of the end of the period. Aside\nfrom the qualitative adjustments to account for forward looking expectations of loss over a twelve to eighteen month projection period, the balance of the ACL\nreverts to the Company’s quantitative analysis derived from its historical loss rates. The qualitative and quantitative historical loss rate components, together\nwith the allowances on specific credit-deteriorated loans, comprise the total ACL.\nA similar process is employed to calculate an ACL assigned to off-balance sheet commitments, which are comprised of unfunded loan commitments and letters\nof credit. That ACL for unfunded commitments is recorded in other liabilities. Even though portions of the ACL may be allocated to loans that have been\nindividually measured for credit deterioration, the entire ACL is available for any credit that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off.\nAt September 30, 2024, the ACL amounted to $31.0 million of which $11.4 million of allowances resulted from the Company’s historical charge-off ratios, $3.5\nmillion from reserves on specific loans, with the balance comprised of the qualitative components. The $11.4 million resulted primarily from SBA non-real\nestate lending and leasing charge-offs. The proportion of qualitative reserves compared to charge-off history related reserves reflects the general absence of\ncharge-offs in the Company’s largest loan portfolios consisting of SBLOC and IBLOC and real estate bridge lending which results, at least in part, from the\nnature of related collateral. Such collateral respectively consists of marketable securities, the cash value of life insurance and workforce apartment buildings. As\ncharge-offs are nonetheless possible, significant subjectivity is required to consider qualitative factors to derive the related components of the allowance.\nThe Company ranks its qualitative factors in five levels: minimal, low, moderate, moderate-high, and high-risk. The individual qualitative factors for each\nportfolio segment have their own scale based on an analysis of that segment. A high-risk ranking results in the largest increase in the ACL calculation with each\nlevel below having a lesser impact on a sliding scale. The qualitative factors used for each portfolio are described below in the description of each portfolio\nsegment. As a result of continuing economic uncertainty in 2022, including heightened inflation and increased risks of recession, the qualitative factors which\nhad previously been set in anticipation of a downturn, were maintained through the third quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, as risks of a recession\nincreased, the economic qualitative risk factor was increased for non-real estate SBL and leasing. Those higher qualitative allocations were retained in the first\nquarter of 2023, as negative economic indications persisted. In the second quarter of 2023, CECL model adjustments of $1.7 million resulted from a $2.5\nmillion CECL model decrease from changes in estimated average lives, partially offset by a $794,000 CECL model increase resulting from increasing economic\nand collateral risk factors to respective moderate-high and moderate risk levels. The elevated economic risk level for leasing reflected input from department\nheads regarding the potential borrower impact of the higher rate environment. The elevated collateral risk level for leasing reflected lower auction prices for\nvehicles and uncertainty over the extent to which such prices might decrease in the future. The adjustment for average lives reflected a change in the estimated\nlives of leases, higher variances for which may result from their short maturities. In the third quarter of 2023, there were indications of auction price\nstabilization, while the auto workers’ strike could reduce supply and drive up prices. Nonetheless, the elevated risk levels were maintained. In the second\nquarter of 2024, the provision for credit losses was reduced by $1.4 million to reflect reduced average lives for small business non-real estate loans.\nThe Company has not increased the qualitative risk levels for SBLOC or IBLOC because of the nature of related collateral. SBLOC loans are subject to\nmaximum loan to marketable securities value, and notwithstanding historic drops in the stock market in recent years, losses have not been realized. IBLOC\nloans are limited to borrowers with insurance companies that exceed credit requirements, and loan amounts are limited to life insurance cash values. The\nCompany had not, prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, increased the economic factor for multifamily real estate bridge lending. While Federal Reserve rate\nincreases directly increase real estate bridge loan floating-rate borrowing costs, those borrowers are required to purchase interest rate caps that will partially\nlimit the increase in borrowing costs during the term of the loan. Additionally, there continues to be several additional mitigating factors within the multifamily\nsector that should continue to fuel demand. Higher interest rates are increasing the cost to purchase a home, which in turn is increasing the number of renters\nand subsequent demand for multifamily. The softening demand for new homes should continue to exacerbate the current housing shortage, and therefore\ncontinue to fuel demand for multifamily apartment homes. Additionally, higher rents in the multifamily sector are causing renters to be more price sensitive,\nwhich is driving demand for most of the apartment buildings within the Company’s loan portfolio which management considers “workforce” housing. In the\nfourth quarter of 2023, an increasing trend in substandard loans was reflected in an increase in the risk level for the REBL ACL economic qualitative factor,\nwhich resulted in a $1.0 million increase in the fourth quarter provision for credit loss on loans. At September 30, 2024, real estate\n65\nbridge loans classified as special mention and substandard respectively amounted to $84.4 million and $155.4 million compared to $96.0 million and $80.4\nmillion at June 30, 2024. Each classified loan was evaluated for a potential increase in the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on the basis of the\naforementioned third-party appraisals of apartment building collateral. On the basis of “as is” and “as stabilized” LTVs, increases to the allowance were not\nrequired. The current allowance for credit losses for REBL, is primarily based upon historical industry losses for multi-family loans, in the absence of\nsignificant charge-offs within the Company’s REBL portfolio. As a result of increasing amounts of loans classified as special mention and substandard, the\nCompany evaluated potential related sensitivity for REBL in the third quarter. Such evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may\nbe susceptible to change as more information becomes available. As a result, the Company added a new qualitative factor to its ACL with a cumulative after-tax\nimpact of approximately $1.5 million ($2.0 million pre-tax).\nThe economic qualitative factor is based on the estimated impact of economic conditions on the loan pools, as distinguished from the economic factors\nthemselves, for the following reasons. The Company has experienced limited multifamily (apartment building) loan charge-offs, despite stressed economic\nconditions. Accordingly, the ACL for this pool was derived from a qualitative factor based on industry loss information for multifamily housing. The\nCompany’s charge-offs have been miniscule for SBLOC and IBLOC notwithstanding stressed economic periods, and their ACL is accordingly also determined\nby a qualitative factor. Investment advisor loans were first offered in 2020 with limited performance history, during which charge-offs have not been\nexperienced. For investment advisor loans, the nature of the underlying ultimate repayment source was considered, namely the fee-based advisory income\nstreams resulting from investment portfolios under management, and the impact changes in economic conditions would have on those payment streams. The\nqualitative factors used for this and the other portfolios are described below in the description of each portfolio segment. Additionally, the Company’s charge-\noff histories for SBLs, primarily SBA, and leases have not correlated with economic conditions, including trends in unemployment. While specific economic\nfactors did not correlate with actual historical losses, multiple economic factors are considered in the economic qualitative factor. For the non-guaranteed\nportion of SBA loans, leases, real estate bridge lending and investment advisor financing, the Company’s loss forecasting analysis included a review of industry\nstatistics. However, the Company’s own charge-off history and average life estimates, for categories in which the Company has experienced charge-offs, was\nthe primary quantitatively derived element in the forecasts. The qualitative component results from management’s qualitative assessments which consider\ninternal and external inputs.\nThe following table summarizes select asset quality ratios for each of the periods indicated:\nFor the nine mo nths ended For the year ended\nor as of September 30, or as of December 31,\n2024 2023 2023\nRatio of:\nACL to total loans 0.52% 0.46% 0.51%\nACL to non-performing loans(1) 101.70% 153.04% 206.33%\nNon-performing loans to total loans(1) 0.52% 0.30% 0.25%\nNon-performing assets to total assets(1) 1.14% 0.46% 0.39%\nNet charge-offs to average loans 0.07% 0.05% 0.07%\n(1)Includes loans 90 days past due still accruing interest.\nThe ratio of the ACL to total loans increased to 0.52% as of September 30, 2024 from 0.46% at September 30, 2023 as the ACL increased proportionately more\nthan total loans. The $6.9 million increase in the ACL between those dates, reflected approximately $1.7 million of increased reserves on specific distressed\ncredits and approximately $1.0 million which was added in fourth quarter 2023 for the economic qualitative factor for an increasing trend in special mention\nand substandard real estate bridge loans. In the third quarter of 2024, $2.0 million was added as a result of a new real estate bridge loans related to an increase\nin special mention and substandard loans. Additionally, while reserves for SBLOC and IBLOC loans were reduced as a result of lower loan balances, the related\nreserve impact was more than offset by growth in other loan categories with higher ACL allocations. The lower reserve allocations for SBLOC and IBLOC\nreflect their respective marketable securities and cash value of insurance collateral. The ratio of the ACL to non-performing loans decreased to 101.70% at\nSeptember 30, 2024, from 153.04% at September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the increase in non-performing loans which proportionately exceeded the\nincrease in the ACL. As a result of the increase in non-performing loans, the majority of which was a $12.3 million REBL loan, the ratio of non-performing\nloans to total loans also increased to 0.52% at September 30, 2024 from 0.30% at September 30, 2023. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets\nincreased to 1.14% at September 30, 2024 from 0.46% at September 30, 2023, reflecting the increase in non-performing loans, and a $39.4 million loan\ntransferred to OREO in the second quarter of 2024 with a September 30, 2024 balance of $40.3 million. We intend to continue to manage the capital\nimprovements on the underlying apartment complex. As the units become available for lease, the property manager will be tasked with leasing these units at\nmarket rents. The $40.3 million balance compares to a September 2023 third party “as is” appraisal of $47.8 million, or an 84% “as is” LTV, with additional\npotential collateral value as construction progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental rates. The Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement\nfor that apartment property acquired by the Bank through foreclosure. The purchaser has made earnest money deposits of $375,000, with additional required\ndeposits projected to total $500,000 prior to the December 31, 2024 closing deadline. The sales price is expected to cover the Company’s current OREO balance\nplus the forecasted cost of improvements to the property. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property,\n66\nbut if not consummated, earnest money deposits are expected to accrue to the Company. The nonaccrual balances in this table as of September 30, 2024, are\nalso reflected in the substandard loan totals. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.07% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 0.05%\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflected an increase in direct lease financing net charge-offs.\nNet Charge-offs\nNet charge-offs were $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.1 million from net charge-offs of $2.6 million during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Charge-offs in both periods resulted primarily from non-real estate SBL and leasing charge-offs. SBL charge-offs\nresulted primarily from the non-government guaranteed portion of SBA loans.\nThe following tables reflect the relationship of year-to-date average loans outstanding, based upon quarter end averages, and net charge-offs by loan category\n(dollars in thousands):\nSe pte mber 30, 202 4\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor Real estate Consumer\nestate mortgage construction financing IBLOC financing bridge loans fintech Other loans\nCharge-offs $ 431 $ — $ — $ 3,625 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 16\nRecoveries (102) — — (279) — — — — (1)\nNet charge-offs $ 329 $ — $ — $ 3,346 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 15\nAverage loan balance $ 157,629 $ 639,604 $ 27,739 $ 702,852 $ 1,569,727 $ 235,268 $ 2,102,691 $ 140,046 $ 49,995\nRatio of net charge-offs\nduring the period to average\nloans during the period 0.21% — — 0.48% — — — — 0.03%\nSe pte mber 30, 202 3\nSBL\nSBL non-real commercial SBL Direct lease SBLOC / Advisor Real estate Consumer\nestate mortgage construction financing IBLOC financing bridge loans fintech Other loans\nCharge-offs $ 871 $ — $ — $ 2,804 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 3\nRecoveries (446) (75) — (220) — — — — (299)\nNet charge-offs (recoveries)$ 425 $ (75) $ — $ 2,584 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ (296)\nAverage loan balance $ 120,845 $ 518,304 $ 28,264 $ 660,022 $ 1,885,857 $ 187,414 $ 1,808,924 $ — $ 57,218\nRatio of net charge-offs\n(recoveries) during the period\nto average loans during the\nperiod 0.35% (0.01%) — 0.39% — — — — (0.51%)\nWe review charge-offs at least quarterly in loan surveillance meetings which include the chief credit officer, the loan review department and other senior credit\nofficers in a process which includes identifying any trends or other factors impacting portfolio management. In recent periods charge-offs have been primarily\ncomprised of the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans and leases. The charge-offs have resulted from individual borrower or business circumstances as\nopposed to overall trends or other factors.\nNon-accrual Loans, Loans 90 Days Delinquent and Still Accruing, OREO and Modified Loans.\nLoans are considered to be non-performing if they are on a non-accrual basis or they are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. A loan which is\npast due 90 days or more and still accruing interest remains on accrual status only when it is both adequately secured as to principal and interest, and is in the\nprocess of collection. We had $61.7 million of OREO at September 30, 2024 and $16.9 million of OREO at December 31, 2023. The following tables\nsummarize our non-performing loans, OREO, and loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest.\n67\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNon-accrual loans\nSBL non-real estate $ 3,047 $ 1,842\nSBL commercial mortgage 4,898 2,381\nSBL construction 1,585 3,385\nDirect leasing 3,919 3,785\nIBLOC — —\nReal estate bridge loans 12,300 —\nOther loans — 132\nTotal non-accrual loans 25,749 11,525\nLoans past due 90 days or more and still accruing(1) 4,737 1,744\nTotal non-performing loans 30,486 13,269\nOREO(2) 61,739 16,949\nTotal non-performing assets $ 92,225 $ 30,218\n(1) The majority of the increase in Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing resulted from vehicle leases to governmental entities and municipalities, the payments for which are sometimes\nsubject to administrative delays, SBLOC loans secured by marketable securities and IBLOC loans which are secured by the cash value of life insurance.\n(2) In the first quarter of 2024, a $39.4 million apartment building rehabilitation bridge loan was transferred to nonaccrual status. On April 2, 2024, the same loan was transferred from nonaccrual status\nto OREO, and comprised the majority of our OREO at September 30, 2024, with a balance at that date of $40.3 million. We intend to continue to manage the capital improvements on the underlying\napartment complex. As the units become available for lease, the property manager will be tasked with leasing these units at market rents. The $40.3 million balance compares to a September 2023 third\nparty “as is” appraisal of $47.8 million, or an 84% “as is” LTV, with additional potential collateral value as construction progresses, and units are re-leased at stabilized rental rates. The Company\nentered into a purchase and sale agreement for that apartment property acquired by the Bank through foreclosure. The purchaser has made earnest money deposits of $375,000, with additional required\ndeposits projected to total $500,000 prior to the December 31, 2024 closing deadline. The sales price is expected to cover the Company’s current OREO balance plus the forecasted cost of\nimprovements to the property. There can be no assurance that the purchaser will consummate the sale of the property, but if not consummated, earnest money deposits are expected to accrue to the\nCompany. The nonaccrual balances in this table as of September 30, 2024, are also reflected in the substandard loan totals.\n68\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s non-accrual loans and loans past

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, classified\nloans were segregated by year of origination and are shown in “Note 6. Loans” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein.\nPremises and Equipment, Net\nPremises and equipment amounted to $28.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $27.5 million at December 31, 2023.\n72\nOther assets\nOther assets amounted to $157.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $133.1 million at December 31, 2023.\nDeposits\nOur primary source of funding is deposit acquisition. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms, including demand, checking\nand money market accounts, through and with the assistance of affinity groups. The majority of our deposits are generated through prepaid card and debit and\nother payments related deposit accounts. At September 30, 2024, we had total deposits of $6.93 billion compared to $6.68 billion at December 31, 2023, which\nreflected an increase of $244.8 million, or 3.7%. Daily deposit balances are subject to variability, and deposits averaged $7.01 billion in the third quarter of\n2024. Savings and money market balances are a modest percentage of our funding and we have swept such deposits off our balance sheet to other institutions.\nSuch sweeps are utilized to optimize diversity within our funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to total deposits. A\ndiversified group of prepaid and debit card accounts, which have an established history of stability and lower cost than certain other types of funding, comprise\nthe majority of our deposits. Our product mix includes prepaid card accounts for salary, medical spending, commercial, general purpose reloadable, corporate\nand other incentive, gift, government payments and transaction accounts accessed by debit cards. Balances are subject to daily fluctuations, which may\ncomprise a significant component of variances between dates. Our funding is comprised primarily of millions of small transaction-based consumer balances, the\nvast majority of which are FDIC-insured. We have multi-year, contractual relationships with affinity groups which sponsor such accounts and with whom we\nhave had long-term relationships (see Item 1. “Business—Our Strategies” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023). Those\nlong-term relationships comprise the majority of our deposits while we continue to grow and add new client relationships. Of our deposits at September 30,\n2024, the top three affinity groups accounted for approximately $2.95 billion, the next three largest $1.58 billion, and the four subsequent largest $779.9\nmillion. Of our deposits at year-end 2023, the top three affinity groups accounted for approximately $2.33 billion, the next three largest $1.46 billion, and the\nfour subsequent largest $852.1 million. While certain of these relationships may have changed their ranking in the top ten, the affinity groups themselves were\ngenerally identical at both dates, with some movement in the ninth and tenth largest relationships. We believe that payroll, debit, and government-based\naccounts such as child support are comparable to traditional consumer checking accounts. Such balances in the top ten relationships at September 30, 2024\ntotaled $3.25 billion while balances related to consumer and business payment companies, including companies sponsoring incentive payments, amounted to\n$2.06 billion. Such balances in the top ten relationships at year-end 2023, totaled $2.91 billion while balances related to consumer and business payment\ncompanies, including companies sponsoring incentive and gift card payments, amounted to $1.72 billion. We pay interest directly to consumer account holders\nfor an immaterial amount of deposit balances, while the vast majority of interest expense results from fees paid to affinity groups. The vast majority of such\npayments are variable rate and equate to varying contractual percentages tied to the effective federal funds rate, which results from Federal Reserve rate hikes\nand reductions. The effective federal funds rate also reflects a market rate which might be required to replace lower cost deposits, or fund loan growth in excess\nof deposit growth, at least in the short-term. Because underlying balances have generally exhibited stability, so too have trends in the cost of funds. The more\nconsequential impact to cost of funds are market changes and the effective federal funds rate, specifically the impact of Federal Reserve rate hikes and\nreductions. We model significant fee-based relationships in our net interest income sensitivity modeling (see “Item 2 – Asset and Liability Management”\nabove). The following discussion is applicable to our transaction accounts, comprising the majority of our deposits, in the 100 and 200 basis point rate increase\nand decrease scenarios as presented in the applicable table in that Asset and Liability Management section, above. The impact of the Federal Reserve rate hikes\nor reductions, which respectively increase or decrease interest expense, has approximated the ratio of our cost of funds divided by the effective federal funds\nrate, all else equal. However, there can be no assurance that such ratios could not change significantly given the other variables discussed in the Asset and\nLiability Management section. In third quarter 2024, our demand and interest checking balances averaged $6.94 billion, compared to $6.23 billion in third\nquarter 2023. The growth primarily reflected increases in payment company balances. Average savings and money market balances increased to $65.1 million\nthe third quarter of 2024, compared to $56.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. We sweep deposits off our balance sheet to other institutions to optimize\ndiversity within our funding structure by managing the percentage of individual client deposits to total deposits. Short-term time deposits have been used\nminimally to provide liquidity cushions, for instance when short-term loan origination exceeds short-term deposit growth, as was the case in 2022. In 2023, we\ndid not use short-term time deposits after the first quarter of the year. Short-term time deposits are generated through established intermediaries such as banks\nand other financial companies. These deposits generally originate with investment or trust companies or banks, which offer those deposits at market rates to\nFDIC-insured institutions, such that the balances are fully FDIC-insured. These deposits are generally classified as brokered. While affinity groups may decide\nto pay interest or other remuneration to account holders, they do not currently do so for the vast majority of balances.

The remaining balance for each period reflects\namounts subject to fees paid to third parties, which are based upon a contractual percentage applied to a rate index, generally the effective federal funds rate, and therefore classified as interest expense.\nShort-term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings consist of amounts borrowed on our lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank or FHLB. There were $135.0 million of borrowings\nwith FHLB at September 30, 2024. There were no borrowings on either line at December 31, 2023. We generally utilize overnight borrowings to manage our\ndaily reserve requirements at the Federal Reserve. Period-end and year-to-date information for the dates shown is as follows.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nShort-term borrowings\nBalance at period end $ 135,000 $ —\nAverage for the three months ended September 30, 2024 73,480 N/A\nAverage during the year 55,820 5,739\nMaximum month-end balance 455,000 450,000\nWeighted average rate during the period 5.60% 4.72%\nRate at period end 5.16% —\nSenior Debt\nOn August 13, 2020, we issued $100.0 million of the 2025 Senior Notes, with a maturity date of August 15, 2025, and a 4.75% interest rate, with interest paid\nsemi-annually on March 15 and September 15. The 2025 Senior Notes are the Company’s direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equal in\npriority with all our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all our existing and future subordinated\nindebtedness. In lieu of repayment of debt from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company, industry practice includes the issuance of new debt to repay\nmaturing debt.\nBorrowings\nAt September 30, 2024, we had other long-term borrowings of $38.2 million compared to $38.6 million at December 31, 2023. The borrowings consisted of\nsold loans which were accounted for as a secured borrowing because they did not qualify for true sale accounting. We do not have any policy prohibiting us\nfrom incurring debt.\nThe 2038 Debentures, which total $13.4 million, mature in March 2038 and bear interest at SOFR plus 3.51%, are grandfathered to qualify as tier 1 capital at\nthe Bank.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities amounted to $70.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $69.6 million at December 31, 2023.\nShareholders’ Equity\nAs a means of returning capital to shareholders, the Company implemented stock repurchase programs which totaled $40.0 million, $60.0 million and $100.0\nmillion, in equal quarterly amounts, respectively, in 2021, 2022 and 2023, with $200 million originally planned for 2024. Subsequently, the second quarter 2024\nplanned repurchase was increased from $50 million to $100 million, with $50 million in repurchases planned for each remaining quarter of 2024. The planned\namounts of such repurchases are generally determined in the fourth quarter of the preceding year by assessing the impact of budgetary earnings projections on\nregulatory capital\n74\nrequirements. The excess of projected earnings over amounts required to maintain capital requirements is the maximum available for capital return to\nshareholders, barring any need to retain capital for other purposes. A significant portion of such excess earnings has been utilized for stock repurchases in the\namounts noted above, while cash dividends have not been paid. In determining whether capital is returned through stock repurchases or cash dividends, the\nCompany calculates a maximum share repurchase price, based upon comparisons with what it concludes to be other exemplar peer share price valuations, with\nfurther consideration of internal growth projections. As these share prices, which are updated at least annually, have not been reached, capital return has\nconsisted solely of stock repurchases. Exemplar share price comparisons are based upon multiples of earnings per share over time, with further consideration of\nreturns on equity and assets. While repurchase amounts are planned in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, repurchases may be modified or terminated at\nany time, should capital need to be conserved.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nThere were no off-balance sheet arrangements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future\neffect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources\nthat is material to our interests.\n75\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInformation about market risk for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is included under “Asset and Liability Management” in Part I, Item 2. “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except for such information, there has been\nno material change to our assessment of our sensitivity to market risk as discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nAs noted under “Asset and Liability Management” in Part I, Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk is managed through the use of guidelines which limit interest rate exposure\nto higher interest rates. Because the Company has emphasized variable rate instruments in its loan and investment portfolios, it tends to benefit from higher\ninterest rate environments. As a result of the Federal Reserve rate increases in 2022 and 2023, net interest income has increased and exceeded prior period\nlevels. While future Federal Reserve rate reductions may result in lower net interest income, such exposure to lower rates was significantly reduced in the third\nquarter of 2024 with the purchase of fixed rate securities. In the third quarter of 2024 the Federal Reserve began lowering rates. In addition to the\naforementioned guidelines which the Company uses to manage interest rate risk, the Company utilizes an asset liability committee to provide oversight by\nmultiple departments and senior officers.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified\nin the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our\nprincipal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not\nabsolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.\nUnder the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter\nended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n76\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.
