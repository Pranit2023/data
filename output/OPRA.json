Plac Teatralny 8, 50-051 Wroclaw, Poland).\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Opera Limited\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1441977/Opera_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1441977/Opera_Logo.html)\n\nThe agenda for this year's AGM is:\n\n  * A proposal of share consolidation of the Company's ordinary shares at a ratio of consolidating each two ordinary shares into one ordinary share of the Company (the \"**Share Consolidation** \"), to simplify our share structure as further described below, will be submitted to Opera's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the AGM. \n  * To transact such other business as may properly come before the 2024 AGM of Shareholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof.\n\n\n\nThe Company's American depositary shares (\"**ADSs** \") that trade on Nasdaq each represent two (2) underlying ordinary shares in the Company. There are no other share classes in the Company – only ordinary shares. The Company has observed some confusion as it relates to ordinary shares versus ADSs, both in terms of ownership percentages, and earnings per share versus earnings per ADS. To simplify, we propose a Share Consolidation to merge each two ordinary shares into one ordinary share, following which the ratio between shares and ADSs can then be changed to be one-to-one (1:1). Subject to the approval of the Share Consolidation at the AGM, Opera's board of directors (the \"**Board** \") has approved a change in the ADS ratio proportionate to the Share Consolidation, from one (1) ADS representing two (2) ordinary shares to become one (1) ADS representing one (1) ordinary share (the \"**ADS Ratio Change** \"), to take effect on December 6, 2024 (the \"**Effective Date** \"). Holders of ADSs need not take any action in regard to the ADS Ratio Change.\n\nThe Share Consolidation and ADS Ratio Change collectively will not affect the number of ADSs outstanding or any investor's ownership percentage in the Company. As such, the effect of these changes on the value of each ADS in the Company, as traded on Nasdaq, is neutral. These changes are also neutral for Opera's pre-IPO majority investor. By simplifying our share structure, we will make it easier for our investors to analyze and understand metrics based on the number of shares outstanding.\n\nThe Board has fixed the close of business on November 1, 2024 (Eastern Daylight Time) as the record date (the \"**Record Date** \") for determining the shareholders entitled to receive notice of, and to attend, the AGM or any adjourned or postponed meeting thereof. Holders of record of the Company's ordinary shares, at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the AGM or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Holders of the Company's ADSs who wish to exercise their voting rights for the underlying ordinary shares must act through the depositary of the Company's ADS program, The Bank of New York Mellon. The notice of the AGM, which sets forth the resolutions to be submitted to shareholder approval at the meeting, is available on the Company's website at [_investor.opera.com_](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4294550-1&h=773570721&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.opera.com%2F&a=investor.opera.com). The proposed Share Consolidation is subject to a simple majority vote.\n\nShareholders and ADS holders may obtain a copy of the Company's annual report on Form 20-F, free of charge, from the Company's website at [ _investor.opera.com/sec-filings_](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4294550-1&h=988536905&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.opera.com%2Fsec-filings&a=investor.opera.com%2Fsec-filings).\n\n**_About Opera_**\n\nOpera is a user-centric and innovative software company focused on enabling the best possible internet browsing experience across all devices.

As part of this partnership, Spotify becomes the default streaming service within the upgraded Music Player in Opera's flagship browser, Opera One. Opera users* are also getting the chance to try out Spotify Premium for free for a limited time, unlocking ad-free music, the ability to download playlists and albums to listen offline, higher quality audio, and more.\n\n[ ![Opera and Spotify partnership](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2561755/Opera_x_Spotify.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2561755/Opera_x_Spotify.html)\n\n\"People love listening to music and podcasts while at their computers. Now, with Spotify in the sidebar of Opera One, everything's right there at your fingertips – you can shop, write, plan a trip, all while never having to stop listening to your favorite music and audio via the browser's floating multimedia player,\" said Joanna Czajka, Product Director at Opera.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by Opera, 66% of respondents stream music on their phones even when they are at their desktop computers, with 89% explaining that it helps keep their music at hand without having to switch tabs and apps or look up websites. When asked what integrating a music player into their desktop browser would give them, 66% replied that they wouldn't get distracted with all the jumping around, and that they could then easily control their music while doing other things. Together, Opera and Spotify are addressing this need.\n\nThe new music player with Spotify as the default streaming service is located in the sidebar of the Opera One browser. When activated, it can be detached and moved around the screen without interrupting a user's browsing flow. So instead of having to frequently switch between what they're working on and which song to queue, the solution is floating inside the browser window with Opera's Music Player. The feature also caters to users who often join meetings or calls: the audio playing inside the browser automatically fades out, pauses for the duration of the call, and resumes thereafter.\n\nIn addition to Spotify becoming the default music player in the sidebar of Opera One, users in selected countries worldwide are getting a chance to benefit from several months of Spotify Premium for free, if they are not subscribers already*. The specifics of the offer vary by country. Presently available just within Opera One, the promotion will be expanded to Opera for Android in early 2025.\n\n**Opera One R2**\n\nReleased last month as _[Opera One R2](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4306704-1&h=3499392060&u=https%3A%2F%2Fpress.opera.com%2F2024%2F10%2F23%2Fopera-one-r2-the-best-opera-browser-yet%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpress_release%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dspotify_opera&a=Opera+One+R2)_ , the upgraded desktop flagship is Opera's most powerful and best-looking browser to date. In addition to the new Music Player, Opera One R2 introduces a host of new features that offer further options for personalization, improved tab management, and the latest AI innovations.\n\nSo, see why Opera's flagship desktop browser is the best for music lovers – _[download Opera](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4306704-1&h=444135038&u=https%3A%2F%2Fopr.as%2Fbrowser&a=download+Opera)_ today!\n\n*Opera users in selected countries will be offered an opportunity to upgrade to Spotify Premium and enjoy 2-3 months for free; those countries are: Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Vietnam. This offer is available in the Music Player from the Opera One R2 sidebar.\n\n**About Opera**\n\nOpera is a user-centric and innovative software company focused on enabling the best possible internet browsing experience across all devices.

Since its inception in 2019, Opera GX has quickly become the browser of choice for millions of gamers seeking a more custom internet experience. Along with countless customization options including color themes, sound effects, background music, and a gaming-inspired design, GX includes CPU, RAM and Network Bandwidth limiters that make the browser less resource-hungry and leave more of the computer's resources for gaming. The browser also includes a Hot Tabs Killer feature, which lets users kill the most resource-draining tabs, and GX Cleaner to purge those old unwanted files.\n\n[ ![Opera GX logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2563121/Opera_GX___Horizontal___Positive_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2563121/Opera_GX___Horizontal___Positive_Logo.html)\n\n[ ![The browser for gamers Opera GX releases its largest update since launch in 2019](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2563122/Headline_image_1.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2563122/Headline_image_1.html)\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=LA61999&sd=2024-11-20) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/make-every-pixel-personal-opera-gx-facelift-lets-you-match-your-browser-to-your-setup-down-to-the-smallest-detail-302311763.html>\n\nSOURCE Opera Limited\n\n[](# \"Back to top\")\n\n  * [ ](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.opera.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fmake-every-pixel-personal-opera-gx-facelift-lets-you-match-your&t=Opera Limited - Make every pixel personal: Opera GX facelift lets you match your browser to your setup down to the smallest detail \"Opera - Facebook\")\n  * [ ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=Opera Limited - Make every pixel personal: Opera GX facelift lets you match your browser to your setup down to the smallest detail+https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.opera.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fmake-every-pixel-personal-opera-gx-facelift-lets-you-match-your \"Opera - Twitter\")\n  * [ ](https://www.youtube.com/opera \"Opera - Youtube\")\n  * [ ](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.opera.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fmake-every-pixel-personal-opera-gx-facelift-lets-you-match-your&title=Opera Limited - Make every pixel personal: Opera GX facelift lets you match your browser to your setup down to the smallest detail \"Opera - LinkedIn\")\n  * [ ](https://www.instagram.com/opera/ \"Opera - Instagram\")\n\n\n\n#### Email Alerts\n\nSign up for email alerts\n"
