Overview\n\nThis Governance (the “Code”) of Bridgford Foods Corporation (referred to herein as “Bridgford” or the “Company”) sets forth the guiding principles by which we operate the Company and conduct our daily business with our stockholders, customers, and with each other. These principles apply to all of the Company’s directors, officers and employees. This Code complies with requirements for a “code of ethics” under Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder.\n\n## II. Principles\n\n### A. Compliance and Reporting\n\nEmployees and directors should strive to identify and raise potential issues before they lead to problems, and should ask about the application of this Code whenever in doubt. Any employee or director who becomes aware of any existing or potential violation of this Code should promptly notify Pott’s & Associates (designated as the “Appropriate Ethics Contacts”). The Company will take such disciplinary or preventive action, as it deems appropriate to address any existing or potential violation of this Code brought to its attention. Any questions relating to how these policies should be interpreted or applied should be addressed to an Appropriate Ethics Contact.\n\n### B. Personal Conflicts of Interest\n\nA “personal conflict of interest” occurs when an individual’s private interest improperly interferes with the interests of the Company. Personal conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of policy, unless they have been approved by the Company. In particular, an employee or director must never use or attempt to use his or her position at the Company to obtain any improper personal benefit for himself or herself, for his or her family members, or for any other person, including loans or guarantees of obligations, from any person or entity. Service to the Company should never be subordinated to personal gain and advantage. Conflicts of interest should, to the extent possible, be avoided. Any employee or director who is aware of a material transaction or relationship that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest should discuss the matter promptly with an Appropriate Ethics Contact.\n\n### C. Corporate Opportunities\n\nEmployees and directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate business interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Employees and directors are prohibited from taking for themselves (or directing to a third party) a business opportunity that is discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position, unless the Company has already been offered the opportunity and turned it down. More generally, employees and directors are prohibited from using corporate property, information or position for personal gain or competing with the Company. Sometimes the line between personal and Company benefits is difficult to draw. The only prudent course of conduct for our employees and directors is to make sure that any use of the Company’s property or services that is not solely for the benefit of the Company is approved beforehand through the Appropriate Ethics Contact.\n\n### D. Confidentiality\n\nIn carrying out the Company’s business, employees and directors often learn confidential or proprietary information about the Company, its clients/customers, prospective clients/customers or other third parties. Employees and directors must maintain the confidentiality of all information so entrusted to them, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Confidential or proprietary information includes, among other things, any non-public information concerning the Company, including its businesses, financial performance, results or prospects, product specifications or trade secrets and any non-public information provided by a third party with the expectation that the information will be kept confidential and used solely for the business purpose for which it was conveyed.\n\n### E. Public Disclosure\n\nIt is the Company’s policy that the information in its public communications, including SEC filings, to be full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable. All employees and directors who are involved in the company’s disclosure process are responsible for acting in furtherance of this policy. In particular, these individuals are required to maintain familiarity with the disclosure requirements applicable to the Company and are prohibited from knowingly misrepresenting, omitting, or causing others to misrepresent or omit, material facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside the Company, including the Company’s independent auditors. In addition, any employee or director who has a supervisory role in the Company’s disclosure process has an obligation to discharge his or her responsibilities diligently.\n\n### F. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\n\nIt is the Company’s policy to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. It is the personal responsibility of each employee and director to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations. Generally, it is both illegal and against the Company’s policy for any employee or director who is aware of material nonpublic information relating to the Company, any of the Company’s clients or any other private or governmental issuer of securities to buy or sell any securities of those issuers, or recommend that another person buy, sell or hold the securities of those issuers. Any employee or director who is uncertain about the legal rules involving his or her purchase or sale of any of the Company’s securities or any securities in issuers that he or she is familiar with by virtue of his or her work for the Company should consult with an Appropriate Ethics Contact before making any such purchase or sale.\n\n### G. Fair Dealing\n\nWe do not seek competitive advantages through illegal or unethical business practices. Each employee and director should endeavor to deal fairly with the Company’s clients, service providers, suppliers, competitors and employees. No employee or director should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any unfair dealing practice.\n\n### H. Equal Employment Opportunity and Harassment\n\nOur focus in personnel decisions is on merit and contribution to the Company’s success. Concern for the personal dignity and individual worth of every person is an indispensable element in the standard of conduct that we have set for ourselves. The Company affords equal employment opportunity to all qualified persons without regard to any impermissible criterion or circumstance. This means equal opportunity in regard to each individual’s terms and conditions of employment and in regard to any other matter that affects in any way the working environment of the employee. We do not tolerate or condone any type of discrimination prohibited by law, including harassment.\n\n### I. Protection and Proper Use of the Company’s Assets\n\nAll employees should protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use. All of the Company’s assets should be used for legitimate business purposes only.\n\n## III. Reporting Illegal or Unethical Behavior\n\n### Reporting Illegal or Unethical Behavior\n\nEmployees, officers and directors who suspect or know of violations of this Code or illegal or unethical business or workplace conduct by employees, officers or directors have an obligation to contact either their supervisor or superiors. If the individuals to whom such information is conveyed are not responsive, or if there is reason to believe that reporting to such individuals is inappropriate in particular cases, then the employee, officer or director may contact Pott’s & Associates. Such communications will be kept confidential to the extent feasible. If the employee is still not satisfied with the response, the employee may contact the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Audit Committee”). If concerns or complaints require confidentiality, then this confidentiality will be protected to the extent feasible, subject to applicable law.\n\n### Accounting Complaints\n\nBridgford’s policy is to comply with all applicable financial reporting and accounting regulations. If any director, officer or employee of the Company has unresolved concerns or complaints regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters of the Company, then he or she is encouraged to submit those concerns or complaints (anonymously, confidentially or otherwise) to the Audit Committee. Subject to its legal duties, the Audit Committee and the Board will treat such submissions confidentially. Such submissions may be directed to the attention of the Audit Committee, or any director who is a member of the Audit Committee, at the principal executive offices of Bridgford.\n\n### Non-Retaliation\n\nBridgford prohibits retaliation of any kind against individuals who have made good faith reports or complaints of violations of this Code or other known or suspected illegal or unethical conduct.\n\n## IV. Amendment, Modification and Waiver\n\nThis Code may be amended or modified by the Board of Directors of Bridgford. Waivers of this Code may only be granted on the recommendation of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board with specific delegated authority. Waivers will be disclosed to stockholders as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder and the applicable rules of the Nasdaq National Market.\n\n[Download](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CodeConductBridgfordFoods.pdf) a copy of Governance in PDF format.

Bridgford (1908-1992) opened a retail meat market in San Diego, California. Our business first evolved into several retail meat markets, and later to meat wholesaling, frozen food distribution, meat processing and frozen food manufacturing. The Company is now headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Company has five production facilities: two in Dallas, and one each in Anaheim, California, Chicago, Illinois, and Statesville, North Carolina.\n\n![](https://www.bridgford.com/bread/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bridgford-FirstStore.jpg)**Bridgford Foods** pioneered the manufacture and sale of frozen bread dough to supermarkets and institutional customers, beginning in 1962. The first products were made at the Anaheim meat-processing facility. Additional frozen bread plants were added in Dallas in 1968 and 1985, and in Statesville, North Carolina in 1996. In 1975, we acquired our Chicago meat processing facility, which has a heavy emphasis on dry and semi-dry sausage, as well as beef jerky. In 2017, we acquired an additional processing plant in Chicago, and we completed the transition to this new facility in late 2020.\n\n![](https://www.bridgford.com/bread/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bridgford-AMI1997Award.jpg)\n\nOur principal product lines include Bridgford Frozen Bread Dough and Buttermilk Biscuits, Monkey Bread, Beef Jerky, Shelf-Stable Dry and Semi-Dry Sausage, and Shelf-Stable Sandwiches.

The Company’s common stock (9.1 million shares outstanding) is traded on the NASDAQ National Market System under the symbol “BRID.” There are approximately 700 shareholders. Members of the Bridgford family own or control more than 80% of the common stock, and many members of the extended Bridgford family hold key management positions in the Company.

2022 Annual Report\n\nOur 2022 fiscal year was another year of growth for our company.

For the third consecutive year, sales during the fiscal year reached a record level and were up 10.6% over the prior year at $265,898,000. The Company reported an overall pre-tax profit of $61,407,000, equal to $6.77 per share, with the majority of the profit resulting from the sale of the Green St. property in Chicago, IL which closed on June 1, 2022.

The challenges we faced during 2014 led us to re-evaluate our operations and make some difficult but important changes, and those adjustments were rewarded with the 4th best year in the Company’s 83-year history. As the year progressed, we benefited from declining costs in many aspects of our business, and those lower costs plus the elimination of operations that had been a drain on our finances in prior years produced great results.\n\n  * [BRID-Annual-Report-FY15.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BRID-Annual-Report-FY15.pdf)\n  * [XBRL ](#xbrl)\n\n[brid-20151030.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20151030.xml) [brid-20151030.xsd](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20151030.xsd) [brid-20151030_cal.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20151030_cal.xml) [brid-20151030_def.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20151030_def.xml) [brid-20151030_lab.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20151030_lab.xml) [brid-20151030_pre.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20151030_pre.xml)\n\n\n\n\n## SEC Reports\n\nForm 10-Q, FY15-Q1:[Bridgford_10Q_1Q15.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bridgford_10Q_1Q15.pdf) | [XBRL ](#xbrl)\n\n[brid-20150123.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123.xml) [brid-20150123.xsd](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123.xsd) [brid-20150123_cal.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123_cal.xml) [brid-20150123_def.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123_def.xml) [brid-20150123_lab.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123_lab.xml) [brid-20150123_pre.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123_pre.xml)\n\nForm 10-Q, FY15-Q2:[bfc_10q_2qtr_20150417.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_10q_2qtr_20150417.pdf) | [XBRL ](#xbrl)\n\n[brid-20150417.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417.xml) [brid-20150417.xsd](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417.xsd) [brid-20150417_cal.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417_cal.xml) [brid-20150417_def.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417_def.xml) [brid-20150417_lab.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417_lab.xml) [brid-20150417_pre.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417_pre.xml)\n\nForm 10-Q, FY15-Q3:[bfc_10q_3qtr_20150710.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_10q_3qtr_20150710.pdf) | [XBRL ](#xbrl)\n\n[brid-20150710.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150710.xml) [brid-20150710.xsd](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150710.xsd) [brid-20150710_cal.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150710_cal.xml) [brid-20150710_def.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150710_def.xml) [brid-20150710_lab.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150710_lab.xml) [brid-20150710_pre.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150710_pre.xml)\n\nForm 10-K, FY15:[Final-10K-FY15-011516.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Final-10K-FY15-011516.pdf)\n\n![](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/icon_ar2014.png)\n\n## 2014 Annual Report\n\n2014 was a year of challenges and change for Bridgford Foods Corporation. Soaring commodity costs severely hampered our profitability, but despite our disappointing financial results we made significant progress in areas that leave us poised for success in the future. We discontinued two poorly performing divisions during the year that were not showing promise of a return to profitability. We achieved remarkable sales gains and price increases in our dry sausage and meat snack division that will enable us to take advantage of the inevitable return of reasonable raw material costs.\n\n  * [BRID-Annual-Report-FY14.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BRID-Annual-Report-FY14.pdf)\n  * [XBRL ](#xbrl)\n\n[brid-20141031.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20141031.xml) [brid-20141031.xsd](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20141031.xsd) [brid-20141031_cal.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20141031_cal.xml) [brid-20141031_lab.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20141031_lab.xml) [brid-20141031_def.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20141031_def.xml) [brid-20141031_pre.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20141031_pre.xml)\n\n\n\n\n## SEC Reports\n\nForm 10-Q, FY15-Q1:[Bridgford_10Q_1Q15.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bridgford_10Q_1Q15.pdf) | [XBRL ](#xbrl)\n\n[brid-20150123.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123.xml) [brid-20150123.xsd](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123.xsd) [brid-20150123_cal.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123_cal.xml) [brid-20150123_def.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123_def.xml) [brid-20150123_lab.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123_lab.xml) [brid-20150123_pre.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150123_pre.xml)\n\nForm 10-Q, FY15-Q2:[bfc_10q_3qtr_20150710.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_10q_3qtr_20150710.pdf) | [XBRL ](#xbrl)\n\n[brid-20150417.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417.xml) [brid-20150417.xsd](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417.xsd) [brid-20150417_cal.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417_cal.xml) [brid-20150417_def.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417_def.xml) [brid-20150417_lab.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417_lab.xml) [brid-20150417_pre.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20150417_pre.xml)\n\nForm 10-Q, FY15-Q3:[FINAL-FORM-10Q-3Q15-BRID.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/FINAL-FORM-10Q-3Q15-BRID.pdf)\n\n![](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/icon_ar2013.png)\n\n## 2013 Annual Report\n\n2013 was a successful year for Bridgford Foods Corporation, as the Company was profitable for the 4th time in the last 5 years.

High costs for grains, meats and petroleum products offset the Company's achievements in the areas of cost-cutting and new product development, resulting in unprofitable results for the year. Sales during our 2011 fiscal year were $118,263,000, an increase of 0.5% from sales of $117,655,000 in 2010. The Company continued to eliminate unprofitable products and operations during the year, and continued a re-organization of portions of its dry sausage and meat snack distribution operations. The Company recorded a net loss of $443,000 in 2011, equal to $.05 per share. A loss of $1,675,000 related to an unsuccessful product line introduction hampered our financial results, as did monetary penalties imposed by OSHA and reductions in the surrender value of life insurance policies.\n\n  * [BRID-Annual-Report-FY11.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BRID-Annual-Report-FY11.pdf)\n  * [XBRL ](#xbrl)\n\n[brid-20111028.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20111028.xml) [brid-20111028.xsd](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20111028.xsd) [brid-20111028_cal.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20111028_cal.xml) [brid-20111028_def.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20111028_def.xml) [brid-20111028_lab.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20111028_lab.xml) [brid-20111028_pre.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20111028_pre.xml)\n\n\n\n\n## SEC Reports\n\nAudit Committee Charter[RDG-BRID-8K-Dividend-FY12.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RDG-BRID-8K-Dividend-FY12.pdf)\n\nForm 8K Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders (03/20/2012)[RDG-BRID-8K-Dividend-FY121.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RDG-BRID-8K-Dividend-FY121.pdf)\n\nForm 4 (09/24/2012)[Bridgford-Form-4-9-25-12.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bridgford-Form-4-9-25-12.pdf)\n\nForm 4 (11/12/2012)[Form-4-HWB-111212-Edgarized.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Form-4-HWB-111212-Edgarized.pdf)\n\nForm 8K Dividend Declaration (11/12/2012)[RDG-brid20120320_8k_proof.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RDG-brid20120320_8k_proof.pdf)\n\nForm 10-Q, FY12-Q1:[brid_10q-0120121.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid_10q-0120121.pdf) | [XBRL ](#xbrl)\n\n[brid-20120120.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120120.xml) [brid-20120120.xsd](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120120.xsd) [brid-20120120_cal.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120120_cal.xml) [brid-20120120_def.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120120_def.xml) [brid-20120120_lab.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120120_lab.xml) [brid-20120120_pre.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120120_pre.xml)\n\nForm 10-Q, FY12-Q2:[bfc_form10qfy12qtr21.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_form10qfy12qtr21.pdf) | [XBRL ](#xbrl)\n\n[brid-20120413.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120413.xml) [brid-20120413.xsd](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120413.xsd) [brid-20120413_cal.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120413_cal.xml) [brid-20120413_def.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120413_def.xml) [brid-20120413_lab.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120413_lab.xml) [brid-20120413_pre.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120413_pre.xml)\n\nForm 10-Q, FY12-Q3:[bfc_10q-0706121.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_10q-0706121.pdf) | [XBRL ](#xbrl)\n\n[brid-20120706.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120706.xml) [brid-20120706.xsd](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120706.xsd) [brid-20120706_cal.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120706_cal.xml) [brid-20120706_def.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120706_def.xml) [brid-20120706_lab.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120706_lab.xml) [brid-20120706_pre.xml](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brid-20120706_pre.xml)\n\n![](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/icon_ar2010.png)\n\n## 2010 Annual Reports\n\nDespite dramatic increases in the costs of key commodities, Bridgford Foods Corporation again achieved solid profitability in the 2010 fiscal year.

Higher raw materials costs and strong competition in both the meat and bakery segments of our business reduced our gross operating margins. Higher workmen's compensation insurance costs, employee pension and medical charges, in addition to higher fuel and utility costs, added to our overall expense increases.\n\n  * [bfc_ar2003.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_ar2003.pdf)\n\n\n\n## SEC Reports\n\nForm 10-Q, FY04-Q1:[bfc_form10qfy05q12.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_form10qfy05q12.pdf)\n\nForm 10-Q, FY04-Q2:[bfc_form10qfy04q2.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_form10qfy04q2.pdf)\n\nForm 10-Q, FY04-Q3:[bfc_form10qfy04q3.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_form10qfy04q3.pdf)\n\n![](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/icon_ar2002.png)\n\n## 2002 Annual Report\n\n2002 was a difficult year for Bridgford Foods. The bankruptcy of a major customer, higher pension costs, higher bakery commodity costs and extreme price competition, as well as a soft economy, all contributed to lower sales and earnings. Also, the implementation of our new computer system resulted in approximately $685,000 in non-recurring expenses during fiscal year 2002.\n\n  * [BRID-Annual-Report-FY02.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BRID-Annual-Report-FY02.pdf)\n\n\n\n## SEC Reports\n\nForm 10-Q, FY03-Q1:[bfc_form10qfy03q1.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_form10qfy03q1.pdf)\n\nForm 10-Q, FY03-Q2:[bfc_form10qfy03q2.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_form10qfy03q2.pdf)\n\nForm 10-Q, FY03-Q3:[bfc_form10qfy03q3.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_form10qfy03q3.pdf)\n\nForm 3[bfc_form340515.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bfc_form340515.pdf)\n\n## 2001 Annual Report\n\n2001 was a challenging year for Bridgford Foods. Our business was adversely affected by the recession and the tragic events of September 11. Sales reached a record level in 2001, but profits were down substantially compared to the prior year. Meat raw materials, energy and fuel costs were higher than anticipated for most of fiscal 2001, while competition was especially strong in the food service area and the meat snack business.\n\n  * [2001.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2001/07/2001.pdf)\n\n\n\n## 2000 Annual Report\n\nThe year 2000 was a good year for Bridgford Foods. Sales reached an all-time record level while profits were the second best in Company history. Lower profits were due to higher costs for raw materials, energy, transportation, petroleum based packaging materials and employee health care. New product and new customer development also contributed to increased expenses.\n\n  * [2000.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/2000/07/2000.pdf)\n\n\n\n## 1999 Annual Report\n\nIt is a great pleasure to report that 1999 was a banner year for Bridgford Foods Corporation. New all-time record highs were attained in sales, earnings, dividends and capital. Net profits exceeded ten million dollars for the first time in our sixty-seven year history.\n\n  * [1999.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/1999/07/1999.pdf)\n\n\n\n## 1998 Annual Report\n\n1998 was an outstanding year for Bridgford Foods Corporation. All-time highs were established for sales, earnings and equity. Favorable commodity costs, manufacturing efficiencies, tight cost controls and strong marketing programs all contributed to the greatest one year success in company history.\n\n  * [1998.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/1998.pdf)\n\n\n\n## 1997 Annual Report\n\nBridgford Foods Corporation's sales and earnings set new records in our 1997 fiscal year, the fifty-two weeks ended October 31, 1997. New efficiencies and increased productivity resulting from our capital expenditures for plant and equipment in 1995 and 1996 enabled us to earn $6.6 million in 1997, an all-time high.\n\n  * [1997.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/1997/07/1997.pdf)\n\n\n\n## 1996 Annual Report\n\nSales set a new record for the eleventh consecutive year in 1996. Dividends were increased for the tenth year in a row. Three major capital improvement projects begun in our 1995 fiscal year, including the two largest in the Company's 64 year history, were completed with a total capitalized cost of $12,000,000. Net income for 1996 was $5.7 million, which reflects a decrease from 1995 due to extremely high raw material costs in both our meat and bakery divisions.\n\n  * [1996.pdf](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/uploads/1996/07/1996.pdf)\n\n\n\n![Join Our Newsletter](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/themes/bridgford/library/img/join-our-newsletter.png)\n\nYes, I want promotions and more.\n\n![Get Social](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/themes/bridgford/library/img/get-social.png)\n\nFollow the Bridgford Familyon your favorite network.\n\n[![Facebook](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/themes/bridgford/library/img/social/facebook.png)](https://www.facebook.com/BridgfordFoods) [![X](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/themes/bridgford/library/img/social/x.png)](https://twitter.com/BridgfordFoods) [![Instagram](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/themes/bridgford/library/img/social/instagram.png)](https://instagram.com/bridgfordfoods/?ref=badge) [![Pinterest](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/themes/bridgford/library/img/social/pinterest.png)](https://www.pinterest.com/bridgfordfoods/) [![YouTube](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/wp-content/themes/bridgford/library/img/social/youtube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bridgfordfoods)\n\n© 2024 Bridgford Foods Corporation - [About](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/about/) - [Investors](http://www.bridgford.com/corporate/investors/) - [Employees](https://outlook.office.com/bridgford.com) - [Governance](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/governance/) - [Contact](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/contact/) - [Site Map](https://www.bridgford.com/corporate/site-map/) - Toll-Free 1-800-527-2105\n"
