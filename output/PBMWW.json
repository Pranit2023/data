(“**Psyence Group** “) (CSE: PSYG) today announced the successful closing of its previously announced disposal of its 11.13% stake in privately held PsyLabs to its NASDAQ-listed associate, Psyence Biomedical Ltd (NASDAQ: PBM) (“PBM” or “Psyence Biomed”) (“Disposal”). Per the terms of the Disposal, Psyence Biomed will issue to Psyence Group 2,000,000 shares of its common stock. PsyLabs is focused on the cultivation and production of psychedelic active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and extracts for use in research, clinical trials and drug development. As previously announced, Psyence Biomed and PsyLabs have an existing strategic partnership whereby PsyLabs has granted Psyence Biomed a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing IP licensing agreement to supply pharmaceutical-grade, EU GMP nature-derived (non-synthetic) psilocybin to be evaluated in future clinical trials as a potential treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and other Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) and for commercialization of the licensed product.\n\nAccording to a new release issued by Psyence Biomed, Dr. Neil Maresky, Chief Executive Officer of Psyence Biomed said, “We are very pleased to have acquired a direct interest in PsyLabs through this acquisition and intend to capitalize on the benefits of being one of the world’s few vertically integrated developers of psychedelic-based regulatory-approved therapeutics.”\n\n### Debt-for-Equity Swap Agreement\n\nPsyence Group and Psyence Biomed have entered into a debt-for-equity swap agreement (the “**Debt Swap Agreement** “), pursuant to which Psyence Biomed has agreed to issue 845,394 Psyence Biomed common shares at a deemed price of US$0.50 per common share to Psyence Group, in exchange for the discharging of the balance of the debt repayment obligation due under a promissory note, dated January 25, 2024, issued by Psyence Biomed to Psyence Group in connection with Psyence Biomed’s listing of its common shares on the NASDAQ in January 2024 (“**Debt Swap** “). In the event that the average VWAP of Psyence Biomed common shares for the ten trading days prior to January 15, 2025 is lower than US$0.50, Psyence Biomed will be required to make a “make whole payment” in cash or common shares, as set forth in the Debt Swap Agreement. Psyence Biomed has agreed to register the resale of the common shares within 60 days of the issuing of such common shares.\n\nThe Debt Swap Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. Psyence Group’s board of directors has, subject to the appropriate recusal of interested directors who are also directors of Psyence Biomed, approved the Debt Swap Agreement and no materially contrary view or abstention was expressed or made by any director in relation to the Debt Swap. Psyence Group will not file a material change report in respect of the Debt Swap at least 21 days before anticipated closing of the Debt Swap, as Psyence Group wishes to close on an expedited basis for sound business reasons.\n\n### **About PsyLabs:**\n\n[PsyLabs](https://psylabs.life/) is a psychedelic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) development company that is federally licensed to cultivate and export psilocybin mushrooms and other psychedelic compounds, including psilocin, mescaline, ibogaine and dimethyltryptamine (DMT) to the legal medical and research markets.

In the event that the average VWAP of Psyence Biomed common shares for the ten trading days prior to January 15, 2025 is lower than US$0.50, Psyence Biomed will be required to make a “make whole payment” in cash or common shares, as set forth in the Debt Swap Agreement. Psyence Biomed has agreed to register the resale of the common shares within 60 days of the issuing of such common shares.\n\n“The Debt Swap allows the Company to improve its overall portfolio flexibility by acquiring readily tradable securities and enhancing liquidity. The acquisition of the publicly traded shares of PBM provides greater transparency and market valuation, helping to establish a clearer assessment of the investment’s worth.” said Jody Aufrichtig, Executive Chairman of the Company.\n\nThe Debt Swap Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. The Debt Swap will be a “related party transaction” pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”). The Company is relying on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 pursuant to sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a), respectively, on the basis that at the time the Debt Swap was agreed to, neither the fair market value of the loan amount discharged by the Company, nor the consideration to be received for by the Company for such discharge, exceeds 25% of the Company’s market capitalization. The Company’s board of directors has, subject to the appropriate recusal of interested directors who are also directors of Psyence Biomed, approved the Debt Swap Agreement and no materially contrary view or abstention was expressed or made by any director in relation to the Debt Swap. The Company will not file a material change report in respect of the Debt Swap at least 21 days before anticipated closing of the Debt Swap, as the Company wishes to close on an expedited basis for sound business reasons.\n\n### About Psyence Group and Psyence Biomed:\n\nPsyence Group is a life science biotechnology company listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE: PSYG), with a focus on natural psychedelics.

Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results, our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions with respect to future operations, products and services; and other statements identified by words such as “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “outlook” or words of similar meaning._\n\n_Forward-looking statements in this communication include statements regarding the safety and effectiveness of psilocybin as a treatment option for adjustment disorder within the context of Palliative Care. These forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions, including the assumption that the trial site initiation and patient recruitment will be successful in accordance with the expected timelines, and that trial results will support the initiation of Phase III registrational trials._\n\n_There are numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among others: (i) the ability of Psyence Biomed’s contract research partner, iNGENū, to execute its obligations in respect of the clinical trial; (ii) changes in applicable laws which may impact the clinical trial and/or the conducting thereof; (iii) Psyence Biomed’s subsidiary, Psyence Australia’s, ability to achieve successful clinical results; (iv) Psyence Biomed’s ability to obtain regulatory approval for its product candidates, and any related restrictions or limitations of any approved products; (v) Psyence Biomed’s ability to obtain licensing of third-party intellectual property rights and supply of raw materials for future discovery and development of its product candidates; (vi) the ability of Psyence Biomed to maintain the listing of its common shares and warrants on Nasdaq; and (vii) volatility in the price of the securities of Psyence Biomed due to a variety of factors, including changes in the competitive and highly regulated industries in which Psyence Biomed operates, variations in performance across competitors, changes in laws and regulations affecting Psyence Biomed’s business and changes in Psyence Biomed’s capital structure. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors, and the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of the final prospectus filed by Psyence Biomed with the SEC on August 30, 2024 and other documents filed by Psyence Biomed from time to time with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information. Nothing in this communication should be regarded as a representation by any person that the forward-looking statements set forth herein will be achieved or that any of the contemplated results of such forward-looking statements will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except as required by law, neither Psyence Group, nor Psyence Biomed intends to update these forward-looking statements._\n\n_Neither Psyence Group, nor Psyence Biomed, makes no medical, treatment or health benefit claims about Psyence Biomed’s proposed products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada or other similar regulatory authorities have not evaluated claims regarding psilocybin, psilocybin analogues, or other psychedelic compounds or nutraceutical products. The efficacy of such products has not been confirmed by approved research. There is no assurance that the use of psilocybin, psilocybin analogues, or other psychedelic compounds or nutraceuticals can diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or condition. Vigorous scientific research and clinical trials are needed. Psyence Biomed has not conducted clinical trials for the use of its proposed products. Any references to quality, consistency, efficacy, and safety of potential products do not imply that Psyence Biomed verified such in clinical trials or that Psyence Biomed will complete such trials. If Psyence Biomed cannot obtain the approvals or research necessary to commercialize its business, it may have a material adverse effect on Psyence Biomed’s performance and operations._\n\n[Psyence

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada or other similar regulatory authorities have not evaluated claims regarding psilocybin, psilocybin analogues, or other psychedelic compounds or nutraceutical products. The efficacy of such products has not been confirmed by approved research. There is no assurance that the use of psilocybin, psilocybin analogues, or other psychedelic compounds or nutraceuticals can diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or condition.

(Nasdaq: PBM) (“**Psyence Biomed** ” or “**PBM** “), has issued a corporate update to its shareholders on September 16, 2024. According to the news release issued by Psyence Biomed, the company has achieved critical milestones with respect to its Phase IIb clinical trial which seeks to evaluate nature-derived psilocybin in conjunction with psychotherapy as a potential treatment for Adjustment Disorder in Palliative Care (being initiated in Australia), has strengthen and expanded on its clinical trial strategy, and has strengthen its financial position.\n\nAccording to the news release, following the initiation of patient screening, Psyence Biomed seeks to enroll its Phase IIb study as efficiently as possible, and projects topline data availability towards the end of next year that, if positive, will support the initiation of a pivotal Phase III trial as soon as practicable thereafter. To better support this program, Psyence Biomed has partnered with Optimi Health as an exclusive supplier of GMP nature-derived psilocybin extract for future Phase III trials as well as subsequent commercialization, should negotiations between the parties be successful. The update further announces Psyence Biomed’s planned second development indication, which will evaluate GMP nature-derived psilocybin as a potential treatment for Substance Use Disorders (SUDs), including Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and states that it has entered into an agreement with a third party, private company, Psylabs, to be the exclusive supplier of highly purified psilocybin extract exclusively for these indications.\n\nThe news release goes on to state that Psyence Biomed has signed a conditional, binding term sheet for the proposed acquisition of psilocybin-based drug developer, Clairvoyant Therapeutics, which, if implemented, introduces a synthetic psilocybin-based therapeutic candidate that nicely complements Psyence Biomed’s ongoing nature-derived psilocybin development programs, expands the clinical pipeline into AUD, and (if successful) will transition Psyence Biomed to a commercial-stage, revenue-generating company. Finally, Psyence Biomed reports that it has entered into agreements to secure critical funding required to advance these initiates and that it expects to obtain sufficient capital to execute its strategy.\n\n“Once again, the management team of Psyence Biomed has demonstrated that it is executing on its lead clinical program, advancing its clinical trial endeavors into a second indication and securing the resources required to execute on its overall strategy. We are pleased with the progress being made by Psyence Biomed and look forward to future updates,” said Jody Aufrichtig, Executive Chairman of the Psyence Group.\n\nFor more on the Psyence Biomed corporate and shareholder updates, please refer to the primary news release available [here](https://psyencebiomed.com/psyence-biomed-issues-shareholder-update-recapping-recent-progress-and-previewing-key-upcoming-data-milestones/.)\n\n### About Psyence Group and Psyence Biomed:\n\nPsyence Group is a life science biotechnology company listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE: PSYG), with a focus on natural psychedelics.

Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results, our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions with respect to future operations, products and services; and other statements identified by words such as “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “outlook” or words of similar meaning._\n\n_Forward-looking statements in this communication include statements regarding the safety and effectiveness of psilocybin as a treatment option for adjustment disorder within the context of Palliative Care. These forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions, including the assumption that the trial site initiation and patient recruitment will be successful in accordance with the expected timelines, and that trial results will support the initiation of Phase III registrational trials._\n\n_There are numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among others: (i) the ability of Psyence Biomed’s contract research partner, iNGENū, to execute its obligations in respect of the clinical trial; (ii) changes in applicable laws which may impact the clinical trial and/or the conducting thereof; (iii) Psyence Biomed’s subsidiary, Psyence Australia’s, ability to achieve successful clinical results; (iv) Psyence Biomed’s ability to obtain regulatory approval for its product candidates, and any related restrictions or limitations of any approved products; (v) Psyence Biomed’s ability to obtain licensing of third-party intellectual property rights and supply of raw materials for future discovery and development of its product candidates; (vi) the ability of Psyence Biomed to maintain the listing of its common shares and warrants on Nasdaq; and (vii) volatility in the price of the securities of Psyence Biomed due to a variety of factors, including changes in the competitive and highly regulated industries in which Psyence Biomed operates, variations in performance across competitors, changes in laws and regulations affecting Psyence Biomed’s business and changes in Psyence Biomed’s capital structure. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors, and the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of the final prospectus filed by Psyence Biomed with the SEC on August 30, 2024 and other documents filed by Psyence Biomed from time to time with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information. Nothing in this communication should be regarded as a representation by any person that the forward-looking statements set forth herein will be achieved or that any of the contemplated results of such forward-looking statements will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except as required by law, neither Psyence Group, nor Psyence Biomed intends to update these forward-looking statements._\n\n_Neither Psyence Group, nor Psyence Biomed, makes no medical, treatment or health benefit claims about Psyence Biomed’s proposed products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada or other similar regulatory authorities have not evaluated claims regarding psilocybin, psilocybin analogues, or other psychedelic compounds or nutraceutical products. The efficacy of such products has not been confirmed by approved research. There is no assurance that the use of psilocybin, psilocybin analogues, or other psychedelic compounds or nutraceuticals can diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or condition. Vigorous scientific research and clinical trials are needed. Psyence Biomed has not conducted clinical trials for the use of its proposed products.

The Board subsequently amended the plan\non February 16, 2022, with effect from March 1, 2022 (the \"RSU Plan\"). The RSU Plan is\ndesigned to provide certain directors, officers, consultants and other key employees (collectively,\nan \"Eligible Person\") of the Company and its related entities with the opportunity to acquire\nrestricted share units (\"RSUs\") of the Company. The acquisition of RSUs allows an Eligible\nPerson to participate in the long-term success of the Company thus promoting the alignment of an\nEligible Persons.

All employees, officers, directors, management company employees or\nconsultants (as defined in the RSU Plan) of the Company and its related entities are eligible to\nparticipate in the RSU Plan (as \"Participants\"), and the Company reserves the right to restrict\neligibility or otherwise limit the number of persons eligible for participation as Participants in the\nRSU Plan. Eligibility to participate as a Participant in the RSU Plan does not confer upon any\nperson a right to receive an award of RSUs.\nSubject to certain restrictions, the Board or its appointed Committee (as defined in the RSU Plan)\ncan, from time to time, award RSUs to Eligible Persons. RSUs will be credited to an account\nmaintained for each Participant on the books of the Company as of the award date. The number of\nRSUs to be credited to each Participant's account shall be determined at the discretion of the Board\nand pursuant to the terms of the RSU Plan.\nRolling Plan. The aggregate number of shares that may be reserved for issuance under the RSU\nPlan at any time shall not exceed 7.5% of the Company's outstanding shares. As of the date hereof,\n8,268,138 RSUs (representing 5.9% of the Company's outstanding shares as of the date hereof)\nremain available for grant. This 7.5% limit shall not include the number of shares reserved for\nissuance under any other incentive plans of the Company.\nVesting. The Board or the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine the time during which\nRSUs shall vest (except that no RSU, or portion thereof, may vest after the expiry date) and\nwhether there shall be any other conditions or performance criteria to vesting. In the absence of\nany determination by the Board or the Committee to the contrary, RSUs will vest and be payable\nas to one third (1/3) of the total number of RSUs granted on each of the first, second and third\n- 11 -\nanniversaries of the date or dates on which an award of RSUs is made to a Participant (computed\nin each case to the nearest whole RSU), provided that in all cases payment in satisfaction of a RSU\nshall occur prior to the Outside Payment Date (which, in respect of a RSU, means December 31\nof the calendar year in which the expiry date of the RSUs occurs). Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nthe Committee may, in its sole discretion at any time or in the RSU agreement in respect of any\nRSUs granted, accelerate, or provide for the acceleration of vesting (in whole or in part) of RSUs\npreviously granted. The award value of any RSU shall be determined as of the applicable vesting\ndate.\nTransferability. RSUs and all other rights, benefits or interests in the plan are non-transferable\nand may not be pledged or assigned or encumbered in any way and are not subject to attachment\nor garnishment, except that if a Participant dies the legal representatives of the Participant will be\nentitled to receive the amount of any payment otherwise payable to the Participant hereunder in\naccordance with the provisions of the RSU Plan.\nLimitations. Unless the Company has first obtained disinterested shareholder approval of the plan,\nthe RSU Plan limits the total number of shares issuable at any time to insiders of the Company,\nwhen combined with all other shares issuable to insiders under any security based compensation\narrangement, to 10% of the total number of issued and outstanding equity securities of the\nCompany. Unless the Company has first obtained disinterested shareholder approval of the plan,\nit further limits the total number of shares issuable to insiders during any one year period under\nthe plan, when combined with all other shares issuable to insiders under any security based\ncompensation arrangement, to 10% of the total number of issued and outstanding equity securities\nof the Company.\nNo RSU may be issued to anyone engaged to perform investor relations activities for the Company.\nIn no event can the issuance of RSUs, when combined with any grant made pursuant to any other\nsecurity based compensation arrangement, result in: (i) any one person being granted share-based\ncompensation awards equaling or exceeding 5% of the issued shares, within a 12 month period;\nand (ii) any one consultant in a 12 month period being granted share-based compensation equaling\nor exceeding 2% of the issued shares.\nResignation, Termination, Engagement, Death or Disability. Upon the voluntary resignation\nor the termination for cause of a Participant, all of the Participant's RSUs which remain vested, but\nunexercised or unvested in the Participant's Account shall be forfeited without any entitlement to\nsuch Participant.\nGenerally, if a Participant dies, or their employment or engagement terminates with the Company\ndue to total disability, while employed or retained by the Company, or while an officer or director,\nthe expiry date of any vested or unvested RSUs held by the Participant at the date of death or date\nof termination due to total disability, which have not yet been subject to an exercise notice and\nsubsequent award payout, shall be amended to the earlier of (i) one (1) year after the date of death\nor date of termination due to total disability, and (ii) the expiry date of such award, except that in\nthe event the expiration of the award is earlier than one (1) year after the date of death or date of\ntermination due to total disability, the expiry date shall be up to one (1) year after the date of death\nor date of termination due to total disability as determined by the Board.\n- 12 -\nChange of Control. Subject to any provision to the contrary contained in an RSU agreement or\nother written agreement (such as an agreement of employment) between the Company and a\nParticipant, if a change of control takes place, all issued and outstanding RSUs shall vest (whether\nor not then vested) and the vesting date shall be the date which is immediately prior to the time\nsuch change of control takes place, or at such earlier time as may be established by the Board or\nthe Committee, in its absolute discretion, prior to the time such change of control takes place.\nCredit For Dividends. Within ten (10) days following the declaration and payment of dividends\non the Shares, the Board may determine to make a cash payment to a Participant in respect of\noutstanding RSUs credited to the Participant's Account, which shall be calculated in accordance\nwith the RSU Plan.\nTerms of RSUs. Subject to an earlier expiry date as may be determined by the Board and set out\nin the RSU agreement, RSUs will expire either at the earlier of December 31st of the third calendar\nyear following the year in which the grant date falls for Canadian employee participants or in all\nother cases, the earlier of the tenth anniversary of the date of the RSU grant.\nAdjustments and Reorganizations. In the event of any dividend paid in shares, share subdivision,\ncombination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, spin-off, or other distribution of\nCompany assets to shareholders, or any other change in the capital of the Company affecting\nshares, the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, will make, with respect to the number of\nRSUs outstanding under this Plan, any proportionate adjustments as it considers appropriate to\nreflect that change.\nThe above information is intended to be a brief description of the RSU Plan and is qualified in its\nentirety by the full text of the RSU Plan, a copy of which is attached as Schedule \"D\" to this\nInformation Circular.\nCompensation Securities by Directors and NEOs\nThe compensation securities granted or issued to a director or NEO by the Company or any\nsubsidiary thereof during the financial year ended March 31, 2023, for services provided, or to be\nprovided directly or indirectly, to the Company or any subsidiary thereof is as follows:\nTable of compensation securities\nName and position\nCom Sep ce un rs ita yt ion C S\npS\nu\neo\neUN\ne\nn\nc\nrmnu\nc\nce\nud\ncu\npm\nex\nr\nle\nr\ni\nnee\natb\nir\nnr\ni\ntt\nsl\ne\nae\nci\nsy\nse\nsir\ngai\ns\ns\nn\neo\nate\ng\nio\nf\nnod\no\nf\ndn f\nGrant Date\nE Px rie cr ec i (s $e\n)\nCoN S emu xep em c rueb cn r ie is str ia ee o t dsif o n SC elo cUs u oni rn fd i tg Ge y r rP l o ayr n nii nc tD ge a o tef SC elo cU us ni rn d i etg e y nr P dalyr t i i nc Yge e o af r\nExpiry Date\nJody Aufrichtig (1) RSU’s 370,000 (7%) Sep 2, 2022 0.00 122,100(8) 0.10 0.13 Dec 31, 2025\nDirector & Executive Options 535,000 (14%) Mar 31, 2023 0.14 - 0.13 0.13 Mar 31, 2028\nChairman, former CEO\nRSU’s 1,000,000 (18%) Mar 31, 2023 0.00 - 0.13 0.13 Dec 31, 2026\n- 13 -\nDr. Neil Maresky (2) RSU’s 370,000 (7%) Sep 2, 2022 0.00 122,100(8) 0.10 0.13 Dec 31, 2025\nOptions 535,000 (14%) Mar 31, 2023 0.14 - 0.13 0.13 Mar 31, 2028\nChief Executive Officer\nand Director RSU’s 1,000,000 (18%) Mar 31, 2023 0.00 - 0.13 0.13 Dec 31, 2026\nWarwick Corden- RSU’s 200,000 (4%) Sep 2, 2022 0.00 66,000(8) 0.10 0.13 Dec 31, 2025\nLloyd (3)\nOptions 200,000 (5%) Mar 31, 2023 0.14 - 0.13 0.13 Mar 31, 2028\nChief Financial Officer\nand Company Secretary RSU’s 445,000 (8%) Mar 31, 2023 0.00 - 0.13 0.13 Dec 31, 2026\nDr. Amza Ali (4)\nDirector & Chief Medical - - - - - - - -\nOfficer\nMarvin Singer (5)\n- - - - - - - -\nDirector\nGavin Basserabie (6)\n- - - - - - -\nDirector\nRSU’s 180,000 (3%) Sep 2, 2022 0.00 59,400(8) 0.10 0.13 Dec 31, 2025\nAlan Friedman (7)\nOptions 150,000 (4%) Mar 31, 2023 0.14 - 0.13 0.13 Mar 31, 2028\nDirector\nRSU’s 300,000 (6%) Mar 31, 2023 0.00 - 0.13 0.13 Dec 31, 2026\n1.

The key elements of the executive compensation program are: (i) base salary; (ii)\npotential annual incentive awards; and (iii) incentive securities-based awards. The directors are of\nthe view that all elements of the total program should be considered, rather than any single element.\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for determining all forms of compensation, including long-\nterm incentive in the form of stock options and restricted share units, to be granted to the CEO, or\nsuch person acting in capacity of CEO of the Company, the directors and management, and for\nreviewing the recommendations with respect to compensation of the other officers of the\nCompany, to ensure such arrangements reflect the responsibilities and risks associated with each\nposition.\nThe Board of Directors tasks the Compensation Committee (as hereinafter defined) to periodically\nreview the compensation paid to directors, officers, and management based on such factors as: i)\nrecruiting and retaining executives critical to the success of the Company and the enhancement of\nshareholder value; ii) providing fair and competitive compensation; iii) balancing the interests of\nmanagement and the Company's shareholders; iv) rewarding performance, both on an individual\nbasis and with respect to operations in general; and v) to provide recommendations with respect to\ncompensation matters to the Board of Directors.\nIn general, the Company will provide a specific benefit or perquisite only when it provides\ncompetitive value and promotes retention of executives, or when the perquisite provides\nshareholder value, such as ensuring the health of executives. The limited perquisites the Company\nprovides its executives may include a parking allowance or a fee for each board or committee\nmeeting attended, or to assist with their out-of-pocket costs, and such benefits and perquisites as\nset out, respectively, in the \"Table of compensation excluding compensation securities\" above.\nPension disclosure\nThe Company does not have any pension, defined benefit, defined contribution or deferred\ncompensation plans in place.\n- 19 -\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nNumber of securities to be Weighted-average exercise Number of securities\nissued upon exercise of price of outstanding options, remaining available for future\noutstanding option, warrants warrants and rights issuance under equity\nand rights compensation plans (excluding\nsecurities reflected in column\n(a))\nPlan Category (a) (b) (c)\nEquity compensation plans\napproved by security holders 14,763,514 $0.07 9,580,075\nEquity compensation plans not\napproved by security holders - N/A -\nAUDIT COMMITTEE AND RELATIONSHIP WITH AUDITOR\nNational Instrument 52-110 Audit Committees (\"NI 52-110\") requires the Company, as a venture\nissuer, to disclose annually in its Management Information Circular certain information concerning\nthe constitution of its audit committee and its relationship with its independent auditor, as set forth\nin the following:\nThe Audit Committee's Charter\nThe Audit Committee has a charter (the \"Audit Committee Charter\"), which sets out its mandate\nand responsibilities.

All members are \"financially literate\" as such terms are defined in\nNI 52-110.\nNI 52-110 provides that a member of an audit committee is \"independent\" if the member has no\ndirect or indirect material relationship with the Company, which could, in the view of the Board,\nreasonably interfere with the exercise of the member's independent judgment.

Alan Friedman and Warwick Corden-Lloyd are not executive\nofficers, employees or control persons of the Company.\nThe members of the Audit Committee are elected by the Board at its first meeting following the\nannual shareholder's meeting.

Corporate\ngovernance encourages the adoption of policies to ensure the board of directors recognizes the\nprinciples of good management. The Board is committed to sound corporate governance practices;\nas such practices are both in the interests of shareholders and help to contribute to effective and\nefficient decision-making. The Company has adopted corporate governance policies and\nguidelines (the \"Guidelines\") governing key matters and has according enacted: (1) internal\nguidelines to control transactions involving its securities by all Company directors, officers and\ninsiders (among others) to ensure that such parties are aware of and comply with their legal\nobligations with respect to \"insider trading\" and \"tipping\" and (2) timely disclosure and\nconfidentiality guidelines to ensure the timely and accurate disclosure of material information\nrelating to the Company and/or its material subsidiaries in accordance with applicable securities\nlaws and stock exchange rules, to prevent the improper use or disclosure of material information\nor confidential information about the Company and to promote an understanding of and\ncompliance with legal requirements and stock exchange rules. The Board shall: (1) review the\nGuidelines on an annual basis; and, at a more appropriate time in the future, (2) implement\nadditional corporate governance policies and guidelines (3) implement measures and processes to\nreview critically each director's continuation on the Board every year considering, among other\nthings, a director's service on other boards and the time involved in such other service; and (4)\nestablish a process for the evaluation of the performance of the Board and each of its committees.\nBoard of Directors\nDirectors are considered to be independent if they have no direct or indirect material relationship\nwith the Company. A \"material relationship\" is a relationship which could, in the view of the\nCompany's Board, be reasonably expected to interfere with the exercise of a director's independent\njudgment.\n- 22 -\nThe directors of the Company exercise their business judgment to act in a manner they reasonably\nbelieve to be in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders. Directors must be willing\nto devote sufficient time and effort to learn the business of the Company, and must ensure that\nother commitments do not materially interfere with service as a director. In discharging their\nobligations, directors are entitled to rely on management and the advice of the Company's outside\nadvisors and auditors, but must at all times have a reasonable basis for such reliance. Directors\nare expected to spend the time needed to properly discharge their responsibilities.\nThe independent directors are given full access to management so that they can develop an\nindependent perspective and express their views and communicate their expectations of\nmanagement.\nCurrently, the independent member of the Board is Alan Friedman. Jody Aufrichtig and Warwick\nCorden-Lloyd are not independent by virtue of their being executives of the Company, Mr\nAufrichtig being the current Executive Chairman, and Mr Corden-Lloyd having been an executive\nofficer of the Company within the last three (3) years.\nDirectorships\nThe directors of the Company that are currently serving on boards of the following other reporting\ncompanies (or equivalent) is as set out below:\nDirector Other Reporting Issuer(s) Exchange\nJody Aufrichtig Psyence Biomedical Ltd NASDAQ\nAlan Friedman Osino Resources Corp.

The Board has found that the fiduciary duties placed on individual directors by\napplicable governing corporate legislation and the common law, as well as the restrictions placed\n- 23 -\nby applicable corporate legislation on the individual director's participation in decisions of the\nBoard in which the director has an interest, have been sufficient to ensure that the Board operates\nindependently of management and in the best interests of the Company.\nCompensation Committee\nAs of the date of this Circular, the Company has a compensation committee (\"Compensation\nCommittee\") comprised of the following members: Jody Aufrichtig, Warwick Corden-Lloyd and\nAlan Friedman.

Between annual meetings of shareholders, the Board may fill casual vacancies on the\nBoard and, subject to the Company's by-laws, increase the size of the Board and elect directors to\nfill the resulting vacancies until the next annual meeting of shareholders.\nEach director should possess the following minimum qualifications: (a) the highest personal and\nprofessional ethics, integrity and values; (b) commitment to representing the long-term interests\nof the shareholders; (c) relevant business or professional experience; and (d) sufficient time to\neffectively fulfill duties as a Board member. Non-management directors will endeavour to\nrecommend qualified individuals to the Board who, if added to the Board, would provide the mix\nof director characteristics and diverse experiences, perspectives and skills appropriate for the\nCompany.\nOther Board Committees\nThe Company does not have any standing committees other than the Audit Committee and the\nCompensation Committee.

To the best of the Company's knowledge, as\nof the date hereof, such persons and their associates own 22,898,611 common shares representing\napproximately 16% of the issued and outstanding common shares.\nThe complete text of the Stock Option Plan Resolution, which management intends to place before\nthe Meeting for approval, confirmation, and adoption, with or without variation, is as follows:\n\"BE IT RESOLVED THAT:\n1. the Stock Option Plan of Psyence Group Inc. as disclosed in the management information\ncircular dated May 1, 2024 be and is hereby approved;\n2. all unallocated options under the Stock Option Plan be and are hereby approved;\n3. Psyence Group Inc. has the ability to continue granting options under the Stock Option\nPlan until June 6, 2027, which is the date that is three (3) years from the date of the\nshareholder meeting at which shareholder approval is being sought; and\n4. any director or officer of the Psyence Group Inc. be and is hereby authorized to do such\nthings and to sign, execute and deliver all documents that such director and officer may, in\n- 29 -\ntheir discretion, determined to be necessary in order to give full effect to the intent and\npurpose of this resolution.\"\nManagement recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Stock Option Plan\nResolution. In the absence of contrary instructions, management proxyholders intend to vote\nFOR the Stock Option Plan Resolution.\nRe-approval of the RSU Plan\nThe Company's RSU Plan was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting of\nshareholders held on December 9, 2021. Pursuant to requirements of the CSE, the Company’s\nRSU Plan must be presented to the shareholders of the Company for renewal and for ratification\nof the unallocated entitlements every (3) years, failing which no further entitlements may be\nawarded under the RSU Plan. Accordingly, at the Meeting shareholders will be asked to consider,\nand if thought advisable, pass an ordinary resolution (the \"RSU Plan Resolution\"), to: (i) approve\nthe RSU Plan; and (ii) approve the unallocated entitlements available thereunder for the ensuing\nthree (3) years. A summary of the RSU Plan is provided in this Information under the heading\n\"Stock Option Plans and Other Incentive Plans – Restricted Share Unit Plan\". The full text of the\nRestricted Share Unit Plan is attached as Schedule \"D\" to this Information Circular.\nThe Board has concluded that the RSU Plan is in the best interest of the shareholders of the\nCompany. At the Meeting, shareholders entitled to vote on the matter will be asked to consider,\nand if thought advisable, to pass by ordinary resolution as set out below, to approve the RSU Plan\nResolution. To be effective, the RSU Plan Resolution must receive the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the votes cast by disinterested shareholders at the Meeting. Disinterested shareholder\napproval requires obtaining approval from the majority of votes other than votes attaching to\ncommon shares beneficially owned by directors and officers of the Company or their associates.\nSee \"Re-approval of the Stock Option Plan\" above for details on common shares beneficially\nowned by directors and officers or the Company.\nThe complete text of the RSU Plan Resolution, which management intends to place before the\nMeeting for approval, confirmation, and adoption, with or without variation, is as follows:\n\"BE IT RESOLVED THAT:\n1. the RSU Plan of Psyence Group Inc. as disclosed in the management information circular\ndated May 1, 2024 be and is hereby approved;\n2. all unallocated RSUs under the RSU Plan be and are hereby approved;\n3. Psyence Group Inc. has the ability to continue granting RSUs under the RSU Plan until\nJune 6, 2027, which is the date that is three (3) years from the date of the shareholder\nmeeting at which shareholder approval is being sought; and\n4. any director or officer of the Psyence Group Inc. be and is hereby authorized to do such\nthings and to sign, execute and deliver all documents that such director and officer may, in\n- 30 -\ntheir discretion, determined to be necessary in order to give full effect to the intent and\npurpose of this resolution.\"\nManagement recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the RSU Plan Resolution. In\nthe absence of contrary instructions, the management proxyholders intend to vote FOR the\nRSU Plan Resolution.\nApproval of Share Consolidation\nAt the Meeting, Shareholders will be asked to consider, and if deemed appropriate, pass a special\nresolution (the \"Share Consolidation Special Resolution\") to authorize the Board to effect, in\nits discretion and if they deem it appropriate, a share consolidation of the outstanding Common\nShares (the \"Share Consolidation\"), at a consolidation ratio within the range of two (2) and up to\ntwenty (20) Common Shares being consolidated into one (1) Common Share (the \"Consolidation\nRatio\"), such Share Consolidation, if passed by the Shareholders, will be effected by amending\nthe Company's articles after obtaining Board and regulatory approval. The Company believes that\nthe availability of a range of Share Consolidation ratios up to 10:1 will provide it with the\nflexibility to implement the Share Consolidation in a manner designed to maximize the anticipated\nbenefits for the Company and its shareholders. In determining which precise Share Consolidation\nratio to implement, if any, following the receipt of shareholder approval, the Board may consider,\namong other things, factors such as:\n• the historical trading prices and trading volume of the Common Shares;\n• the then prevailing trading price and trading volume of the Common Shares and the\nanticipated impact of the Share Consolidation on the trading market(s) for the Common\nShares;\n• the outlook for the trading price of the Common Shares;\n• threshold prices of brokerage houses or institutional investors that could impact their ability\nto invest or recommend investments in the Common Shares;\n• the greatest overall reduction in the Company’s administrative costs; and\n• prevailing general market and economic conditions.\nAt the close of business on May 1, 2024, the closing price of the Common Shares on the CSE was\nC$0.02. There were 140,031,222 issued and outstanding Common Shares on such date. Based on\nthe number of Common Shares currently issued and outstanding, immediately following the\ncompletion of the Share Consolidation, for illustrative purposes only, assuming a Share\nConsolidation ratio of 10:1, there would be approximately 14,003,122 Common Shares issued and\noutstanding. The Company does not expect the Share Consolidation itself to have any economic\neffect on shareholders or other securityholders.\n- 31 -\nReasons for the Share Consolidation\nThe Board believes that the Share Consolidation could heighten the interest of the financial\ncommunity in the Company and potentially broaden the pool of investors that may consider\ninvesting or be able to invest in the Company by increasing the trading price of the Common\nShares and decreasing the number of outstanding Common Shares. It could also help to attract\ninstitutional investors who have internal policies that either prohibit them from investing in public\ncompanies whose share price is below a certain minimum price or tend to discourage individual\nbrokers from recommending such stock to their customers.\nRisks Associated with the Share Consolidation\nReducing the number of issued and outstanding Common Shares through the Share Consolidation\nis intended to increase the per share market price of the Common Shares; however, the market\nprice of the Common Shares will also be based on other factors, which are unrelated to the number\nof shares outstanding. As a result, there can be no assurance that the market price of the Common\nShares will in fact increase following the Share Consolidation or will not decrease in the future. In\naddition, in the future, the market price of the Common Shares following the Share Consolidation\nmay not exceed or remain higher than the market price prior to the Share Consolidation and thus\nthe total market capitalization of the Common Shares after the Share Consolidation may be lower\nthan the total market capitalization before the Share Consolidation.\nWhile the Company believes that a higher share price could help to attract institutional investors\nwho have internal policies that either prohibit them from purchasing stock below a certain\nminimum price or tend to discourage individual brokers from recommending such stock to their\ncustomers, the Share Consolidation may not result in a share price that will attract institutional\ninvestors or that satisfy the investing guidelines of institutional investors.\nIf the Share Consolidation is affected and the market price of the Common Shares declines, the\npercentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of the Company’s overall market\ncapitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of the Share Consolidation. In many\ncases, both the total market capitalization of a company and the market price of such company’s\ncommon shares following a share consolidation are lower than they were before the share\nconsolidation. Furthermore, the reduced number of Common Shares that would be outstanding\nafter the Share Consolidation could adversely affect the liquidity of the Common Shares. The\nShare Consolidation will, in all likelihood, also result in some shareholders owning \"odd lots\" of\nfewer than 100 Common Shares on a post-consolidation basis. Odd lots may be more difficult to\nsell, or require greater transaction costs per share to sell, and brokerage commissions and other\ncosts of transactions in odd lots are generally somewhat higher than the costs of transactions in\n\"round lots\" of even multiples of 100 Common Shares.\nEffecting the Share Consolidation\nOnce the Company determines the consolidation ratio and that it is in the best interests of the\nCompany to proceed with the Share Consolidation, it will amend its articles in accordance with\nthe OBCA, upon which time the Share Consolidation will become effective. Concurrently, a new\n- 32 -\nCUSIP number will be assigned to the Common Shares and letters of transmittal will be distributed\nto Registered Shareholders in order to issue replacement share certificates or, alternatively, receive\na Direct Registration System (\"DRS\"), representing post-consolidation Common Shares.\nRegistered Shareholders will complete the letter of transmittal and return it along with the old\nshare certificate to the Transfer Agent. The Transfer Agent will then issue the new share\ncertificates to all Registered Shareholders who have validly submitted letters of transmittal. The\nDRS is an electronic registration system which allows Shareholders to hold Common Shares in\ntheir name in book-based form, as evidenced by a DRS Statement, rather than a physical share\ncertificate. Non-registered Shareholders who hold their Common Shares through a bank, broker or\nother nominee should note that such banks, brokers or other nominees may have different\nprocedures for processing the Share Consolidation than those that the Company may put in place\nfor the registered Shareholders. If you are a non-registered Shareholder and hold your Common\nShares with such a bank, broker or other nominee and if you have any questions in this regard, you\nare encouraged to contact your nominee.\nUntil surrendered, each share certificate representing old pre-consolidation Common Shares will\nbe deemed for all purposes to represent the number of whole post-consolidation Common Shares\nto which the holder is entitled as a result of the Share Consolidation. Until registered Shareholders\nhave returned their properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and surrendered\ntheir old share certificate(s) for exchange, registered Shareholders will not be entitled to receive\nany distributions, if any, that may be declared and payable to holders of record following the Share\nConsolidation. Any registered Shareholder whose old certificate(s) have been lost, destroyed or\nstolen will be entitled to a replacement share certificate only after complying with the requirements\nthat the Company and Odyssey, the transfer agent, customarily apply in connection with lost,\nstolen or destroyed certificates. The method chosen for delivery of share certificates and letters of\ntransmittal to the transfer agent is the responsibility of the registered Shareholder and neither the\ntransfer agent nor the Company will have any liability in respect of share certificates and/or letters\nof transmittal which are not actually received by the transfer agent.\nShareholders should not destroy any certificate(s) representing their Common Shares and\nshould not submit any share certificate(s) until requested to do so.\nAlthough approval for the Share Consolidation is being sought at the Meeting, the Share\nConsolidation, if approved by the Shareholders, will not become effective until the Board\ndetermines the precise Consolidation Ratio and the effective date of the Share Consolidation, and\npasses a resolution approving the Share Consolidation on that basis.\nTo be effective, the OBCA requires that the Consolidation Resolution be approved by a special\nresolution of the Shareholders, being a majority of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast\nby Shareholders that are present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting. In addition to\nthe approval of the Shareholders, implementation of the Share Consolidation Special Resolution\nis conditional upon the Company obtaining the necessary regulatory consents.\n- 33 -\nFractional Common Shares\nNo fractional Common Shares will be issued in connection with the Share Consolidation. In the\nevent that a Shareholder would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional Common Share upon\nsuch Share Consolidation, the number of Common Shares to be received by such holder will be\nrounded down to the nearest whole Common Share. The Share Consolidation will affect all\nShareholders uniformly and will not affect any Shareholders' percentage interest in the Company,\nexcept to the extent that the Share Consolidation would otherwise result in a Shareholder owning\na fractional share. In addition, the Share Consolidation will not affect any Shareholder's\nproportionate voting rights, subject to the treatment of fractional shares described above.\nThe terms of the Company’s Stock Options, RSUs, warrants and convertible securities that are\noutstanding prior to the implementation of the Share Consolidation will be adjusted to their terms\non at same Consolidation Ratio under the Share Consolidation, as applicable (ie; the number of\nCommon Shares issuable will decrease and the exercise price or conversion price, as applicable,\nwill increase proportionately).\nIf the Share Consolidation Special Resolution is passed by the requisite number of Shareholders\nat the Meeting and receives the necessary regulatory approvals, upon the filing of the articles of\namendment to implement the Share Consolidation, the Common Shares will be consolidated into\nnew Common Shares as described in this Information Circular.\nManagement recommends that shareholders vote in favour of Share Consolidation Special\nResolution and the Share Consolidation. In the absence of contrary instruction, management\nproxyholders intend to vote FOR the adoption of the Share Consolidation Special Resolution.\nAt the Meeting, Shareholders will be asked to consider and, if thought fit, to pass, with or without\namendments, the following special resolution:\n\"BE IT RESOLVED AS A SPECIAL RESOLUTION THAT:\n1. The board of directors of the Company (the \"Board\") is hereby authorized to determine,\nin its sole discretion, a consolidation ratio within the range of one post-consolidation share\nof the Company for every two to up to twenty pre-consolidation common shares of the\nCompany of the same class (the \"Consolidation Ratio\"), and the Company is hereby\nauthorized to change the number of the issued and outstanding common shares of the\nCompany (\"Common Shares\") pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) by\nconsolidating the issued and outstanding Common Shares on the basis of such\nConsolidation Ratio (the \"Share Consolidation\"), which Share Consolidation will become\neffective on a date in the future to be determined by Board, subject to the Board's authority\nto decide not to proceed with the Share Consolidation.\n2. The consummation of the Share Consolidation will be completed in a manner such that no\nfractional Common Shares will be issued in connection with the Share Consolidation and,\nin the event a shareholder would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional Common\nShare in connection with the Share Consolidation, the number of Common Shares to be\n- 34 -\nreceived by such shareholder shall be rounded down to the next lowest whole number of\nCommon Shares.\n3.
