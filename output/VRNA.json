D., President and Chief Executive Officer. “While it is still very early in the launch, we are extremely encouraged from the initial patient and HCP reports about Ohtuvayre’s potential to improve COPD symptoms regardless of COPD severity. This broad utilization across all patient types is consistent with market research and supports our belief that Ohtuvayre’s bronchodilator and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory activity is a significant advancement for COPD patients and can re-define the treatment paradigm.\n\n“In the third quarter, through the first seven weeks of launch, we recorded $5.6 million of net sales. We are excited by the continued acceleration as net sales for October exceeded the third quarter. More than 5,000 Ohtuvayre prescriptions were filled and more than 2,200 unique HCPs prescribed Ohtuvayre in just 12 weeks.\n\n“Alongside our successful Ohtuvayre launch, in the third quarter we initiated two Phase 2 clinical trials: a dose-ranging trial with glycopyrrolate, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”), supporting a nebulized fixed-dose combination program with ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD, and a trial assessing the efficacy and safety of nebulized ensifentrine in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (“NCFBE”).”\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Highlights**\n\n  * In August 2024, the Company launched Ohtuvayre for the maintenance treatment of COPD in the US.\n  * During the third quarter of 2024, the Company began enrollment in two new clinical programs: \n    * Phase 2 dose-ranging trial with glycopyrrolate, a LAMA, supporting a fixed-dose combination program for the maintenance treatment of COPD via a nebulizer.\n    * Phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy and safety of nebulized ensifentrine in patients with NCFBE.\n\n\n  * Following the end of the third quarter, the Company received notification from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that its permanent, product-specific J-code for Ohtuvayre, J7601, has been accepted and will be effective January 1, 2025.\n\n\n  * The Company recently presented additional analyses of data from the Phase 3 ENHANCE trials with ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2024 and at CHEST Annual Meeting 2024 (“CHEST”). Approximately 1,500 HCPs visited Verona Pharma’s medical and commercial booths for Ohtuvayre at CHEST.\n  * In September 2024, the Company’s development partner in Greater China, Nuance Pharma, completed enrollment in its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD in China. Results from the trial are expected in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter****2024****Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash position:** Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were $336.0 million (December 31, 2023: $271.8 million). The Company believes cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, along with product sales and funding expected to become available under the $650 million strategic financings completed in May 2024, will enable Verona Pharma to fund planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of 2026.\n  * **Product sales:** Net sales were $5.6 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 (Q3 2023: $0 million) related to product sales of Ohtuvayre. The Company received FDA approval on June 26, 2024 and the product was commercially available beginning in August 2024.\n  * **Cost of sales:** Cost of sales was $0.5 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 (Q3 2023: $0 million), which included Ohtuvayre manufacturing costs incurred after US approval, inventory overhead costs and sales-based royalties due to Ligand.\n\n\n  * **R &D Expenses:** Research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $10.6 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 (Q3 2023: $3.0 million). This increase of $7.6 million was primarily due to an $7.8 million increase in clinical trial and other development costs as we initiated two Phase 2 trials in the quarter.\n  * **SG &A Expenses:** Selling general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $35.2 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 (Q3 2023: $13.4 million). This increase of $21.8 million was driven primarily by a $9.7 million increase in people-related costs and $2.8 million in share-based compensation primarily related to our field sales team, which was hired in the lead up to the launch of Ohtuvayre. Additionally, marketing and other commercial related activities, including travel, increased by $7.5 million due to the launch. We also had an increase of $1.6 million related to professional and consulting fees, information technology costs and other support costs due to the continued build-out of our commercial organization.\n  * **Net loss:** Net loss was $43.0 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 (Q3 2023: $14.7 million).\n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information** Verona Pharma will host an investment community webcast and conference call at 9:00 a.m. ET / 2:00 p.m. GMT on Monday, November 4, 2024, to discuss the third quarter 2024 financial results and provide a corporate update.\n\nTo participate, please dial one of the following numbers and ask to join the Verona Pharma call:\n\n  * +1-833-816-1396 for callers in the United States\n  * +1-412-317-0489 for international callers\n\n\n\nA live webcast will be available on the Events and Presentations link on the Investors page of the Company’s website, [www.veronapharma.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mtRQ95fBSkoPjxSK8hmDjWWzBNBaexh_CoKEHGwImVGKx75rdESjB9DCtzH9zeLwOW9SwETfa3XtP-OZrCMfkBTmLhLRJ_iw0Q_1Ch1WNMo=), and the audio replay will be available for 90 days.

The analyses are published in the CHEST Annual Meeting on-line supplement.\n\nOhtuvayre (ensifentrine) is a first-in-class selective dual inhibitor of the enzymes phosphodiesterase three and phosphodiesterase 4 (“PDE3 and PDE4”) that combines bronchodilator and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory effects in one molecule. Ohtuvayre is the first novel inhaled mechanism for the maintenance treatment of COPD in more than 20 years.\n\nThe analyses will summarize the efficacy and safety of Ohtuvayre in subgroups of COPD patients including data supporting improvements in lung function, symptoms and quality of life, as well as reductions in the rate of exacerbations, regardless of COPD severity (moderate or severe), smoking status (current or former), and chronic bronchitis (with or without). Furthermore, an analysis of ensifentrine’s impact on reducing exacerbation rates and COPD-related healthcare resource utilization over 48 weeks will also be presented.\n\n“Ensifentrine is a remarkable addition to COPD therapy,” said William Stringer, MD, FCCP, Professor of Medicine in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “It has the capacity to bronchodilate, reduce inflammation, augment mucociliary clearance, and reduce exacerbations in smokers and former smokers.”\n\nDetails of Verona Pharma’s presentations and posters are listed below and linked to the CHEST website. In addition, the Company will present five presentations that will highlight the unmet need in COPD based on real world claims data.\n\n**Oral presentation:** [Ensifentrine improved lung function, symptoms, and quality of life regardless of COPD severity](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IShlrNAjxqdJcDUhgQzv2iUeKJrRH0wfPHuMKCEgvHL-f0wopbuuMfbi6x5MkMHHo0jjk0GqRzzPfhmKJVEMySbopBJcTlGeDZVgktCp2k0R-AbWLLIDRGSlXRx6-YGxtcDf4W7t3Wa2c2b3yor8nATJ6UhVGSUon-ZWDreVTI9m98c4q_9QhmXo8oz7i91fCeiQpIkbOshYGh2DvbhgHc4MY64iAJNdtyR8mW5t1di6RiYu39gE5ljLIZpnnnWP)**Presenter:** Jessica Bon, MD, Wake Forest University School of Medicine**Session:** Assessing Treatment Outcomes in Obstructive Lung Disease\n\n**Oral presentation:** [Ensifentrine, a novel COPD treatment, reduced COPD-related healthcare resource utilization over 48 weeks](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IShlrNAjxqdJcDUhgQzv2grV3_LiZeInFDsGU1sf8GOZvtAWd6nBOA-WFNc2nqjMMboIxoBYwon8u-FpwJjxRP5AHBuHereLfNfTSsK97OGebt6dukSZAesXQDIgHPYuVhu73B6SuoNLsVqxiJVu7Hadqpv9pxSfBHPDHxIcxSU1QYkwb51kpd2N61nEETdmB1xYacORJmLYyrpAVHthFmfcasfrFnVH7kGFIeNXn9ST26GxRgDWfyNtWWVjuytRuqdsfLki22VMa2HKSCkfxw==)**Presenter:** Emily Wan, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School**Session:** Emerging Treatments in Obstructive Lung Disease\n\n**Oral presentation:** [Ensifentrine improved lung function in patients with moderate to severe COPD: a pooled analysis from the Phase 3 ENHANCE trials](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IShlrNAjxqdJcDUhgQzv2iUeKJrRH0wfPHuMKCEgvHJ2WZdvkxEDf1tMh08yOogPqmOHkEUxSozwy0bQiGCd9Qyp0Tg5cTnD5Irx2Yt_I07pUvyJzqeptWyxnLze1SMWDZxt7Hd5WbzFw3E6NQ0bHzW7bAKYID25ijXc4JnBwpPl44eHEXD9gFifM7i6gXPV5Kfn4YaN08bTZkCyxbPsMjV9PQ-qJyiEyCP-74EECUfTmOfhX5GBVwORl7Acgj5P8-xuekGIRxVgmlxpDtfr5EleX6Eu3ZUqP85yFMi-Hvo=)**Presenter:** Diego J.

Organization and description of business operations\nVerona Pharma plc is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. Verona Pharma plc has one wholly-\nowned subsidiary, Verona Pharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with Verona Pharma plc, the\n“Company”). The address of the registered office is 1 Central Square, Cardiff, CF10 1FS, United Kingdom.\nThe Company is a biopharmaceutical group focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics for\nthe treatment of respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs. The Company’s American Depositary\nShares (“ADSs”) are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) and trade under the symbol “VRNA”.\nIn August 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) accepted for review the Company’s New Drug\nApplication (“NDA”) seeking approval of ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (“COPD”) and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) target action date of June\n26, 2024. The FDA filing stated it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the\napplication. The Company is preparing for a potential commercial launch in the third quarter of 2024, subject to\napproval of the NDA.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, and has an\naccumulated deficit of $414.4 million as of March 31, 2024. The Company expects to incur additional losses and\nnegative cash flows from operations until its products potentially gain regulatory approval and reach commercial\nprofitability, if at all.\nThe Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024, will be sufficient to fund its operating\nexpenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance.\nThe Company’s commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of products that are not expected to be\ncommercially available until the second half of 2024, if ever. Additionally, the Company may enter into out-\nlicensing transactions from time to time but there can be no assurance that the Company can secure such transactions\nin the future. Accordingly, the Company may need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve its business\nobjectives including to further advance clinical and regulatory activities, to fund launch related costs and to create an\neffective sales and marketing organization to commercialize ensifentrine, if approved. Any such funding will need to\nbe obtained through public or private financings, debt financing, collaboration or licensing arrangements or other\narrangements. However, there is no guarantee the Company will be successful in securing additional capital on\nacceptable terms, or at all.\n8\nVerona Pharma plc\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nNote 2 - Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Verona Pharma plc and its\nwholly-owned subsidiary Verona Pharma, Inc. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S.\nGAAP”) and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes\nincluded in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”). The\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023, was derived from audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded in the 2023 Form 10-K but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial\nstatements. The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to those consolidated financial\nstatements.\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted from these interim financial statements. The unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair\nstatement of results of operations, comprehensive income, financial condition, cash flows and shareholders' equity\nfor the periods presented. Except as otherwise disclosed, all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\nOperating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full\nyear.\nSegment reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is\navailable for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to\nallocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company has one operating and reportable segment,\npharmaceutical development.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, the\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nexpenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the accrual and prepayment of research and\ndevelopment expenses and the fair value of share-based compensation. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light\nof changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they\nbecome known, and actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates.\nRecently issued accounting standards not yet adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires\ndisaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on\nincome taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures\nthat would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual\nperiods beginning on December 15, 2024, and should be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the\nstandard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. This ASU will have no impact on the Company's Consolidated\nBalance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact to its income tax disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which\nimproves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant\nsegment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in\nwhich an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure\nrequirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The purpose of\nthe amendments is to enable investors to better understand an entity's overall performance and assess potential future\ncash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning on December 15, 2023 and\ninterim periods beginning on December 15, 2024 and should be applied on a retrospective basis for all periods\npresented. This ASU will have no impact on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated\n9\nVerona Pharma plc\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its segment\ndisclosures.\n10\nVerona Pharma plc\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nNote 3 - Equity interest\nThe Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the “Nuance Agreement”) with Nuance Pharma\nLimited (“Nuance Pharma”) effective June 9, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), under which the Company granted\nNuance Pharma the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ensifentrine in Greater China (China, Taiwan,\nHong Kong and Macau). In return, the Company received an unconditional right to consideration aggregating\n$40.0 million consisting of $25.0 million in cash and an equity interest, valued at $15.0 million as of the Effective\nDate, in Nuance Biotech, the parent company of Nuance Pharma.\nThe equity interest is recorded at cost as the Company has elected to use the measurement alternative for equity\ninvestments without readily determinable fair values. The Company evaluates this investment for indicators of\nimpairment quarterly. The Company did not identify events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant\neffect on the fair value of the investment during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nNote 4 - Accrued expenses\nAccrued expenses consisted of the following (in thousands):\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\nClinical trial and other development costs $ 1,182 $ 752\nProfessional fees and general corporate costs 4,402 2,039\nPeople related costs 2,685 794\nTotal accrued expenses $ 8,269 $ 3,585\nNote 5 - Debt\nOn December 27, 2023 (the “2023 Effective Date”), Verona Pharma, Inc. entered into a term loan facility of up to\n$400.0 million (the “2023 Term Loan” or “Loan Agreement”), consisting of a term loan advance in an aggregate\namount of $50.0 million funded on the 2023 Effective Date (the “Term A Loan”) and four additional term loan\nadvances subject to certain terms and conditions, as discussed below, in the amounts of $100.0 million (the “Term B\nLoan”), $75.0 million (the “Term C Loan”), $75.0 million (the “Term D Loan”) and $100.0 million (the “Term E\nLoan”). The 2023 Term Loan was entered into with Oxford Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company\n(“Oxford”), as collateral agent, and certain funds managed by Oxford and Hercules Capital, Inc. party thereto\n(collectively, the “Lenders”). The net proceeds of the 2023 Term Loan will be used for general corporate and\nworking capital purposes.\nEach advance under the Loan Agreement accrues interest at a floating per annum rate (the “Basic Rate”) equal to (a)\nthe greater of (i) the 1-Month CME Term SOFR (as defined in the Loan Agreement) reference rate on the last\nbusiness day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue and (ii) 5.34%, plus\n(b) 5.85%; provided, however, that (i) in no event shall the Basic Rate (x) for the Term A Loan be less than 11.19%\nand (y) for each other advance be less than the Basic Rate on the business day immediately prior to the funding date\nof such advance, (ii) the Basic Rate for the Term A Loan for the period from the 2023 Effective Date through and\nincluding December 31, 2023 was 11.19% and (iii) the Basic Rate for each advance shall not increase by more than\n2.00% above the applicable Basic Rate as of the funding date of each such advance. For the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 the effective interest rate was approximately 13% per annum. There was no material difference\nbetween the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the 2023 Term Loan outstanding.\n11\nVerona Pharma plc\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nNote 6 - Share-based compensation\nThe following table shows the allocation of share-based compensation between research and development and\nselling, general and administrative costs (in thousands):\nThree months ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nResearch and development $ 1,016 $ 1,103\nSelling, general and administrative 3,242 3,187\nTotal $ 4,258 $ 4,290\nThe following tables show the activity of each type of share-based compensation and are presented in ordinary\nshares.

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands except per share amounts):\nThree months ended March\n31,\n2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (25,794) $ (16,743)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 645,701 621,451\nNet loss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.04) $ (0.03)\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, outstanding share options, RSUs and PRSUs over 51.9\nmillion and 49.5 million ordinary shares, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per\nordinary share, because to do so would be antidilutive.\nNote 8 - Subsequent events\nCredit Agreement and Guaranty\nOn May 9, 2024 (the “2024 Effective Date”), Verona Pharma, Inc. (the “Borrower”) entered into a term loan facility\nof up to $400.0 million (the “2024 Term Loan”), consisting of a term loan advance in an aggregate amount of\n$55.0 million funded on the 2024 Effective Date (the “Tranche A Term Loan”), a term loan advance to be borrowed\nwithin three business days after the occurrence of certain terms and conditions in an aggregate amount of\n$70.0 million (the “Tranche B Term Loan”), a term loan advance available subject to certain terms and conditions in\nan aggregate amount of $75.0 million (the “Tranche C Term Loan”), a term loan advance available subject to certain\nterms and conditions in an aggregate amount of $100.0 million (the “Tranche D Term Loan”) and a term loan\nadvance available in the sole discretion of the lenders and subject to certain terms and conditions in an aggregate\namount of up to $100.0 million (the “Tranche E Term Loan”), with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC, a Delaware\nlimited liability company, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Agent”), and certain funds managed by\neach of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) and OCM Life Sciences Portfolio LP (“OMERS”) party\nthereto (collectively, the “2024 Lenders”). The proceeds of the 2024 Term Loan will be used for general corporate\nand working capital purposes, and a portion of the proceeds of the Tranche A Term Loan was used by the Borrower\non the 2024 Effective Date to repay in full the existing outstanding indebtedness owed under the 2023 Term Loan.\nThe 2024 Term Loan is governed by a credit agreement and guarantee, dated as of the 2024 Effective Date, by and\namong the Borrower, the Company, the Agent and the 2024 Lenders (the “Credit Agreement”). The Tranche B Term\nLoan will, subject to customary terms and conditions, be borrowed by the Borrower within eight business days after\nthe date the Borrower receives approval from the FDA of its NDA for ensifentrine; provided such approval is\nreceived prior to September 30, 2024. The Tranche C Term Loan will be available, subject to customary terms and\nconditions (including the prior borrowing of the Tranche A Term Loan and the Tranche B Term Loan), during the\nperiod commencing on the first Business Day following the date the Agent receives certification of the Company’s\nachievement of a specified net sales milestone and ending on December 31, 2025. The Tranche D Term Loan will be\navailable, subject to customary terms and conditions (including the prior borrowing of the Tranche A Term Loan,\nthe Tranche B Term Loan and the Tranche C Term Loan), during the period commencing on the first business day\nfollowing the date the Agent receives certification of the Company’s achievement of a specified net sales milestone\nand ending on June 30, 2026. The Tranche E Term Loan will be available at the 2024 Lenders’ sole and absolute\ndiscretion.\nThe 2024 Term Loan will mature on May 9, 2029. Each advance under the Credit Agreement accrues interest at a\nper annum rate equal to 11.00%. The 2024 Term Loan provides for interest-only payments on a quarterly basis until\nmaturity. Upon repayment (whether at maturity, upon acceleration or by prepayment or otherwise), the Borrower\nshall pay an exit fee to the 2024 Lenders in the amount of 2.50% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024\nTerm Loans to be paid (the “Exit Fee”). The Borrower may prepay the 2024 Term Loan in full or in part provided\nthat the Borrower (i) provides at least two (2) business days’ prior written notice to the Agent, (ii) pays on the date\n13\nVerona Pharma plc\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\nof such prepayment (A) all outstanding principal to be prepaid plus accrued and unpaid interest, (B) a prepayment\nfee of 7.00% of the 2024 Term Loans so prepaid if paid on or before the first anniversary of the 2024 Effective Date;\n5.00% of the 2024 Term Loans so prepaid if paid after the first anniversary of the 2024 Effective Date and on or\nbefore the second anniversary of the 2024 Effective Date; 2.00% of the 2024 Term Loans so prepaid if paid after the\nsecond anniversary of the 2024 Effective Date and on or before the third anniversary of the 2024 Effective Date or\n1.00% of the 2024 Term Loans so prepaid if paid after the third anniversary of the 2024 Effective Date and on or\nbefore the fourth anniversary of the 2024 Effective Date, (C) the Exit Fee and (D) all other sums, if any, that shall\nbecome due and payable under the Credit Agreement, including interest at the default rate with respect to any past\ndue amounts. Amounts outstanding during an event of default are due upon the Majority Lenders’ (as defined in the\nCredit Agreement) demand (except during a payment or bankruptcy event of default, whereupon such default\ninterest is automatically imposed) and shall accrue interest at an additional rate of 2.00% per annum, which interest\nshall be payable on demand in cash and (iii) any partial prepayment of the 2024 Term Loans shall be an aggregate\namount at least equal to $5.0 million in a denomination that is a whole number multiple of $1.0 million in excess\nthereof.\nThe 2024 Term Loan is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and the Company,\nincluding intellectual property, subject to customary exclusions and exceptions.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including\ntwo financial covenants: (i) commencing on the 2024 Effective Date, the Borrower is required to maintain certain\nlevels of cash, and, after the Account Control Agreement Completion Date (as defined in the Credit Agreement)\nsubject to control agreements in favor of the Agent, and (ii) commencing on the fiscal quarter of Company ending\non September 30, 2025, the Borrower and the Company are required to maintain quarterly trailing twelve-month net\nsales from the sale of ensifentrine in the United States; provided that such revenue covenant will be waived at any\ntime (x) the Borrower and the Company’s unrestricted cash balance subject to control agreements in favor of the\nAgent on the last business day of the applicable fiscal quarter is equal to or greater than the product of 1.25\nmultiplied by the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2024 Term Loans on such date or (y) the average daily\nclosing price of the Company’s American Depositary Shares for each of the thirty (30) trading days preceding the\nlast trading day of such fiscal quarter multiplied by the total number of issued and outstanding American Depositary\nShares of the Company is at least $1.0 billion. The Credit Agreement also contains other customary provisions, such\nas expense reimbursement, as well as indemnification rights for the benefit of the Agent and the 2024 Lenders.\nIn connection with the entry into the Credit Agreement, on the 2024 Effective Date, the Borrowers repaid in full all\noutstanding indebtedness and terminated all commitments under the 2023 Term Loan. The Borrower and the\nCompany did not incur any penalties, but did incur a prepayment fee and a final payment fee, as a result of the\nforegoing.\nRevenue Interest Purchase and Sale Agreement\nOn May 9, 2024, the Company and Verona Pharma, Inc. (collectively the “Sellers”) entered into a revenue interest\npurchase and sale agreement (the “RIPSA”) with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC, a Delaware limited liability\ncompany, as administrative agent and certain funds managed by each of Oaktree and OMERS (collectively, the\n“Purchasers”). Under the terms of the RIPSA, in exchange for each of the Purchaser’s payment to the Sellers of a\npurchase price of $100 million, in the aggregate, upon approval of ensifentrine by the FDA by a specified date and\nsubject to certain labeling conditions (the “Tranche A Purchase Price”), the Sellers agreed to a true sale of assigned\ninterests to the Purchasers, including a right for the Purchasers to receive 6.50% on the global net sales of\nensifentrine by the Sellers (the “Royalty Interest Payments”) and 5% on certain proceeds the Sellers receive from\nlicensees engaged during the term of the RIPSA outside of the U.S. (the “Ex-U.S. Payments”). The Sellers would\nbegin payment of the Royalty Interest Payments and Ex-U.S. Payments in the first fiscal quarter after receipt of the\nTranche A Purchase Price. The Sellers will also have a right to receive an additional funding tranche equal to\n$150 million (the “Tranche B Purchase Price”) upon achievement of a specified net sales milestone in any trailing\nsix-month period after receipt of the Tranche A Purchase Price and subject to certain terms and conditions. The\nRoyalty Interest Payments and Ex-U.S. Payments will cease upon reaching a multiple of 1.75 times the amounts\nactually funded by the Purchasers. The RIPSA includes a buy-out option, which provides us with the right to settle\nall outstanding liabilities at any time by paying a buy-out amount under various terms and conditions. The\nPurchasers have the right to terminate the RIPSA under certain conditions, including the Company’s insolvency, and\nthe Company’s divestment of ensifentrine, in which case we must pay the Purchasers up to 1.75 times the amounts\nactually funded by the Purchasers as of such default determination date. Pursuant to a security agreement signed in\nconnection with the RIPSA, the Sellers granted to the Purchasers a security interest in certain assets to secure\nobligations under the RIPSA.\n14\nItem 2. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as\ndisclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission on February 29, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).\nIn addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that constitute\nforward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,”\n“will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,”\n“believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar\nexpressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words.\nAll statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including\nwithout limitation statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and\nplans and objectives of management for future operations, the development of ensifentrine or any other product\ncandidates, including statements regarding the expected initiation, timing, progress and availability of data from\nour clinical trials and potential regulatory approvals and the expected regulations applicable to ensifentrine,\nresearch and development costs, timing and likelihood of success, potential collaborations, the duration of our\npatent portfolio, our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements, debt service obligations\nand our need for additional financing, the funding we expect to become available under the 2024 Term Loan and\nRIPSA and from cash receipts from U.K. tax credits, and the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to fund\noperations, are forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions and are based largely\non our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties,\nassumptions, and other important factors including, but not limited to, those set forth under Part II, Item 1A of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors” and Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K\nunder the heading “Risk Factors”. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and\nuncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our control, you\nshould not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.\nExcept as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements\ncontained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.\nWe intend the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be covered by the\nsafe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section\n21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\n15\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics for the\ntreatment of respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical need. Our product candidate, ensifentrine, is an\ninvestigational, first-in-class, inhaled, selective, small molecule and dual inhibitor of the enzymes phosphodiesterase\n3 and 4 (“PDE3” and “PDE4”), combining bronchodilator and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory activities in one\ncompound.\nInitially, we are developing inhaled ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease (“COPD”), a common, chronic, progressive, and life-threatening respiratory disease without a cure. If\nsuccessfully developed and approved, ensifentrine is expected to be the first inhaled therapeutic with a novel mode\nof action for the maintenance treatment of COPD in over 20 years.\nIn August 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) accepted for review our New Drug Application\n(“NDA”) seeking approval of ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD and assigned a Prescription Drug\nUser Fee Act (“PDUFA”) target action date of June 26, 2024. The FDA stated it is not currently planning to hold an\nadvisory committee meeting to discuss the application.\nBased on the results from our successful Phase 3 ENHANCE (“Ensifentrine as a Novel inHAled Nebulized COPD\nthErapy”) program, we believe ensifentrine, if approved, has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for\nCOPD. Ensifentrine met the primary endpoint in both the ENHANCE-1 and ENHANCE-2 trials demonstrating\nstatistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in measures of lung function. In addition, other\nendpoint data demonstrated that ensifentrine substantially reduced the rate and risk of COPD exacerbations in\nENHANCE-1 and ENHANCE-2. Ensifentrine was well tolerated in both trials.\nIf approved, we intend to commercialize inhaled ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD in the United\nStates (“U.S.”). Ensifentrine is not considered a drug device combination because patients use a readily available\nstandard jet nebulizer to take ensifentrine. Outside the U.S., we intend to license ensifentrine to companies with\nexpertise and experience in developing and commercializing products in those regions. To that end, we have entered\ninto a strategic collaboration with Nuance Pharma Limited, a Shanghai-based specialty pharmaceutical company\n(“Nuance Pharma”), to develop and commercialize ensifentrine in Greater China.\nIn Phase 2 clinical trials, ensifentrine has demonstrated positive results in patients with COPD, asthma and cystic\nfibrosis (“CF”). Two additional formulations of ensifentrine have been evaluated in Phase 2 trials for the treatment\nof COPD: dry powder inhaler (“DPI”) and pressurized metered-dose inhaler (“pMDI”).\nWe have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, and have an\naccumulated deficit of $414.4 million as of March 31, 2024. We expect to incur additional losses and negative cash\nflows from operations until our product candidates potentially gain regulatory approval and reach commercial\nprofitability, if at all.\nWe anticipate significant expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, if and as we:\n• establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure, ramp up production to commercial scale with our\nmanufacturing and other Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls activities to potentially commercialize any\nproducts for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n• continue the clinical development of our DPI and pMDI formulations of ensifentrine and research and\ndevelopment of other formulations of ensifentrine, as well as a fixed-dose combination of ensifentrine and a\nlong-acting muscarinic antagonist;\n• initiate and conduct further clinical trials for ensifentrine for the treatment of non-CF bronchiectasis, acute\nCOPD, CF or any other indication;\n• initiate and progress pre-clinical studies relating to other potential indications of ensifentrine;\n• seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n• seek regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n• maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n• add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including\npersonnel to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts and to support our\ncontinuing operations as a U.S. public company; and\n16\n• experience any delays or encounter any issues from any of the above, including but not limited to failed studies,\ncomplex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges.\nOn December 27, 2023, we entered into a term loan facility (the “2023 Term Loan”) of up to $400.0 million with\nOxford Finance LLC (“Oxford”), as collateral agent, and certain funds managed by Oxford and Hercules Capital,\nInc. At closing $50.0 million was funded with up to four additional advances of an aggregate $350.0 million\navailable subject to meeting certain regulatory and commercial milestones. Refer to Note 5 - Debt to our Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for\nadditional details.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 and funding expected to become available under\nthe 2024 Term Loan and the RIPSA will enable us to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure\nrequirements through at least the end of 2026 including the planned commercial launch of ensifentrine in the U.S., if\napproved. The remaining advances under the 2024 Term Loan and the RIPSA are contingent upon the achievement\nof certain regulatory and commercial milestones and other specified conditions. No additional advances are available\nunder the 2023 Term Loan following our termination and repayment in full of the 2023 Term Loan on May 9, 2024.\nRefer to Note 8 - Subsequent Events to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information\nregarding the 2024 Term Loan and the RIPSA.\n17\nClinical development update\nPhase 3 ENHANCE program\nWe reported positive top-line results from ENHANCE-2 and ENHANCE-1 in August and December 2022,\nrespectively. Ensifentrine successfully met the primary endpoints in both trials, demonstrating statistically\nsignificant and clinically meaningful improvements in measures of lung function in moderate to severe COPD\npatients. Improvements in symptoms and quality of life measures were shown in both trials, which reached statistical\nsignificance in ENHANCE-1. Other endpoint data showed ensifentrine substantially reduced the rate and risk of\nmoderate to severe COPD exacerbations and was well tolerated in both trials.\nThe ENHANCE trials were designed to evaluate ensifentrine as monotherapy and added onto a single\nbronchodilator. Each trial enrolled approximately 800 subjects, for a total of approximately 1,600 subjects, at sites\nprimarily in the U.S. and Europe. The two trials provided replicate evidence of efficacy and safety data over 24\nweeks and ENHANCE-1 also evaluated longer-term safety in approximately 400 subjects over 48 weeks.\nSubject demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups in both trials.\n• In ENHANCE-1 approximately 69% of subjects received background COPD therapy, either a long-acting\nmuscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”) or a long-acting beta-antagonist (“LABA”). Additionally, approximately 20%\nof all subjects received inhaled corticosteroids (“ICS”) with concomitant LAMA or LABA.\n• In ENHANCE-2 approximately 55% of subjects received background COPD therapy, either a LAMA or a\nLABA. Additionally, approximately 15% of all subjects received ICS with concomitant LAMA or LABA.\nHighlights\nPrimary endpoint met (FEV *AUC 0-12 hr)\n1\n• Placebo corrected, change from baseline in average FEV area under the curve 0-12 hours post dose at week 12\n1\nwas 87 mL (p<0.0001) for ensifentrine in ENHANCE-1 and 94 mL (p<0.0001) for ensifentrine in\nENHANCE-2.\n• Demonstrated consistent improvements with ensifentrine in all subgroups including gender, age, smoking\nstatus, COPD severity, background medication, ICS use, chronic bronchitis, FEV reversibility and geographic\n1\nregion.\nSecondary endpoints evaluating lung function met:\n• Placebo corrected, increase in peak FEV of 147 mL (p<0.0001) 0-4 hours post dose at week 12 in\n1\nENHANCE-1 and 146 mL (p<0.0001) in ENHANCE-2.\n• Placebo corrected, increase in morning trough FEV of 35 mL (p=0.0413) at week 12 in ENHANCE-1 and 49\n1\nmL (p=0.0016) in ENHANCE-2, supporting twice daily dosing regimen.\nExacerbation rate and risk reduced\n• Subjects receiving ensifentrine demonstrated a 36% reduction in the rate of moderate to severe COPD\nexacerbations over 24 weeks (p=0.0503) compared to those receiving placebo in ENHANCE-1 and a 43%\nreduction (p=0.0090) in ENHANCE-2.\n• In pooled exacerbation data from ENHANCE-1 and ENHANCE-2, ensifentrine demonstrated a 40% reduction\nin the rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations over 24 weeks (p=0.0012) compared to those receiving\nplacebo.\n• Treatment with ensifentrine significantly decreased the risk of a moderate/severe exacerbation as measured by\ntime to first exacerbation when compared with placebo by 38% (p=0.0382) in ENHANCE-1 and by 42%\n(p=0.0089) in ENHANCE-2.\n• In pooled exacerbation data from ENHANCE-1 and ENHANCE-2, ensifentrine significantly decreased the risk\nof a moderate/severe exacerbation as measured by time to first exacerbation when compared with placebo by\n41% (p=0.0009).\nCOPD symptoms and Quality of Life (“QOL”)\n18\n• In ENHANCE-1, daily symptoms as measured by E-RS** Total Score in the ensifentrine group improved from\nbaseline to greater than the minimal clinically important difference (“MCID”) of -2 units with a statistically\nsignificant improvement compared to placebo at week 24. Improvements in symptoms were early and sustained\nwith statistical significance versus placebo at weeks 6, 12 and 24. Similar improvements were demonstrated in\nENHANCE-2 but statistical significance was not achieved due to improvements observed in the placebo group\nover time.\n• In ENHANCE-1, QOL as measured by SGRQ** Total Score in the ensifentrine group improved from baseline\nto greater than the MCID of -4 units with a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo at week\n24. Improvements in QOL were early and sustained with statistical significance versus placebo at weeks 6, 12\nand 24. In ENHANCE-2, QOL as measured by SGRQ* Total Score in the ensifentrine group also improved\nfrom baseline to greater than the MCID of -4 units at weeks 12 and 24, numerically exceeding placebo at each\nmeasurement, but statistical significance was not achieved due to improvements observed in the placebo group\nover time.\nFavorable safety profile\n• Ensifentrine was well tolerated with very few adverse events occurring in more than 1% of subjects and greater\nthan placebo over 24 and 48 weeks.\n*FEV : Forced Expiratory Volume in one second, a standard measure of lung function\n1\n**E-RS, Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms, and SGRQ, St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, are validated\npatient reported outcome tools\nPlanned Clinical Development Activities\nEnsifentrine / Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonist (“LAMA”) fixed-dose combination\n19\nFixed-dose combination therapies such as LABA / LAMA, LABA / ICS and LABA / LAMA / ICS are commonly\nused in the treatment of COPD and, based on our market research, an unmet need exists for a nebulized fixed-dose\ncombination therapy. We believe the combination of ensifentrine with a LAMA could provide COPD patients with\nthe first nebulized fixed-dosed combination with the potential to provide bronchodilation through a dual mechanism\nand also non-steroidal anti-inflammatory effects via PDE inhibition. We are developing a fixed-dose combination\nformulation with ensifentrine and glycopyrrolate, a LAMA, for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD\nvia delivery in a nebulizer. We have filed patent applications in multiple jurisdictions including the U.S.\nIf a feasible formulation is developed, in the second half of 2024, we plan to submit an IND application to the FDA\nand, if allowed to proceed, initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of the fixed-dose\ncombination formulation in COPD patients.\nNon-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (“NCFBE”)\nNCFBE is a chronic lung disease characterized by persistent cough, excess sputum production and frequent\nrespiratory infections with more severe patients suffering exacerbations. The condition affects up to 500,000 adults\nin the U.S. and no therapies are specifically approved to treat it. Physicians currently use bronchodilators,\nantibiotics, steroids, mucus thinners and surgery.\nBased on the clinical results of ensifentrine observed in patients with COPD, including improvements in lung\nfunction and symptoms of cough and sputum, we believe that ensifentrine could potentially be an effective treatment\nfor NCFBE. We plan to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of nebulized ensifentrine\nin patients with NCFBE in the second half of 2024, if allowed to proceed by the FDA.\nNuance Pharma\nIn 2021, we entered into an agreement with Nuance Pharma for exclusive rights to develop and commercialize\nensifentrine in Greater China, with future potential milestone payments up to $179 million plus royalties. In August\n2022, Nuance Pharma received clearance from the Center of Drug Evaluation for its IND application to conduct\nboth Phase 1 and Phase 3 studies with ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD in mainland China.\nNuance Pharma initiated a Phase 1 trial with ensifentrine in healthy volunteers in March 2023. In April 2023,\nNuance Pharma dosed the first subject in its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating ensifentrine for the maintenance\ntreatment of COPD in mainland China.\nCritical accounting estimates\nThere were no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates described in the Company’s 2023\nForm 10-K during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nComponents of results of operations\nResearch and development costs\nResearch and development costs consist of salary and personnel related costs and third party costs for our research\nand development activities for ensifentrine. Personnel related costs include a share-based compensation charge\nrelating to our stock option plan. The largest component of third party costs is for clinical trials, as well as\nmanufacturing for clinical supplies and associated development, and pre-clinical studies. Research and development\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nAs the Phase 3 ENHANCE program has completed study conduct and analysis, we expect our research and\ndevelopment costs to decrease as compared to the prior year same period over the first half of 2024 until we add new\ncompounds or develop ensifentrine further in other delivery methods or indications. Due to the nature of research\nand development, the expected costs are inherently uncertain and may vary significantly from our current\nexpectations.\nSelling, general and administrative costs\nSelling, general and administrative costs consist of salary and personnel related costs, including share-based\ncompensation, expenses relating to operating as a public company, including professional fees, insurance and\ncommercial related costs, as well as other operating expenses.\n20\nWe expect commercial costs to significantly increase as we continue to develop our commercial operations, prepare\nfor a potential launch and, in the event of successful regulatory approval, incur sales force, marketing and other\nlaunch related costs. As we develop our knowledge of the market and refine our commercialization plans, expected\ncosts may vary significantly from our current expectations.\nOther income/(expense)\nOther income/(expense) are driven by interest income and expense, foreign exchange movements on cash and cash\nequivalents and taxes receivable, and the U.K. research and development tax credits (the “R&D tax credit”).\nWe participate in the U.K. Small and Medium Enterprises research and development tax relief program. The tax\ncredits are calculated as a percentage of qualifying research and development expenditure and are payable in cash by\nthe U.K. government to us. Credits recorded related to the 2022 and 2023 financial years are expected to be received\nin 2024.\nTaxation\nWe are subject to corporate taxation in the U.S. and the U.K. We have generated losses since inception and have\ntherefore not paid U.K. corporation tax. The income taxes presented in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nOperations and Comprehensive Loss represent the tax impact from our operating activities in the U.S., which\ngenerates taxable income based on intercompany service arrangements.\nU.K. losses may be carried forward indefinitely to be offset against future taxable profits, subject to various\nutilization criteria and restrictions. The amount that can be offset each year is limited to £5.0 million plus an\nincremental 50% of U.K. taxable profits.\n21\nResults of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table shows our statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in\nthousands):\nThree months ended March 31,\n2024 2023 Change\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 6,764 $ 12,610 $ (5,846)\nSelling, general and administrative 20,434 9,589 10,845\nTotal operating expenses 27,198 22,199 4,999\nOperating loss (27,198) (22,199) (4,999)\nOther income/(expense):\nResearch and development tax credit 585 2,313 (1,728)\nInterest income 3,378 2,677 701\nInterest expense (1,586) (293) (1,293)\nForeign exchange (loss)/gain (219) 932 (1,151)\nTotal other income/(expense), net 2,158 5,629 (3,471)\nLoss before income taxes (25,040) (16,570) (8,470)\nIncome tax expense (754) (173) (581)\nNet loss $ (25,794) $ (16,743) $ (9,051)\nResearch and development costs\nResearch and development costs were $6.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to costs of\n$12.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $5.8 million. This decrease was primarily\ndue to expense of $7.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 for finalizing all matters related to the\nPhase 3 ENHANCE program and related costs. As the program was completed in 2023, no similar costs were\nincurred in 2024. Additionally, there was a decrease in manufacturing process-related costs of $1.2 million due to\nour relative stage of development between the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. This decrease was\npartially offset by $1.5 million of pre-approval active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing-related costs as well\nas an increase of $0.7 million in people related costs including share-based compensation.\nSelling, general and administrative costs\nSelling, general and administrative costs were $20.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared\nto $9.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $10.8 million. This increase was driven\nprimarily by an increase of $4.6 million related to marketing, commercial preparation and other pre-commercial\nactivities, $1.1 million related to professional fees, consulting costs and other administrative expenses which support\nour continued growth and evolution of our business and $0.7 million related to the continued build-out of our\ninformation technology infrastructure. Additionally, we had an increase of $4.1 million in people related costs\nincluding share-based compensation as we continue to increase our headcount in our support functions in\npreparation for a potential commercial launch.\nOther income/(expense)\nOther income/(expense), net for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was income of $2.2 million compared to\nincome of $5.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $3.5 million. This decrease in\nincome was primarily due to a decrease of $1.7 million in the R&D tax credit as the three months ended March 31,\n2023 included the impact of finalizing all matters related to the Phase 3 ENHANCE program and related costs.\nAdditionally, there was an increase in interest expense of $1.3 million from the increase in our debt.\n22\nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree months ended March 31,\n2024 2023 Change\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of the period $ 271,772 $ 227,827 $ 43,945\nNet cash used in operating activities (13,610) (5,782) (7,828)\nNet cash used in investing activities (16) — (16)\nNet cash (used in)/provided by financing activities (3,123) 68,685 (71,808)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (141) 685 (826)\nCash and cash equivalents at end of the period $ 254,882 $ 291,415 $ (36,533)\nOperating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $13.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $5.8\nmillion during the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $7.8 million. The increase in cash used in\noperating activities was primarily due to the increase in net loss as a result of the costs incurred in preparation for the\nplanned commercial launch as well as an increase in people related costs.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $3.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net\ncash provided by financing activities of $68.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023, a change of $71.8\nmillion. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds received in the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 from the issuance of ordinary shares of $56.9 million and the proceeds from the draw\nunder our prior term loan with Oxford Finance Luxembourg S.À R.L. of $10.0 million.\n23\nLiquidity and capital resources\nWe do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. To date,\nwe have financed our operations primarily through the issuances of our equity securities, including warrants, from\nborrowings under term loan facilities and from upfront payments from the Nuance Agreement.\nWe have incurred recurring losses since inception, including net losses of $25.8 million for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, and $54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, we had an\naccumulated deficit of $414.4 million. We may continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable\nfuture as we expand our research and development efforts, advance our clinical development of ensifentrine in other\nformulations or for other indications, and seek to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize ensifentrine in\nvarious formulations or indications.\nWe have no ongoing material financing commitments, such as lines of credit or guarantees, that are expected to\naffect our liquidity over the next five years, other than leases, the 2024 Term Loan and the RIPSA.\nFunding requirements\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024, together with additional funding expected to\nbecome available under the 2024 Term Loan and the RIPSA, will enable us to fund planned operating expenses and\ncapital expenditure requirements through at least the end of 2026 including the planned commercial launch of\nensifentrine, if approved. Future advances under the 2024 Term Loan and the RIPSA are contingent upon\nachievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones and other specified conditions. We have based this\nestimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than\nwe currently expect. In addition, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors unknown to us. These\nfactors, among others, may necessitate that we seek additional capital sooner than currently planned. In addition, we\nmay seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we\nhave sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash\nequivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at these\ninstitutions may exceed insured limits.\nWe may require additional capital to commercialize ensifentrine, to continue the clinical development of our DPI\nand pMDI formulations of ensifentrine and to research and develop additional formulations of or with ensifentrine.\nIn addition, we may seek to initiate or conduct preclinical or clinical studies with ensifentrine in additional\nindications or to discover or in-license and develop additional product candidates. We may need to seek additional\nfunding through public or private financings, debt financings, collaboration or licensing agreements and other\narrangements. However, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in securing additional capital on acceptable\nterms, or at all.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership\ninterest of our shareholders and ADS holders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include\nliquidation or other preferences that adversely affect such holders’ rights as a shareholder or ADS holder. Any future\ndebt financing or preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include security interests in\nour assets and future revenue streams, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as\nincurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of\nwarrants, which could potentially dilute our security holders’ ownership interests.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties,\nwe may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product\ncandidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds\nthrough equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product\ndevelopment programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product\ncandidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur future capital requirements for ensifentrine or any future product candidates will depend on many factors,\nincluding:\n• the progress, timing and completion of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials for ensifentrine or any future\nproduct candidates and the potential that we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials for\nensifentrine;\n24\n• the number of potential new product candidates we decide to in-license and develop;\n• the costs involved in growing our organization to the size needed to allow for the research, development and\npotential commercialization of ensifentrine or any future product candidates;\n• the costs involved in filing patent applications and maintaining and enforcing patents or defending against\nclaims or infringements raised by third parties;\n• the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for ensifentrine or any future product candidate\nwe develop and any delays we may encounter as a result of evolving regulatory requirements or adverse results\nwith respect to ensifentrine or any future product candidates;\n• any licensing or milestone fees we might have to pay during future development of ensifentrine or any future\nproduct candidates;\n• selling and marketing activities undertaken in connection with the anticipated commercialization of ensifentrine\nor any future product candidates, if approved, and costs involved in the creation of an effective sales and\nmarketing organization; and\n• the amount of revenue, if any, we may derive either directly or in the form of royalty payments from future\nsales of ensifentrine or any future product candidates, if approved.\nOur commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially\navailable until the second half of 2024, if ever. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funds to\nachieve our business objectives.\n25\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we\nhad cash and cash equivalents of $254.9 million and $271.8 million, respectively, consisting primarily of money\nmarket funds. Our cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk and the rate of return would be negatively\nimpacted by a decrease in interest rates. Due to the short-term nature of our cash equivalents, a sudden change in\ninterest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of\noperations. There has been no material change to our interest rate sensitivity during the three months ended March\n31, 2024.\nWe also have exposure to market risk on our Loan Agreement. Each advance under the Loan Agreement accrues\ninterest at a floating per annum rate with a floor of the Basic Rate on the business day immediately prior to the\nfunding date for each advance and a ceiling of the Basic Rate plus 2.00%. As of March 31, 2024, $50.0 million of\nprincipal was outstanding under the Loan Agreement. The maximum possible change in interest rate of 2.00% per\nannum would not have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than its functional\ncurrency, the U.S. dollar. The Company’s expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2024 were incurred\nprimarily in U.S. dollars, but also included euros and pound sterling. As at March 31, 2024, approximately 6% of\ncash and cash equivalents and 10% of accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the\nR&D tax credit receivable is in pound sterling. Due to the relative magnitude of our foreign currency holdings, a\nchange of 1.00% in foreign exchange rates would not have a material effect on our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the\ndesired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that\nthere are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of\npossible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))\nunder the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such\nevaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2024,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nNo change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n26\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our ADSs involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as\nwell as the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations”. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of\nour ADSs could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not\npresently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a limited operating history and have never generated any product revenue.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history, and have incurred significant operating losses\nsince our inception. We had net losses of $25.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $54.4\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $414.4\nmillion. Our losses have resulted principally from expenses incurred in research and development of ensifentrine,\nour only product candidate, and from general and administrative costs that we have incurred while building our\nbusiness infrastructure. We may continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we\nexpand our research and development efforts, advance our clinical development of ensifentrine in other\nformulations, and seek to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize ensifentrine. We anticipate that our\nexpenses will increase substantially as we:\n• initiate and conduct clinical trials of ensifentrine for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis\n(“NCFBE”), cystic fibrosis (“CF”), asthma or other indications;\n• initiate and conduct other future clinical trials of ensifentrine in other formulations, including in combination\nwith other active ingredients including fixed-dose combinations, for the treatment of COPD or other indications;\n• initiate and conduct clinical pharmacology studies with any formulation;\n• seek to discover and develop or in-license additional respiratory product candidates;\n• conduct pre-clinical studies to support ensifentrine and potentially other future product candidates;\n• develop the manufacturing processes and produce clinical and commercial supplies of the ensifentrine active\npharmaceutical ingredient and formulated drug products derived from it;\n• seek regulatory approvals of ensifentrine;\n• grow commercial infrastructure to support the potential commercialization of ensifentrine, including sales,\nmarketing, operations, reimbursement and distribution infrastructure and scale-up manufacturing capabilities to\ncommercialize ensifentrine, if approved;\n• maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n• secure, maintain or obtain freedom to operate for our in-licensed technologies and products;\n• add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including\npersonnel to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts; and\n• expand our operations in the United States, the United Kingdom (“UK”) and possibly elsewhere.\nOur expenses may also increase substantially if we experience any delays or encounter any issues with any of the\nabove, including, but not limited to, failed pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, complex results, safety issues or\nregulatory challenges.\n27\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to the research and development, pre-clinical\nstudies and clinical trials, and commercialization of nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD\nin the U.S. We are continuing development of ensifentrine in other formulations and for other indications, and for\ncommercialization in other territories.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing, and eventually commercializing, products that\ngenerate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including\ncompleting clinical trials of ensifentrine in other formulations and other indications, discovering and developing\nadditional product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for ensifentrine and any future product candidates that\nsuccessfully complete clinical trials, establishing manufacturing, commercial and marketing capabilities and\nultimately distributing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the\npreliminary stages of some of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, we may\nnever generate revenue that is significant enough to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable\nto accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve\nprofitability. If we are required by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), or other regulatory\nauthorities to perform studies in addition to those we currently anticipate, or if there are any delays in completing\nour clinical trials or the development of ensifentrine or any other product candidates, our expenses could increase\nand revenue could be further delayed.\nEven if we do generate product royalties or product sales, we may never achieve or sustain profitability on a\nquarterly or annual basis. Our failure to sustain profitability would depress the market price of our ADSs and could\nimpair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A\ndecline in the market price of our ADSs also could cause our ADS holders to lose all or a part of their investment.\nWe will need additional funding to complete development and commercialization of any future product\ncandidates, or development and commercialization of other formulations or target indications of ensifentrine, if\napproved. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, or if a failure of any financial institution where we\nmaintain our cash and cash equivalents prevents or delays us from accessing uninsured funds, we could be\nforced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we\nconduct clinical trials and prepare for commercialization of ensifentrine, and develop and prepare for the\ncommercialization of ensifentrine in other formulations or for other indications. In addition, if we obtain regulatory\napproval for ensifentrine or any other product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses\nrelated to activities including product positioning studies, product manufacturing, medical affairs, marketing, sales\nand distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur ongoing costs associated with operating as a public company in the\nUnited States and maintaining a listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq. Accordingly, we will need to\nobtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital\nwhen needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development\nprograms or any future commercialization efforts.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval for ensifentrine for the treatment of COPD in the U.S., we estimate that our existing\ncash resources and additional funding expected to become available under the 2024 Term Loan and the RIPSA will\nenable us to fund planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of 2026\nincluding the commercial launch of ensifentrine. Future advances under the 2024 Term Loan and the RIPSA are\ncontingent upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones and other specified conditions. We\nhave based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital\nresources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors\nunknown to us. These factors, among others, may necessitate that we seek additional capital sooner than currently\nplanned. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations,\neven if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. We maintain the majority of\nour cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits\nat these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the\nevent of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no\nassurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or\ndelay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our business and financial position.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n28\n• the costs, timing and outcome of the regulatory submission and review of ensifentrine, including any post-\nmarketing studies that could be required by regulatory authorities, if regulatory approval is received;\n• the cost, progress and results of any other studies required to support the commercial positioning of ensifentrine\nfor the treatment of COPD, if regulatory approval is received;\n• the cost, progress and results of any clinical trials for the treatment of NCFBE, CF, asthma or other indications,\nor for other formulations of ensifentrine including fixed-dose combination products;\n• the cost of manufacturing clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies of the ensifentrine active ingredient\nand derived formulated drug products;\n• the scope, progress, results and costs of pre-clinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for\nensifentrine in other indications and of the development of DPI and pMDI formulations of ensifentrine, or\nfixed-dose combination formulations of ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD and potentially\nNCFBE, CF, asthma and other respiratory diseases;\n• the costs, timing and outcome of potential future commercialization activities, including manufacturing,\nmarketing, sales and distribution, for ensifentrine;\n• the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our\nintellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims, including any claims by third\nparties that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights;\n• the timing and amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of ensifentrine;\n• the sales price and availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement for ensifentrine;\n• the effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n• the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into\nlicensing or collaboration arrangements for ensifentrine, although we currently have no commitments or\nagreements to complete any such transactions.\nAny additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may\nadversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize ensifentrine. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future\nfinancing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, the terms of any\nfinancing may adversely affect our business, the holdings or the rights of our shareholders, or the value of our\nordinary shares or ADSs.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue\nour research and development programs relating to ensifentrine or any commercialization efforts, be unable to\nexpand our operations, or be unable to otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could\nharm our business and potentially cause us to discontinue operations.\nWe depend solely on the success of ensifentrine, our only product candidate under development. We cannot give\nany assurance that ensifentrine will receive regulatory approval for any indication, which is necessary before it\ncan be commercialized. If we, and any collaborators with whom we have entered or may enter into agreements\nfor the development and commercialization of ensifentrine, are unable to commercialize ensifentrine, or\nexperience significant delays in doing so, our ability to generate revenue and our financial condition will be\nadversely affected.\nWe do not currently generate any revenues from sales of any products, and we cannot give any assurance that we\nwill receive regulatory approval to commercialize ensifentrine in any indication and we may be unsuccessful in\ndeveloping and obtaining regulatory approval to commercialize any other marketable product. We have invested\nsubstantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of ensifentrine, and we do not have any\nother product candidate currently under development. Our ability to generate royalty and product revenues, will\ndepend heavily on the successful commercialization of ensifentrine, if approved. Ensifentrine will require regulatory\napproval, procurement of manufacturing supply, commercialization, substantial additional investment and\nsignificant marketing efforts before we generate any revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or\npromote ensifentrine or any product candidates in the United States, Europe or other countries before we receive\nregulatory approval from the FDA, the European Commission or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we\nmay never receive such regulatory approval for ensifentrine or any future product candidate. In August 2023, the\nFDA accepted for review our NDA seeking approval of ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD and\nassigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) target action date of June 26, 2024, but we cannot guarantee\n29\nthat it will be approved, or that it will be approved with the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful\ncommercialization of ensifentrine. In addition, we have not submitted a marketing authorization application\n(“MAA”) to the EMA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities. The success of ensifentrine will\ndepend on many factors, including the following:\n• we may not be able to demonstrate that ensifentrine is safe and effective as a treatment for our targeted\nindications to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authorities;\n• the applicable regulatory authorities may require additional pre-clinical or clinical trials, which would increase\nour costs and prolong our development;\n• the results of clinical trials of ensifentrine may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required\nby the applicable regulatory authorities for marketing approval;\n• the applicable regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of\nour clinical trials;\n• the contract research organizations (“CROs”) that we retain to conduct clinical trials may take actions outside of\nour control that materially adversely impact our clinical trials;\n• the applicable regulatory authorities may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials sufficient\nto demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of ensifentrine outweigh its safety risks or may disagree with\nour interpretation of data;\n• our ability to demonstrate a non-clinical safety profile that is acceptable to the applicable regulatory authorities;\n• unexpected operational or clinical issues may prevent completion or interpretation of clinical study results;\n• unexpected manufacturing issues, product performance issues or stability issues may delay or otherwise\nadversely affect the progress of our clinical development program;\n• if FDA or other regulatory authorities determine that inspections of the manufacturing facilities or clinical sites\nfor our product candidates are required in connection with a marketing application, and such regulatory\nauthorities are unable to conduct such inspections, whether due to geopolitical conflict, including war and\nterrorism, such as the ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, or travel restrictions, such as those\nimposed during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n• the applicable regulatory authorities may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites due to Good Clinical\nPractice (“GCP”) compliance issues, misconduct, or other reasons;\n• if our NDA is reviewed by an advisory committee, the FDA may have difficulties scheduling an advisory\ncommittee meeting in a timely manner or the advisory committee may recommend against approval of our\napplication or may recommend that the FDA require, as a condition of approval, additional pre-clinical studies\nor clinical trials, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions;\n• the applicable regulatory authorities may require development of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy\n(“REMS”) or similar risk management measures as a condition of approval;\n• the applicable regulatory authorities may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of our\nthird-party manufacturers;\n• the applicable regulatory authorities may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations;\n• if we license ensifentrine to others, the efforts of those parties in completing clinical trials of, receiving\nregulatory approval for, and commercializing ensifentrine;\n• through our clinical trials, we may discover factors that limit the commercial viability of ensifentrine or make\nthe commercialization of ensifentrine unfeasible;\n• if we retain rights under a collaboration agreement for ensifentrine, our efforts in completing pre-clinical studies\nand clinical trials of, receiving marketing approvals for, establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities for,\nand commercializing ensifentrine; and\n• if approved, acceptance of ensifentrine by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, effectively\ncompeting with other therapies, a continued acceptable safety profile following approval and qualifying for,\nmaintaining, enforcing and defending our intellectual property rights and claims.\n30\nAn unfavorable outcome in any of these factors could result in our experiencing significant delays or an inability to\nsuccessfully commercialize ensifentrine.\nWe cannot be certain that ensifentrine or any future product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive\nregulatory approval. Further, ensifentrine or any future product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even\nif they are successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for ensifentrine or any future\nproduct candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory\napprovals to manufacture and market ensifentrine or any future product candidates, our revenues will be dependent,\nin part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial\nrights. If the markets for patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not\ngenerate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\nWe have submitted an NDA for regulatory approval to commercialize ensifentrine in the United States. We may in\nthe future seek regulatory approval to commercialize ensifentrine in the European Union (“EU”) and additional\ncountries. While the scope of regulatory approval is similar in many countries, to obtain separate regulatory approval\nin multiple countries requires us to comply with the numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries\nregarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and\ndistribution of ensifentrine, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for investors to evaluate the success of our business to date\nand to assess our future viability.\nSince our inception in 2005, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing ensifentrine, building\nour intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain, planning our business, raising capital and providing\ngeneral and administrative support for these operations. We have completed multiple Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in\ndifferent formulations of ensifentrine and for different indications, and two registrational Phase 3 clinical trials for\nnebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD. We have not yet successfully obtained regulatory\napprovals or conducted sales, marketing and distribution activities necessary for successful product\ncommercialization. Additionally, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception, and\nwe expect our financial condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter\nand year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Consequently, any predictions\ninvestors make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer\noperating history.\nThe terms of our credit facility place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility, and our existing and\nany future indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nIn May 2024, Verona Pharma, Inc. entered into a term loan facility (the “Credit Agreement”), with Oaktree Fund\nAdministration, LLC, as administrative agent, (in such capacity, the “Agent”) and certain funds managed by each of\nOaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) and OCM Life Sciences Portfolio LP (“OMERS”) party thereto\n(collectively the “Lenders”), pursuant to which a term loan facility in an aggregate amount of up to $400.0 million,\nwhich we refer to as the 2024 Term Loan, is available to us in five tranches. We received the first tranche of $55.0\nmillion (the “Tranche A Term Loan”) at closing of the Credit Agreement. Each advance under the 2024 Term Loan\naccrues interest at a per annum rate equal to 11.00%.\nOur outstanding indebtedness, including any additional indebtedness incurred beyond our borrowings under the\n2024 Term Loan, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have significant\nadverse consequences, including:\na. requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash resources to the payment of interest and principal, reducing\nmoney available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product candidate development and other general\ncorporate purposes;\nb. increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;\nc. subjecting us to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions or obtain\nfurther debt or equity financing;\nd. limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we\ncompete; and\ne. placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt\nservicing options.\n31\nWe intend to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations with our then existing cash and cash equivalents.\nHowever, we may not have sufficient funds, and may be unable to arrange for additional financing, to pay the\namounts due under the 2024 Term Loan or any other debt instruments. Failure to satisfy our current and future debt\nobligations, including covenants to take or avoid specific actions, under the Credit Agreement could result in an\nevent of default and, as a result, the Lenders could accelerate all of the amounts due. In the event of an acceleration\nof amounts due under the Credit Agreement as a result of an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds or\nmay be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness while still pursuing our current business\nstrategy. In addition, our Lenders could seek to enforce their security interests in any collateral securing such\nindebtedness.\nFurther, if we are liquidated, the Lenders’ right to repayment would be senior to the rights of holders of our ADS or\nour ordinary shares to receive any proceeds from the liquidation. Any declaration by the Lenders of an event of\ndefault could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our ADS to decline. In\naddition, the covenants under the Credit Agreement, the pledge of our assets (including our intellectual property) as\ncollateral could limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. If we raise any additional debt financing, the\nterms of such additional debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe terms of the RIPSA place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility, and if we fail to comply with\ncertain covenants in the RIPSA, our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nIn May 2024, Verona Pharma plc and Verona Pharma, Inc. entered into a revenue interest purchase and sale\nagreement (the “RIPSA”) Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC, as administrative agent, and certain funds managed\nby each of Oaktree and OMERS party thereto (collectively, the “RISPA Purchasers”). Under the terms of the\nRIPSA, in exchange for the RIPSA Purchasers’ payment to us of a purchase price of $100 million in the aggregate,\nupon approval of ensifentrine by the FDA by a specified date and subject to certain labeling conditions (the\n“Tranche A Purchase Price”), we agreed to a true sale of assigned interested to the RIPSA Purchasers, including a\nright for the RIPSA Purchasers to receive a percentage on global net sales and an additional percentage on certain\nproceeds we receive from licenses outside of the U.S. We are also eligible to receive an additional funding tranche\nequal to $150 million upon achievement of a specified net sales milestone in any trailing six month period after\nreceipt of the Tranche A Purchase Price. The RIPSA contains covenants that impose on us certain obligations with\nrespect to payment, diligence, reporting, intellectual property, license agreements, and certain other actions, as well\nas indemnification obligations. Among other things, these covenants require us to use commercially reasonable\nefforts to develop and commercialize ensifentrine in the United States and each major jurisdiction in which a\nmarketing authorization is obtained, and limit our ability to create or incur liens or dispose of certain assets related to\nensifentrine. Compliance with these covenants may limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to\ntake actions that might otherwise be advantageous to us and our shareholders, including the holders of our ADS.\nPursuant to the RIPSA and related security agreement, we granted to the RIPSA Purchasers a second-priority lien in\ncertain of our intellectual property assets and other related assets to secure our obligations under the RIPSA. If we\nare unable to comply with our obligations, the RIPSA Purchasers could seek to enforce their security interest in such\nassets.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our holders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish\nrights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs\nthrough a combination of securities offerings, debt financings, license and collaboration agreements and research\ngrants. If we raise capital through securities offerings, the ownership interest of our ADS holders and shareholders\nwill be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect\nthese holders’ rights as holders of our ADSs. Debt financing, if available, could result in fixed payment obligations,\nand we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional\ndebt, to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights, to make capital expenditures, to declare dividends, or\nother operating restrictions. If we raise additional funds through collaboration or licensing agreements, we may have\nto relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on\nterms that may not be favorable to us. In addition, we could also be required to seek funds through arrangements\nwith collaborators or others at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable. If we raise funds through research\ngrants, we may be subject to certain requirements, which may limit our ability to use the funds or require us to share\ninformation from our research and development. Raising additional capital through any of these or other means\ncould adversely affect our business and the holdings or rights of our ADS holders and shareholders, and may cause\nthe market price of our ADSs to decline.\n32\nOur business may become subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international\noperations.\nAs a company based in the United Kingdom and listed on Nasdaq, our business is subject to risks associated with\nconducting business internationally. Many of our suppliers and collaborative and clinical trial relationships are\nlocated outside the United Kingdom and the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a\nvariety of factors, including:\n• economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular non-U.S. economies and markets;\n• differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals in non-U.S. countries;\n• differing jurisdictions could present different issues for securing, maintaining or obtaining freedom to operate in\nsuch jurisdictions;\n• potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n• difficulties in compliance with non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n• changes in non-U.S. regulations and customs, tariffs and trade barriers;\n• changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates of the euro and currency controls;\n• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic environment;\n• trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by U.S. or non-\nU.S. governments;\n• differing reimbursement regimes and price controls in certain non-U.S. markets;\n• negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n• compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n• workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n• difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations, including differing labor relations;\n• production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities\nabroad; and\n• business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, such as the ongoing\nconflicts in Europe and the Middle East, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires,\nor public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nExchange rate fluctuations may materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we are based in the United Kingdom, our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and many\nof our business activities are carried out with partners outside the U.S. and United Kingdom and these transactions\nmay be denominated in another currency. As a result, our business and the price of our ADSs may be affected by\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates not only between the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, but also the\ncurrencies of other countries, which may have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows from\nperiod to period. Currently, we do not have any exchange rate hedging arrangements in place.\nRisks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval\nClinical drug development and regulatory approval involve a lengthy and expensive process, with uncertain\noutcomes. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete,\nthe development and regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nClinical drug development is a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and uncertain outcomes. If\nclinical trials of ensifentrine are prolonged or delayed, or if ensifentrine in later stage clinical trials fails to show the\nsafety and efficacy required by regulatory authorities, we or our collaborators may be unable to obtain required\nregulatory approvals and be unable to commercialize ensifentrine on a timely basis, or at all.\nTo obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell ensifentrine, we or any collaborator for ensifentrine\nmust demonstrate through extensive pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that ensifentrine is safe and effective in\nhumans. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain.\n33\nFailure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of pre-clinical studies and early-stage\nclinical trials of ensifentrine may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in\nlater stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through\npre-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. Regulators’ interpretations of results may differ from our own, and\nexpectations can change over time while a product is in clinical development.\nA number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical\ntrials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. The FDA\nmay require us to conduct additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials that may not be successful, or may not be\nconsidered successful by regulators. With respect to ensifentrine, our only product candidate, we have completed\nmultiple Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for different formulations of ensifentrine and for different indications, and two\nregistrational Phase 3 clinical trials for nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD. Based on the\nresults from these studies, we submitted an NDA seeking approval of ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of\nCOPD, and in August 2023, the FDA accepted for review our NDA and assigned a PDUFA target action date of\nJune 26, 2024.\nIf we wish to commercialize nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD in other territories, the\nregulatory authorities in such territories may require us to conduct additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials,\nand if we wish to commercialize ensifentrine in other formulations or for other indications, we will be required to\nconduct further clinical studies.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials of ensifentrine in different formulations, including fixed-dose\ncombinations, and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll\npatients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Our clinical trials can be delayed, suspended, or terminated,\nor the utility of data from these trials may be compromised, for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n• inability to generate sufficient preclinical, toxicology, drug product characterizations or other in vivo or in vitro\ndata to support the initiation or continuation of clinical trials;\n• delays in or failure to obtain regulatory agreement on clinical trial design or implementation, including dose and\nfrequency of administration;\n• delays in or failure to obtain regulatory authorization to commence a trial;\n• delays in or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the\nterms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and\ntrial sites;\n• inability of a CRO to meet their contracted obligations regarding subject enrollment, data collection, data\nmonitoring, laboratory sample management, programming and analysis or other activities;\n• delays in or failure to obtain institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee approval or positive\nopinion at each site;\n• delays in or failure to recruit suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n• failure to have patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n• clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial or committing gross misconduct or fraud;\n• delays to the addition of new clinical trial sites;\n• inability to achieve or maintain double blinding of ensifentrine;\n• unexpected technical issues during manufacture of ensifentrine and the corresponding drug products;\n• variability in drug product performance and/or stability;\n• discoveries that may reduce the commercial viability of ensifentrine;\n• inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of ensifentrine for use in clinical trials;\n• the quality or stability of ensifentrine falling below acceptable standards for either safety or efficacy;\n• third-party actions claiming infringement by ensifentrine in clinical trials and obtaining injunctions interfering\nwith our progress;\n34\n• business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, such as the ongoing\nconflicts in Europe and the Middle East, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires;\n• trade sanctions imposed by the United States or other governments impacting our ability to transfer money to\ncertain countries, such as Russia, to pay clinical trials sites in those countries;\n• safety or tolerability concerns causing us or our collaborators, as applicable, to suspend or terminate a trial if we\nor our collaborators find that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n• changes in regulatory requirements, policies and guidelines;\n• lower than anticipated retention rates of patients and volunteers in clinical trials;\n• failure of our third-party research contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or to meet their\ncontractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; and\n• difficulty in certain countries in identifying the sub-populations that we are trying to evaluate in a particular\ntrial, which may delay enrollment.\nWe could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in\nwhich such trials are being conducted, by the Data Review Committee or Data Safety Monitoring Board for such\ntrial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination\ndue to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements\nor our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory\nauthorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to\ndemonstrate a benefit from using a drug, failure of our clinical trials to demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety,\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical\ntrial.\nMoreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from\ntime to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be\nrequired to report some of these relationships to the FDA or other regulatory authority. The FDA or other regulatory\nauthority may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of\ninterest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA or other regulatory authority may therefore\nquestion the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself\nmay be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA\nor other regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of\nensifentrine.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of any clinical trial of ensifentrine for any indication, or of any other\nproduct candidate, or any clinical trial of ensifentrine or any other product candidate is terminated, the commercial\nprospects of such product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues, if any, will be\ndelayed. Moreover, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down the development\nand approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue, if any. Significant\nclinical trial delays could also allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do or shorten any periods\nduring which we have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates and could impair our ability to\ncommercialize our product candidates. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the\ncommencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of\nensifentrine or any other product candidate.\nClinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the FDA, EU rules and regulations\nand other applicable regulatory authorities’ legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, and are subject to oversight\nby these governmental agencies and IRBs (or other ethics committees) at the medical institutions where the clinical\ntrials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with supplies of ensifentrine produced under\ncurrent good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) and similar foreign requirements and other regulations. Furthermore,\nwe rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and while we\nhave agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. We\ndepend on our collaborators and on medical institutions and CROs to conduct our clinical trials in compliance with\nGCP requirements. To the extent our collaborators or the CROs fail to enroll participants for our clinical trials, fail\nto conduct the study to GCP standards or are delayed for a significant time in the execution of trials, including\nachieving full enrollment, we may be affected by increased costs, program delays or both. In addition, clinical trials\nthat are conducted in countries outside the EU and the United States may subject us to further delays and expenses\nas a result of increased shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of non-EU and non-\n35\nU.S. CROs, as well as expose us to risks associated with clinical investigators who are unknown to the FDA or the\nEMA, and different standards of diagnosis, screening and medical care.\nIn addition, the FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies with respect to clinical trials may change and\nadditional government regulations may be enacted. For instance, the regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in\nthe EU recently evolved. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (“CTR”), which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals\nthe EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. While the EU Clinical Trials Directive\nrequired a separate clinical trial application (“CTA”), to be submitted in each member state in which the clinical trial\ntakes place, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, the CTR\nintroduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application for multi-center trials. The\nCTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each\nmember state, leading to a single decision per member state. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been\nharmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each\nmember state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member\nstate’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical\nstudy development may proceed. The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and\nnew clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. Clinical trials for which an application was submitted (i)\nprior to January 31, 2022 under the EU Clinical Trials Directive, or (ii) between January 31, 2022 and January 31,\n2023 and for which the sponsor has opted for the application of the EU Clinical Trials Directive remain governed by\nsaid Directive until January 31, 2025. After this date, all clinical trials (including those which are ongoing) will\nbecome subject to the provisions of the CTR. Compliance with the CTR requirements by us and our third-party\nservice providers, such as CROs, may impact our developments plans.\nIt is currently unclear to what extent the U.K. will seek to align its regulations with the EU. The U.K. regulatory\nframework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented into U.K. law,\nthrough secondary legislation).\nOn January 17, 2022, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), launched an\neight-week consultation on reframing the U.K. legislation for clinical trials, which aimed to streamline clinical trials\napprovals, enable innovation, enhance clinical trials transparency, enable greater risk proportionality, and promote\npatient and public involvement in clinical trials. The resulting legislative changes will be closely watched and will\ndetermine the extent to which the U.K. clinical trials framework aligns with or diverges from the (EU) CTR. Under\nthe terms of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, provisions of the (EU) CTR which relate to the manufacture\nand import of investigational medicinal products and auxiliary medicinal products apply in Northern Ireland. A\ndecision by the U.K. Government not to closely align its regulations with the new approach that has been adopted in\nthe EU may have an effect on the cost of conducting clinical trials in the U.K. compared with other countries.\nIf we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies\ngoverning clinical trials, our development plans may be impacted.\nEnsifentrine may have serious adverse, undesirable or unacceptable side effects which may delay or prevent\nmarketing approval. If such side effects are identified during the development of ensifentrine or following\napproval, if any, we may need to abandon our development of ensifentrine, the commercial profile of any\napproved label may be limited, or we may be subject to other significant negative consequences following\nmarketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects that may be caused by ensifentrine could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt,\ndelay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive or less desirable label or the delay or denial of\nregulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. During the conduct of clinical trials,\npatients report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is\nnot possible to determine whether or not the product candidate being studied caused these conditions. It is possible\nthat as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials, or as use of these product\ncandidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other\nadverse events that were observed in previous trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in\nprevious trials, will be reported by patients. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational\nproducts are tested in large-scale clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients on a\ncommercial scale following approval. We have completed more than 20 Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials of\nensifentrine. In these trials, some patients have experienced mild to moderate adverse reactions, including urinary\ntract infection, back pain and hypertension.\nResults of our future clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of adverse side\neffects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or other comparable foreign\n36\nregulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of ensifentrine for any or all\ntargeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients\nto complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Additionally, if ensifentrine receives marketing\napproval and we or others identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by ensifentrine, a number of\npotentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n• regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such products and require us to take ensifentrine off the\nmarket;\n• regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication or\nfield alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n• regulatory authorities may require a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to\npatients, or that we implement a REMS plan or similar risk management measures to ensure that the benefits of\nensifentrine outweigh its risks;\n• we may be required to change the way ensifentrine is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change\nthe labeling of ensifentrine;\n• we may be subject to limitations on how we may promote ensifentrine;\n• sales of ensifentrine may be adversely impacted;\n• we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n• our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or any collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of\nensifentrine or could have significant negative consequences on the commercialization of ensifentrine, which in turn\ncould delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from the sale of ensifentrine.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to develop ensifentrine in different formulations, including fixed-dose\ncombinations, and/or for multiple indications, including NCFBE, CF, asthma or other respiratory diseases.\nPart of our strategy is to continue to develop ensifentrine in indications other than COPD, such as NCFBE, CF and\nasthma and other formulations including fixed-dose combinations, MDI and DPI. Although our research and\ndevelopment efforts to date have suggested that ensifentrine has the potential to treat NCFBE, CF and asthma, we\nmay not be able to develop ensifentrine in these indications or any other disease, or development may not be\nsuccessful. In addition, the potential use of ensifentrine in other diseases may not be suitable for clinical\ndevelopment, including as a result of difficulties enrolling patients in any clinical studies we plan to initiate or the\npotential for harmful side effects or other characteristics that might suggest marketing approval and market\nacceptance are unlikely. We may find that it may not be feasible to develop an acceptable combination of\nensifentrine in combination with other products, including LAMAs, or that chemical stability or drug product\nstability does not support further development. If we do not continue to successfully develop and begin to\ncommercialize ensifentrine for multiple indications or formulations, we will face difficulty in obtaining product\nrevenues in future periods, which could significantly harm our financial position.\nWe depend on enrollment of patients in our clinical trials for ensifentrine. If we are unable to enroll patients in\nour clinical trials, or enrollment is slower than anticipated, our research and development efforts could be\nadversely affected.\nSuccessful and timely completion of clinical trials for ensifentrine will require that we enroll a sufficient number of\npatient candidates. Trials may be subject to delays as a result of patient enrollment taking longer than anticipated or\npatient withdrawal and other external factors. Patient enrollment depends on many factors, including the size and\nnature of the patient population, the severity of the disease under investigation, eligibility criteria for the trial, the\nproximity of patients to clinical sites, the design of the clinical protocol, the ability to obtain and maintain patient\nconsents, the risk that enrolled patients will drop out of a trial, the availability of competing clinical trials, the\navailability of new drugs approved for the indication the clinical trial is investigating and clinicians’ and patients’\nperceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies. These\nfactors may make it difficult for us to enroll enough patients to complete our clinical trials in a timely and cost-\neffective manner. Higher than expected numbers of patients could also discontinue participation in the clinical trials.\nDelays in the completion of any clinical trial of ensifentrine or other product candidates will increase our costs, slow\ndown our development and approval of ensifentrine and delay or potentially jeopardize our ability to commence\nproduct sales and generate revenue. In addition, some of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the\n37\ncommencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of\nensifentrine.\nWe may become exposed to costly and damaging liability claims, either when testing ensifentrine in the clinic or\nat the commercial stage, and our product liability insurance may not cover all damages from such claims.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability and professional indemnity risks that are inherent in the research,\ndevelopment, manufacturing, marketing and use of pharmaceutical products. Currently, we have no products that\nhave been approved for commercial sale; however, the current and future use of ensifentrine by us and any\ncollaborators in clinical trials, and the sale of ensifentrine, if approved, in the future, may expose us to liability\nclaims. These claims might be made by patients that use the product, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical\ncompanies, our collaborators or others selling ensifentrine. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could be\ndifficult and costly to defend and could adversely affect the market for ensifentrine or any prospects for\ncommercialization of ensifentrine. In addition, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may\nresult in:\n• decreased demand for ensifentrine;\n• injury to our reputation;\n• withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n• costs to defend related litigation;\n• diversion of management’s time and our resources;\n• substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n• regulatory investigation, product recalls or withdrawals, or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n• loss of revenue; and\n• the inability to commercialize or promote ensifentrine.\nAlthough the clinical trial process is designed to identify and assess potential side effects, it is always possible that a\ndrug, even after regulatory approval, may exhibit unforeseen side effects. If ensifentrine were to cause adverse side\neffects during clinical trials or after approval, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities. Physicians and patients\nmay not comply with any warnings that identify known potential adverse effects and patients who should not use\nensifentrine.\nAlthough we maintain product liability insurance for ensifentrine, it is possible that our liabilities could exceed our\ninsurance coverage. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we\nobtain marketing approval for ensifentrine. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a\nreasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. If a\nsuccessful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of\ninsured liabilities, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be\nimpaired.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA, the EMA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are\nlengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory\napproval for ensifentrine, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA, the European Commission and comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and\ndepends upon numerous factors, including substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval\npolicies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the\ncourse of a product candidate’s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained\nregulatory approval for ensifentrine and it is possible that ensifentrine or any product candidates we may develop in\nthe future will never obtain regulatory approval.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our\ncollaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction\nof the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, that such product candidate is safe and effective for its intended uses.\nResults from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the\nnonclinical or clinical data for our product candidate are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support\napproval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may also require us\n38\nto conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for ensifentrine either prior to or post-approval, or it may\nobject to elements of our clinical development program.\nEnsifentrine could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n• we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities that ensifentrine is safe and effective, with the required level of statistical significance, for its\nproposed indication;\n• we may be unable to demonstrate that ensifentrine’s benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n• the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data\nfrom pre-clinical studies or clinical trials or may find the data to be unacceptable;\n• the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find that the dose or doses evaluated in\nPhase 3 clinical trials or the way in which double blinding was effected to be unacceptable;\n• the data collected from clinical trials of ensifentrine may, for various reasons, be insufficient to support the\nsubmission or approval of an NDA in the United States, a MAA in the EU, or other comparable submission to\nobtain regulatory approval in other countries;\n• the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or\nfacilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n• FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may identify issues of GCP noncompliance or unacceptable practices\nat clinical sites or CROs participating in our clinical studies, rendering clinical data insufficient to support\napproval;\n• the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly\nchange in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval;\n• the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or\nimplementation of our clinical trials; and\n• the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our proposed product\nspecifications and performance characteristics.\nThis lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to\nobtain regulatory approval to market ensifentrine. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities have\nsubstantial discretion in the approval process, and determining when or whether regulatory approval will be obtained\nfor ensifentrine. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of ensifentrine are promising, such data\nmay not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA, the European Commission or any other regulatory authority.\nIn addition, even if we were to obtain approval for any jurisdiction, regulatory authorities may approve ensifentrine\nfor fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for\nensifentrine, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may\napprove ensifentrine with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful\ncommercialization of ensifentrine. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects\nfor ensifentrine.\nIn addition, FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change their approval policies and new regulations may be\nenacted. For instance, the EU pharmaceutical legislation is currently undergoing a complete review process, in the\ncontext of the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe initiative, launched by the European Commission in November\n2020. The European Commission’s proposal for revision of several legislative instruments related to medicinal\nproducts (potentially reducing the duration of regulatory data protection, revising the eligibility for expedited\npathways, etc.) was published on April 26, 2023. The proposed revisions remain to be agreed and adopted by the\nEuropean Parliament and European Council and the proposals may therefore be substantially revised before\nadoption, which is not anticipated before early 2026. The revision may however have a significant impact on the\nbiopharmaceutical industry and our business in the long term.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns\ncould hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or\nmodified products from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could\nnegatively impact our business.\n39\nThe ability of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities to review and approve new products can be\naffected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy\nchanges, the FDA’s or foreign regulatory authorities’ ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment\nof user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA’s or foreign regulatory authorities’ ability to\nperform routine functions. Average review times at the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have fluctuated in\nrecent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and\ndevelopment activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at\nthe FDA and other agencies, such as the EMA following its relocation to Amsterdam and resulting staff changes,\nmay also slow the time necessary for new drugs, or modifications to cleared or approved drugs, to be reviewed and/\nor approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the\nlast several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the\nFDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nEven if ensifentrine obtains regulatory approval, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued\nregulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, ensifentrine, if approved,\ncould be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we\nfail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with ensifentrine.\nIf the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves ensifentrine, the manufacturing processes,\nlabeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping for\nensifentrine will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include payment\nof annual user fees, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, facility registration and\ndrug listing, as well as continued compliance with cGMP and similar foreign requirements for the manufacture of\nensifentrine and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval, all of which may result in\nsignificant expense and limit our ability to commercialize ensifentrine. In addition, any approval we may obtain for\nensifentrine may contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings,\nprecautions or contraindications, and may include burdensome post-approval study or risk management\nrequirements. For example, the FDA may require a REMS in order to approve our product candidates, which could\nentail requirements for a medication guide, physician training and communication plans or additional elements to\nensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.\nWe and our contract manufacturers will also be subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory\nauthorities to monitor compliance with these requirements and the terms of any product approval we may obtain. If\nwe or a regulatory authority discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of\nunanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where the product is manufactured, a regulatory\nauthority may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or\nwithdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. In addition, failure to comply with FDA\nand other comparable foreign regulatory requirements may subject our company to administrative or judicially\nimposed sanctions, including:\n• delays in or the rejection of product approvals;\n• restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned\ntrials;\n• restrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;\n• warning or untitled letters;\n• civil and criminal penalties;\n• injunctions;\n• suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n• product seizures, detentions or import bans;\n• voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n• total or partial suspension of production; and\n• imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements.\n40\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize ensifentrine and\ngenerate revenue and could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate\nnegative publicity.\nIn addition, the policies of the FDA and of other regulatory authorities may change and additional government\nregulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We\ncannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or\nadministrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes\nin existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory\ncompliance, we may be subject to enforcement action and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nThe FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the\npromotion of off-label uses which may result in significant liability if we are found to have violated such laws.\nIf ensifentrine is approved for any indication and we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses for\nensifentrine, we may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate\nthe promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, such as our product candidates, if approved.\nIn particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory\nagencies as reflected in the product’s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for a product candidate,\nphysicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If\nwe are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The U.S. federal\ngovernment has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label\nuse and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that\ncompanies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is\nchanged or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of ensifentrine, if approved, we could become\nsubject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn Europe, off-label use is not per se regulated by the EU pharmaceutical legislation and a difference is made\nbetween the strict regulation of medicinal product and the use of medicinal products in medical practice. Off-label\nuse is deferred to national regulation and may vary depending on the EU Member State(s).\nEven if we obtain marketing approval of ensifentrine for any indication in a major pharmaceutical market such\nas the United States or EU, we may never obtain approval or commercialize ensifentrine in other major markets,\nwhich would limit our ability to realize its full market potential.\nIn order to market any products in a country or territory, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying\nregulatory requirements of such country or territory regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one\ncountry may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country\ndoes not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among\ncountries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods.\nSeeking regulatory approvals in all major markets could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and\nmay require additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials which would be costly and time consuming. Regulatory\nrequirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of ensifentrine in\nthose countries. Satisfying these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject\nto unanticipated delays. In addition, our failure to obtain regulatory approval in any country may delay or have\nnegative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries. We currently do not have any product\ncandidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, whether in the EU, the United States or any other international\nmarkets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to\ncomply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our\ntarget market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of ensifentrine will be compromised.\nOur employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, CROs, consultants, vendors and\ncollaboration partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with\nregulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, CROs,\nconsultants, vendors and collaboration partners may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activities.\nMisconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or unauthorized activities that\nviolate: (i) the laws and regulations of the FDA, the EU and other similar regulatory bodies and the EU, including\nthose laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; (ii)\nmanufacturing standards; (iii) federal and state data privacy, security, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and\nregulations in the United States and abroad; or (iv) laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate\n41\nfinancial information and data. Specifically, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry\nare subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and\nother abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting,\nmarketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements.\nActivities subject to these laws could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in\nthe course of clinical trials, creating fraudulent data in our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials or illegal\nmisappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our\nreputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the\nprecautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged\nrisks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a\nfailure to comply with such laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person or government\ncould allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and\nwe are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on\nour business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative\npenalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and\nother U.S. federal healthcare programs or healthcare programs in other jurisdictions, integrity oversight and\nreporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, individual imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual\ndamages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations.\nInterim, “top-line,” or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time\nmay change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could\nresult in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, top-line or preliminary data from our clinical trials, which is\nbased on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are\nsubject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also\nmake assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have\nreceived or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the top-line or preliminary results\nthat we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may\nqualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Top-line or preliminary data also\nremain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from\nthe top-line or preliminary data we previously published. As a result, top-line and preliminary data should be viewed\nwith caution until the final data are available.\nFrom time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Interim data\nfrom clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may\nmaterially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences\nbetween interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations,\nconclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value\nof the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and\nour company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or\nclinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we\ndetermine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure.\nIf the interim, top-line or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory\nauthorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product\ncandidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Healthcare Laws and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nEnacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and\ncommercialize ensifentrine and may affect the prices we may set.\nIn the United States, the EU and other foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be,\na number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect our\nfuture results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S.\nfederal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare. For example, in\nMarch 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education\nReconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changes the way healthcare is\n42\nfinanced by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA, those of greatest importance\nto the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries include the following:\n• an annual, non-deductible fee payable by any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription\ndrugs and biologic agents, which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain\ngovernment healthcare programs;\n• a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-\nsale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap\nperiod, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n• an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate\nProgram to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n• a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are\ncalculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n• extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are\nenrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n• expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid\ncoverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially\nincreasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;\n• a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative\nclinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and\n• establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid\nspending, potentially including prescription drug spending.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA.\nOn June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by\nseveral states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision,\nPresident Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through\nAugust 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive\norder also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that\nlimit access to healthcare.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was\nenacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 has, among other things, led to aggregate reductions of\nMedicare payments to providers, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in\neffect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022,\nunless additional action is taken by Congress. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was\nsigned into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers,\nincluding hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for\nthe government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, the American Rescue\nPlan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, beginning January 1,\n2024. The rebate was previously capped at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price. These laws and any laws\nenacted in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nMoreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For\nexample, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition,\nrecently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for\ntheir marketed products. Most recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was\nsigned into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations\nwith Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under\nMedicare Part B and Medicare Part D continue to penalize price increases that outpace inflation; and replaces the\nPart D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the\nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to implement many of these provisions\nthrough guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. HHS has and will continue to issue and update\nguidance as these programs are implemented. On August 29, 2023, HHS announced the list of the first ten drugs that\nwill be subject to price negotiations, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to\n43\nlegal challenges. The impact of the IRA on the pharmaceutical industry cannot yet be fully determined but, is likely\nto be significant.\nFurther, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to\nsubmit a report within 90 days on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to\ntest new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. In response to the executive order,\non February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the CMS Innovation Center\nwhich will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility and improve quality of care.\nIt is unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future.\nWe expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could\nlimit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result\nin reduced demand for ensifentrine or additional pricing pressures.\nIndividual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing\nregulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient\nreimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and\ntransparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk\npurchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could\nharm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare\nauthorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical\nproducts and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could\nreduce the ultimate demand for ensifentrine or put pressure on our product pricing.\nIn the EU, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably\ncommercialize ensifentrine, if approved. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures,\nlegislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or\nobstacles that may increase our operating costs. The delivery of health care in the EU, including the establishment\nand operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for\nnational, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities\nand approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In\ngeneral, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU member states have resulted in restrictions on the\npricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing EU and\nnational regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing\napproval of ensifentrine, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to commercialize\nensifentrine, if approved. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly\nby country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.\nOn December 13, 2021, Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment (“HTA”) amending Directive\n2011/24/EU, was adopted. While the Regulation entered into force in January 2022, it will only begin to apply from\nJanuary 2025 onwards, with preparatory and implementation-related steps to take place in the interim. Once\napplicable, it will have a phased implementation depending on the concerned products.\nThe Regulation intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including\nnew medicinal products, and provide the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these\nareas. It will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU,\nworking together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with\nthe highest potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from\nHTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and\ncontinuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for\nassessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing\nand reimbursement.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or\nadministrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we or our collaborators are slow or unable to adapt to\nchanges in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or our collaborators are\nnot able to maintain regulatory compliance, ensifentrine may lose any regulatory approval that may have been\nobtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur business operations and current and future relationships with investigators, healthcare professionals,\nconsultants, third-party payors and customers will be subject to applicable healthcare regulatory laws, which\ncould expose us to penalties.\n44\nOur business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals,\nconsultants, third-party payors and customers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other\nhealthcare laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships\nthrough which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute ensifentrine, if\napproved. Such laws include:\n• the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly\nand willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or\ncertain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for,\neither the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility,\nitem or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under U.S. federal and state healthcare\nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the\nstatute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n• the U.S. federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which,\namong other things, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam\nactions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. federal\ngovernment, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to\nbe made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a\nfalse statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. In\naddition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the\nU.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n• the U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes\ncriminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute,\na scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or\ncovering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or\npayment for, healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person\nor entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have\ncommitted a violation;\n• the FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical\ndevices;\n• the U.S. federal legislation commonly referred to as Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the\nACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and\nmedical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program\nto report annually to the government information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to\nphysicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-\nphysician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse\nanesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse-midwives), and teaching hospitals, as well as\nownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family\nmembers;\n• analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to\nour business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and\nclaims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers;\nstate laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary\ncompliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or\notherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and\nstate laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing\ninformation, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare\nprofessionals and entities; and\n• in the EU, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and health care professionals and health care\norganizations, are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and\nphysicians’ codes of professional conduct both at EU level and in the individual EU member states. The\nprovision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation,\nendorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of pharmaceutical products is prohibited in the EU. Relationships\nwith healthcare professionals and associations are subject to stringent anti-gift statutes and anti-bribery laws, the\nscope of which differs across the EU. In addition, national “Sunshine Acts” may require pharmaceutical\ncompanies to report/publish transfers of value provided to health care professionals and associations on a\n45\nregular (e.g. annual) basis. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public\nreprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.\nEnsuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare\nlaws and regulations involves substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our\nbusiness practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving\napplicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of\nany of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be\nsubject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from\nU.S. government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, or similar programs in other\ncountries or jurisdictions, a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-\ncompliance with these laws, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm,\ndiminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers\nor entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be\nsubject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare\nprograms and imprisonment, which could affect our ability to operate our business. Further, defending against any\nsuch actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we\nare successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nActual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations,\nstandards and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are or may become subject to numerous state,\nfederal and foreign laws, requirements and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and\nsecurity of personal information, such as information that we may collect in connection with clinical trials.\nImplementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we\ncannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, standards, or perception of their requirements may have on\nour business. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our ability to operate in certain\njurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more\nonerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with\nthese laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure\nby us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, our internal policies and procedures or our\ncontracts governing our processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, government\ninvestigations and enforcement actions, claims by third parties and damage to our reputation, any of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial condition.\nAs our operations and business grow, we may become subject to or affected by new or additional data protection\nlaws and regulations and face increased scrutiny or attention from regulatory authorities. In the United States,\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and\nregulations implemented thereunder, or collectively HIPAA, imposes, among other things, certain standards relating\nto the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. Most\nhealthcare providers, including research institutions from which we obtain patient health information, are subject to\nprivacy and security regulations promulgated under HIPAA. We do not believe that we are currently acting as a\ncovered entity or business associate under HIPAA and thus are not directly subject to its requirements or penalties.\nHowever, depending on the facts and circumstances, we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly\nreceive individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered healthcare provider or research\ninstitution that has not satisfied HIPAA’s requirements for disclosure of individually identifiable health information.\nCertain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more\nstringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other\ngovernmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and\nstrategic partners. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, (“CCPA”), which went\ninto effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates data privacy obligations for covered\ncompanies and provides privacy rights to California consumers, including rights to access and delete their\ninformation, to opt out of certain information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal\ninformation is used. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data\nbreaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited\nexceptions for health-related information, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information\ndepending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) generally went into effect on\nJanuary 1, 2023 and significantly amends the CCPA. It imposes additional data protection obligations on covered\nbusinesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for\n46\nhigher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection\nagency authorized to issue substantive regulations and will likely result in increased privacy and information\nsecurity enforcement. Additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required.\nSimilar laws have passed in other states and are continuing to be proposed at the state and federal level, reflecting a\ntrend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The enactment of such laws could have\npotentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. In the event that we are subject to or\naffected by HIPAA, the CCPA, the CPRA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from\nfailure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are also subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security in the EU and the EEA,\nincluding the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR went into effect in May 2018 and imposes\nstrict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. The GDPR imposes strict\nobligations on the ability to process health-related and other personal data of individuals within the EEA, including\nin relation to use, collection, analysis, and transfer (including cross-border transfer) of such personal data.\nCompanies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust\nregulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million\nor 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. In addition to fines, a\nbreach of the GDPR may result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our data\nprocessing activities, enforcement notices, assessment notices (for a compulsory audit) and/ or civil claims\n(including class actions). Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the\nGDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the\nUnited States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EEA and the United States\nremains uncertain. Case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) states that reliance on the\nstandard contractual clauses—a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate\npersonal data transfer mechanism—alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that transfers\nmust be assessed on a case-by-case basis. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted its Adequacy\nDecision in relation to the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”), rendering the DPF effective as a GDPR\ntransfer mechanism to U.S. entities self-certified under the DPF, rendering the DPF effective as a GDPR transfer\nmechanism to U.S. entities self-certified under the DPF. We expect the existing legal complexity and uncertainty\nregarding international personal data transfers to continue. In particular, we expect the DPF Adequacy Decision to\nbe challenged and international transfers to the United States and to other jurisdictions more generally to continue to\nbe subject to enhanced scrutiny by regulators. As a result, we may have to make certain operational changes and we\nwill have to implement revised standard contractual clauses and other relevant documentation for existing data\ntransfers within required time frames.\nRelatedly, since the beginning of 2021, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EEA and the\nEuropean Union, and the expiry of the transition period, companies have had to comply with both the GDPR and the\nGDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to\nthe greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. On October 12, 2023, the U.K. Extension to the DPF came\ninto effect (as approved by the U.K. Government), as a data transfer mechanism from the U.K. to U.S. entities self-\ncertified under the DPF. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject\nto additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.\nCompliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous\nobligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability\nto operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure by us or our collaborators and third-party providers to comply with\napplicable data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include\ncivil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating\nresults and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain\ninformation, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may contractually limit our ability to use\nand disclose such information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights, failed to comply with data\nprotection laws or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time\nconsuming to defend, could result in adverse publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe increasing focus on environmental sustainability and social initiatives could increase our costs, harm our\nreputation and adversely impact our financial results.\nThere has been increasing public focus by investors, environmental activists, the media and governmental and\nnongovernmental organizations on a variety of environmental, social and other sustainability matters. We may\nexperience pressure to make commitments relating to sustainability matters that affect us, including the design and\n47\nimplementation of specific risk mitigation strategic initiatives relating to sustainability. If we are not effective in\naddressing environmental, social and other sustainability matters affecting our business, or setting and meeting\nrelevant sustainability goals, our reputation and financial results may suffer. In addition, we may experience\nincreased costs in order to execute upon our sustainability goals and measure achievement of those goals, which\ncould have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, this emphasis on environmental, social and other sustainability matters has resulted and may result in the\nadoption of new laws and regulations, including new reporting requirements. If we fail to comply with new laws,\nregulations or reporting requirements, our reputation and business could be adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and we may become exposed to liability\nand substantial expenses in connection with environmental compliance or remediation activities.\nOur sub-contracted operations, including our research, development, testing and manufacturing activities, are subject\nto numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other\nthings, the controlled use, handling, release and disposal of and the maintenance of a registry for, hazardous\nmaterials and biological materials, such as chemical solvents, human cells, carcinogenic compounds, mutagenic\ncompounds and compounds that have a toxic effect on reproduction, laboratory procedures and exposure to blood-\nborne pathogens. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could incur significant costs associated\nwith civil or criminal fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nAs with other companies engaged in activities similar to ours, we face a risk of environmental liability inherent in\nour current and historical activities, including liability relating to releases of or exposure to hazardous or biological\nmaterials. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are becoming more stringent. We may be required\nto incur substantial expenses in connection with future environmental compliance or remediation activities, in which\ncase, our production and development efforts may be interrupted or delayed.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other\nlaws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal\npenalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or Bribery Act, the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do\nbusiness and may do business in the future. The Bribery Act, FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us, our\nofficers and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to\ngovernment officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We may in\nthe future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and we may\nparticipate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability\nunder the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect\nof future regulatory requirements to which any of our international operations might be subject or the manner in\nwhich existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe also are subject to other laws and regulations governing any international operations, including regulations\nadministered by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, and authorities in the EU, including\napplicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and\ncurrency exchange regulations, or, collectively, the Trade Control laws. In particular, we engaged a number of\nclinical trial sites in Russia in connection with our Phase 3 ENHANCE clinical program and, with the ongoing\nconflict between Russia and Ukraine, and resulting sanctions imposed by the United States and other governments,\nthere is an increased risk that our ability to pay clinical sites or conduct clinical trials in Russia, may be impacted.\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-\ncorruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If\nwe are not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we\nmay be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures and legal\nexpenses. Any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or\nTrade Control laws by U.K., U.S. or other authorities, even if it is ultimately determined that we did not violate such\nlaws, could be costly and time consuming, require significant personnel resources and harm our reputation.\nWe will seek to build and continuously improve our systems of internal controls and to remedy any weaknesses\nidentified. There can be no assurance, however, that the policies and procedures will be followed at all times or\neffectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable laws by one or more of our employees, consultants, agents\nor collaborators and, as a result, we could be subject to fines, penalties or prosecution.\n48\nRisks Related to Commercialization\nWe operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry, which may result in others discovering,\ndeveloping or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid\ntechnological change. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to discover, develop and obtain marketing\napproval for new products on a cost-effective basis and to market them successfully. If ensifentrine is approved for\nany indication, we will face intense competition from a variety of businesses, including large, fully integrated\npharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biopharmaceutical companies, academic\ninstitutions, government agencies and other private and public research institutions in Europe, the U.S. and other\njurisdictions. These organizations may have significantly greater resources than we do and conduct similar research,\nseek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and\nmarketing of products that may compete with ensifentrine.\nGiven the number of products already on the market to treat COPD, asthma, CF and NCFBE, we expect to face\nintense competition if ensifentrine is approved for these indications. Companies including GlaxoSmithKline,\nAstraZeneca, Novartis, Vertex, Viatris, Theravance, Gilead and Genentech currently have treatments on the market\nfor COPD, CF and asthma, and we anticipate that new companies will enter these markets in the future. While no\ntreatments for NCFBE currently have marketing approval in the U.S. or EU, there are products in late-stage clinical\ndevelopment that could be approved in the future. If we successfully develop and commercialize ensifentrine for any\nindication, it will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. The\nhighly competitive nature of, and rapid technological changes in, the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical\nindustries could render ensifentrine obsolete, less competitive or uneconomical. Our competitors may, among other\nthings:\n• have significantly greater name recognition, financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical\nand human resources than we do, and future mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical and\npharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors;\n• develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, more convenient or easier to\nadminister, or have fewer or less severe side effects;\n• obtain quicker regulatory approval;\n• establish superior proprietary positions covering our products and technologies;\n• implement more effective approaches to sales, marketing and distribution; or\n• form more advantageous strategic alliances.\nSmaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through\ncollaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting\nand retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration\nfor clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. In addition,\nany collaborators we may have may decide to market and sell products that compete with ensifentrine. Our\ncommercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that\nare more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than\nensifentrine. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more\nrapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing or strengthening\ntheir market position before we are able to enter the market.\nThe successful commercialization of ensifentrine will depend in part on the extent to which governmental\nauthorities and health insurers establish adequate coverage, reimbursement levels and pricing policies for\nensifentrine. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for ensifentrine, if approved,\ncould limit our ability to market ensifentrine and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by governmental healthcare programs such as\nMedicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able\nto afford prescription medications such as ensifentrine, assuming approval. Our ability to achieve acceptable levels\nof coverage and reimbursement by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will\nhave an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize ensifentrine. Assuming we obtain coverage for\nensifentrine by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require\n49\nco-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Moreover, for drugs and biologics administered under the\nsupervision of a physician, obtaining appropriate documentation for usage may be difficult because of the higher\nprices often associated with such products. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the United States,\nthe EU or elsewhere will be available for ensifentrine or any product that we may develop, and any reimbursement\nthat may become available may be decreased or eliminated in the future.\nThird-party payors increasingly are challenging prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many\nthird-party payors may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement for particular drugs when an equivalent\ngeneric drug or a less expensive therapy is available. It is possible that a third-party payor may consider ensifentrine\nas substitutable and only offer to reimburse patients for the less expensive product. Even if we show improved\nefficacy or improved convenience of administration with ensifentrine, pricing of existing drugs may limit the\namount we will be able to charge for ensifentrine. These payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of a\ngiven product or establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable us to\nrealize an appropriate return on our investment in ensifentrine. If reimbursement is not available or is available only\nat limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize ensifentrine, and may not be able to obtain a\nsatisfactory financial return on ensifentrine.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In\nthe United States, third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid\nprograms, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered. The\nMedicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental\npayors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. Some third-party payors may\nrequire pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse\nhealthcare providers who use such therapies. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide\nwith respect to the coverage and reimbursement for ensifentrine.\nObtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time consuming and costly. No uniform policy for coverage and\nreimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and\nreimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination\nprocess is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for\nthe use of ensifentrine to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be\napplied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement\nchange frequently, in some cases at short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are\nlikely. Specifically, we believe that ensifentrine will be reimbursed under a medical benefit through either Medicare\nPart B or Medicare Advantage programs, and changes within how products are reimbursed under these programs\ncould occur and those changes may affect the overall coverage of ensifentrine in the future.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls\nand other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and\nother countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of ensifentrine. In many countries, the\nprices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other\ncountries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products, but monitor and control company profits.\nAdditional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to\ncharge for ensifentrine. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for ensifentrine may\nbe reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue\nand profits.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or\nreduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for\nnewly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for ensifentrine. We\nexpect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of ensifentrine due to the trend toward managed\nhealthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The\ndownward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other\ntreatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new\nproducts.\nIn addition, even if a pharmaceutical product obtains a marketing authorization in the EU, there can be no assurance\nthat reimbursement for such product will be secured on a timely basis or at all.\nEnsifentrine may not gain market acceptance, in which case our ability to generate product revenues will be\ncompromised.\n50\nEven if the FDA or any other regulatory authority approves the marketing of ensifentrine, whether developed on our\nown or with a collaborator, physicians, healthcare providers, patients or the medical community may not accept or\nuse ensifentrine. If ensifentrine does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant\nproduct revenues or any profits from operations. The degree of market acceptance of ensifentrine will depend on a\nvariety of factors, including:\n• the timing of market introduction;\n• the number and clinical profile of competing products;\n• the clinical indications for which ensifentrine is approved;\n• our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;\n• the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n• relative convenience, frequency, and ease of administration;\n• cost effectiveness;\n• marketing, sales, and distribution support;\n• availability of adequate coverage, reimbursement and adequate payment from health maintenance organizations\nand other insurers, both public and private; and\n• other potential advantages over alternative treatment methods.\nIf ensifentrine fails to gain market acceptance, this will adversely impact our ability to generate revenues. Even if\nensifentrine achieves market acceptance, the market may prove not to be large enough to allow us to generate\nsignificant revenues.\nWe are currently developing our commercial capabilities and infrastructure, including sales, marketing,\noperations, distribution, and reimbursement infrastructure. If we are not successful in developing commercial\ncapabilities and infrastructure, including sales, marketing, operations, distribution and reimbursement\ncapabilities on our own or through contracting third parties or entering into collaborations, we may not be\nsuccessful in commercializing ensifentrine.\nWe are developing sales, marketing, and operations, distribution and reimbursement capabilities and infrastructure\nand we have not previously marketed, sold or distributed pharmaceutical products. The establishment of commercial\ncapabilities and infrastructure, including sales, marketing, operations, distribution, and reimbursement with technical\nexpertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize ensifentrine, is expensive and time consuming.\nSome or all of these costs are incurred in advance of any approval of ensifentrine. In addition, we may not be able to\nhire a sales force that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we intend to target.\nAny failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities on our own or\nthrough collaborations would adversely impact the commercialization of ensifentrine.\nWe are contracting third parties to perform certain services to support our sales, marketing, warehousing,\ndistribution and reimbursement activities. To the extent that any of these third parties fail to perform their services in\ncompliance with their obligations to us or other parties, we may not be successful in commercializing ensifentrine or\nour future product revenues may be adversely impacted.\nTo the extent that we enter into collaboration agreements with respect to marketing, sales or distribution, our product\nrevenue may be lower than if we directly marketed or sold ensifentrine, if approved. In addition, any revenue we\nreceive will depend in whole or in part upon the efforts of these third-party collaborators, which may not be\nsuccessful and are generally not within our control. If we are unable to enter into these arrangements on acceptable\nterms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize ensifentrine. If we are not successful in\ncommercializing ensifentrine, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future\nproduct revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties, including independent clinical investigators and CROs,\nto conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their\ncontractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or\ncommercialize ensifentrine and our business could be substantially harmed.\n51\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third parties, including independent clinical investigators and\nCROs, to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and to monitor and manage data for our ongoing pre-\nclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials,\nand control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our\nstudies and trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific\nstandards, and our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our\nthird-party contractors and CROs are required to comply with GCP requirements, which are regulations and\nguidelines enforced by the FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical\ndevelopment. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors,\nprincipal investigators and trial sites. If we fail to exercise adequate oversight over any of our CROs or if we or any\nof our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may\nbe deemed unreliable and the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform\nadditional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot provide assurance that upon a\nregulatory inspection of us or our CROs or other third parties performing services in connection with our clinical\ntrials, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In\naddition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under applicable cGMP and similar foreign\nregulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay\nthe regulatory approval process.\nFurther, these investigators and CROs are not our employees and we will not be able to control, other than by\ncontract, the amount of resources, including time, which they devote to ensifentrine and clinical trials. If\nindependent investigators or CROs fail to devote sufficient resources to the development of ensifentrine, or if their\nperformance is substandard, it may delay or compromise the prospects for approval and commercialization of\nensifentrine. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information\nto these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated.\nOur existing and future CROs have or may have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an\nuncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements\nwith us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants\nsuch termination, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements\nwith alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding CROs involves additional\ncost and requires management’s time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO\ncommences work. As a result, delays could occur, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired\nclinical development timelines. In addition, if our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or\nobligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised\ndue to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials\nmay be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize,\nensifentrine. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for ensifentrine would be harmed,\nour costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nThe collaboration and license agreement with Nuance Pharma is important to our business. If Nuance Pharma is\nunable to develop and commercialize products containing ensifentrine in Greater China, if we or Nuance\nPharma fail to adequately perform under the Nuance Agreement, or if we or Nuance Pharma terminate the\nNuance Agreement, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Nuance Pharma effective June 9, 2021 (the “Nuance\nAgreement”) under which we granted Nuance Pharma the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products\ncontaining ensifentrine (the “Nuance Licensed Products”) in Greater China (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and\nMacau).\nThe Nuance Agreement will continue on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction and product-by-product basis until the\nexpiration of royalty payment obligations with respect to such product in such jurisdiction unless earlier terminated\nby the parties. Either party may terminate the Nuance Agreement for an uncured material breach or bankruptcy of\nthe other party. Nuance Pharma may also terminate the Nuance Agreement at will upon 90 days' prior written notice.\nTermination of the Nuance Agreement could cause significant setbacks in our ability to develop and commercialize\nthe Nuance Licensed Products in Greater China. Any suitable alternative collaboration or license agreement would\ntake considerable time to negotiate and could also be on less favorable terms to us. In addition, under the Nuance\nAgreement, Nuance Pharma agreed to assume all costs related to clinical development and commercialization of the\nNuance Licensed Products in Greater China. If the Nuance Agreement were to be terminated, and whether or not we\n52\nidentify another suitable collaborator, we may need to seek additional financing to support the clinical development\nand commercialization of the Nuance Licensed Products in Greater China, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nUnder the Nuance Agreement, we are dependent upon Nuance Pharma to successfully develop and commercialize\nNuance Licensed Products. Although we have formed a joint steering committee with Nuance Pharma to oversee\nand coordinate the overall conduct of the clinical development and commercialization of the Nuance Licensed\nProducts in Greater China, we do not control all aspects of Nuance Pharma’s development and commercialization or\nthe resources it allocates to the development of the Nuance Licensed Products identified under the Nuance\nAgreement. Our interests and Nuance Pharma’s interests may differ or conflict from time to time, or we may\ndisagree with Nuance Pharma’s level of effort or resource allocation. Nuance Pharma may internally prioritize\nprograms under development within the collaboration differently than we would, or it may not allocate sufficient\nresources to effectively or optimally develop or commercialize the Nuance Licensed Products. If these events were\nto occur, our ability to receive revenue from the commercialization of the Nuance Licensed Products would be\nreduced, and our business would be adversely affected. In addition, under the Nuance Agreement, we have an\nobligation to supply Nuance Pharma with the ensifentrine drug product for their development and commercialization\nactivities in Greater China and if our supply price is too high, the price at which Nuance Pharma sells the drug\nproduct in Greater China may not be competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on Nuance Pharma’s\nability to successfully commercialize Nuance Licensed Products and the returns that we generate under the Nuance\nAgreement. Furthermore, the safety and/or efficacy data from Nuance Pharma’s clinical development activities\ncould for various reasons differ from our data and could potentially impact our clinical development and\ncommercialization activities, including our ability to obtain regulatory approval of ensifentrine in the United States\nand other countries.\nIf we fail to enter into new strategic relationships for ensifentrine, our business, research and development and\ncommercialization prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur development program for ensifentrine and the potential commercialization of ensifentrine will require\nsubstantial additional cash to fund expenses. Therefore, we may decide to enter into collaborations with\npharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies for the development and potential commercialization of\nensifentrine. For example, we may seek a collaborator for development of our DPI or pMDI formulation of\nensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD and potentially asthma and other respiratory diseases.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time\nconsuming to negotiate and document. We may also be restricted under existing and future collaboration agreements\nfrom entering into agreements on certain terms with other potential collaborators. We may not be able to negotiate\ncollaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. If that were to occur, we may have to curtail the development of\nensifentrine, reduce or delay its development program, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of\nour sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization\nactivities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization\nactivities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable\nterms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring ensifentrine to market and generate\nproduct revenue. If we do enter into a collaboration agreement, we could be subject to the following risks, among\nothers, any of which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize ensifentrine:\n• we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that the collaborator devotes to the\ndevelopment of ensifentrine;\n• the collaborator may experience financial difficulties;\n• we may be required to relinquish important rights such as marketing, distribution and intellectual property\nrights;\n• a collaborator could move forward with a competing product developed either independently or in collaboration\nwith third parties, including our competitors;\n• safety and/or efficacy data from a collaborator’s clinical development activities may conflict with our data and\ncould potentially impact our global clinical development and commercialization activities;\n• a collaborator may unlawfully use or disclose confidential information and materials in breach of confidentiality\nobligations to us;\n• business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator’s business strategy may adversely affect our\nwillingness to complete our obligations under any arrangement;\n53\n• we or a collaborator could fail to adequately perform our obligations under the agreement and/or the agreement\ncould fall into dispute;\n• we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce patents covering ensifentrine, or relating to the terms of\nour collaborations, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful; or\n• the collaboration may not provide sufficient funds to be profitable for us after we fulfill our payment liabilities\nunder our agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ligand, which acquired Vernalis Development\nLimited, or Vernalis, in October 2018.\nWe currently rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for production of the active pharmaceutical\ningredient ensifentrine and its derived formulated products. Our dependence on these third parties may impair\nthe advancement of our research and development programs and the development of ensifentrine. Moreover, we\nintend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of ensifentrine, if approved, and commercialization\ncould be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain the necessary approvals from\nthe FDA or comparable regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of product in a timely\nmanner or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices or fail to otherwise complete their duties in\ncompliance with their obligations to us or other parties.\nWe do not own facilities for manufacturing ensifentrine and its derived formulated products. Instead, we rely on and\nexpect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), for the supply of cGMP-\nor GMP-grade clinical trial materials and commercial quantities of ensifentrine and its derived formulated products,\nif approved. While we may contract with other CMOs in the future, we currently have one CMO for the manufacture\nof ensifentrine drug substance and one CMO for each formulation of ensifentrine. The facilities used to manufacture\nensifentrine and its derived formulated products must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be\nconducted after we submit an NDA to the FDA, and by comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approvals\noutside the United States. While we provide sponsor oversight of manufacturing activities, we do not and will not\ndirectly control the manufacturing process of, and are or will be essentially dependent on, our CMOs for compliance\nwith cGMP and similar foreign requirements for the manufacture of ensifentrine and its derived formulated\nproducts. If a CMO cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the regulatory\nrequirements of the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, it will not be able to secure or maintain\nregulatory approval for the manufacture of ensifentrine and its derived formulated products in its manufacturing\nfacilities. In addition, we have little direct control over the ability of a CMO to maintain adequate quality control,\nquality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve\nthese facilities for the manufacture of ensifentrine and its derived formulated products or if it withdraws any such\napproval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would delay our development\nprogram and significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market ensifentrine and its\nderived formulated products, if approved. In addition, any failure to achieve and maintain compliance with these\nlaws, regulations and standards could subject us to the risk that we may have to suspend the manufacture of\nensifentrine and its derived formulated products or that obtained approvals could be revoked. Furthermore, third-\nparty providers may breach existing agreements they have with us because of factors beyond our control. They may\nalso terminate or refuse to renew their agreement because of their own financial difficulties or business priorities, at\na time that is costly or otherwise inconvenient for us. If we were unable to find an adequate replacement or another\nacceptable solution in time, our clinical trials could be delayed or our commercial activities could be harmed. In\naddition, the fact that we are dependent on our suppliers, CMOs and other third parties for the manufacture, storage\nand distribution of ensifentrine and its derived formulated products means that we are subject to the risk that\nensifentrine and its derived formulated products may have manufacturing defects that we have limited ability to\nprevent, detect or control.\nWe rely on and will continue to rely on CMOs to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to\nproduce ensifentrine and its derived formulated products and the inhalation and nebulization devices to deliver\nensifentrine. We do not and will not have any direct control over the process or timing of the acquisition and\ndelivery of these supplies by any CMO or its third-party suppliers, or the quality or quantity of such supplies. These\nsupplies could be interrupted from time to time and, if interrupted, we cannot be certain that alternative supplies\ncould be obtained within a reasonable timeframe, at an acceptable cost or quality, or at all. There are a limited\nnumber of suppliers for the raw materials that we may use to manufacture ensifentrine and for the drug delivery\ndevices (e.g. nebulizers) that we use for clinical trials with ensifentrine, and we will need to assess alternate\nsuppliers to prevent a possible disruption to our clinical trials, and if approved, ultimately to commercial sales.\nAlthough we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have on hand, or will be able to obtain, a\nsufficient supply of ensifentrine to complete the clinical trial, any significant delay in the supply of ensifentrine drug\nproducts, or the raw material components needed to produce, or devices needed to deliver, ensifentrine, for an\n54\nongoing clinical trial due to our CMOs or their third-party suppliers could considerably delay completion of our\nclinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of ensifentrine. If our CMOs, their third-party\nsupplies, or we are unable to purchase these supplies after regulatory approval has been obtained for ensifentrine, the\ncommercial launch of ensifentrine would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our\nability to generate revenues from the sale of ensifentrine. In addition, growth in the costs and expenses of these\nsupplies may impair our ability to cost-effectively manufacture ensifentrine. Additionally, CMOs are experiencing\nlabor constraints which could impact their ability to manufacture and deliver ensifentrine.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on CMOs and third-party suppliers to comply with and respect the proprietary\nrights of others in conducting their contractual obligations for us. If a CMO or third-party suppliers fails to acquire\nthe proper licenses or otherwise infringes third-party proprietary rights in the course of providing services to us, we\nmay have to find alternative CMOs or third-party suppliers, or defend against claims of infringement, either of\nwhich would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, or market ensifentrine and\nany of its derived formulated products, if approved.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe rely on patents and other intellectual property rights to protect ensifentrine, the enforcement, defense and\nmaintenance of which may be challenging and costly. Failure to enforce or protect these rights adequately could\nharm our ability to compete and impair our business.\nOur commercial success depends in part on obtaining and maintaining patents and other forms of intellectual\nproperty rights for ensifentrine, formulations of ensifentrine, polymorphs, salts and analogs of ensifentrine, methods\nused to manufacture ensifentrine, methods for manufacturing of final drug product for different inhalation devices\nsuch as nebulizer, DPI, pMDI, and the methods for treating patients with respiratory diseases using ensifentrine\nalone or in combination with other available products, or on in-licensing such rights. The registrations of the\nassignment of each of these patents and patent applications with the relevant authorities in certain jurisdictions in\nwhich the patent and patent applications are registered have been granted, but there is no assurance that any\nadditional registrations will be effected in a timely manner or at all. Failure to protect or to obtain, maintain or\nextend adequate patent and other intellectual property rights could adversely affect our ability to develop and market\nensifentrine.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we or our licensors, licensees or collaborators\nmay not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in\na timely manner or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we or our licensors, licensees or collaborators will fail\nto identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities\nbefore it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Moreover, depending on the terms of any future in-licenses\nto which we may become a party, in some circumstances we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing\nand prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology in-licensed from third parties.\nTherefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best\ninterests of our business. Further, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our\ncurrent or future licensors’, licensees’ or collaborators’ patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors’\npending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or\nproducts, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies\nand products. The patent examination process may require us or our licensors, licensees or collaborators to narrow\nthe scope of the claims of our or our licensors’, licensees’ or collaborators’ pending and future patent applications,\nwhich may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained. We cannot provide assurance that all of the\npotentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found. If such prior art exists, it\ncan invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do\nsuccessfully issue and even if such patents cover ensifentrine, third parties may initiate an opposition, interference,\nre-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent\noffices, or similar proceedings challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of such patents, which may result in\nthe patent claims being narrowed or invalidated. Our and our licensors’, licensees’ or collaborators’ patent\napplications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless\nand until a patent issues from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology.\nBecause patent applications are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we\ncannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file any patent application related to ensifentrine.\nFurthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications on or before March 15, 2013, the date on which the\nU.S. patent filing system changed from a first-to-invent to a first-to-file standard, an interference proceeding can be\n55\ninitiated by such third parties to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent\nclaims of our applications. If third parties have filed such applications after March 15, 2013, a derivation proceeding\ncan be initiated by such third parties to determine whether our invention was derived from theirs. Even where we\nhave a valid and enforceable patent, we may not be able to exclude others from practicing our invention where the\nother party can show that they used the invention in commerce before our filing date or the other party benefits from\na compulsory license.\nWe may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of\na third-party patent which might adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture and market ensifentrine.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our or our licensors’ patent searches or analyses, including but not limited to the\nidentification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or\nthorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third-party patent and pending application in\nthe United States and abroad that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of ensifentrine in any\njurisdiction. For example, U.S. applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain U.S. applications filed after\nthat date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in\nthe United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is\nclaimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications\ncovering ensifentrine could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent\napplications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could\ncover ensifentrine or the use of ensifentrine. The scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the\nlaw, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent’s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the\nscope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market\nensifentrine. We may incorrectly determine that ensifentrine is not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly\npredict whether a third party’s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the\nexpiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, which may\nnegatively impact our ability to develop and market ensifentrine. Our failure to identify and correctly interpret\nrelevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market ensifentrine.\nIf we fail to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents, we may be subject to infringement claims. We cannot\nguarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims. If we fail in any\nsuch dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from\ncommercializing ensifentrine. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign ensifentrine so that we no longer\ninfringe the third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could\nrequire us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our\nbusiness.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce patents covering ensifentrine, which could be expensive,\ntime consuming and unsuccessful, and issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in\ncourt.\nTo protect our competitive position, we may from time to time need to resort to litigation in order to enforce or\ndefend any patents or other intellectual property rights owned by or licensed to us, or to determine or challenge the\nscope or validity of patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. As enforcement of intellectual\nproperty rights is difficult, unpredictable, time consuming and expensive, we may fail in enforcing our rights — in\nwhich case our competitors may be permitted to use our technology without being required to pay us any license\nfees. In addition, however, litigation involving our patents carries the risk that one or more of our patents will be\nheld invalid (in whole or in part, on a claim-by-claim basis) or held unenforceable. Such an adverse court ruling\ncould allow third parties to commercialize ensifentrine, and then compete directly with us, without payment to us. If\nwe in-license intellectual property rights, our agreements may give our licensors the first right to control claims of\nthird-party infringement, or to defend validity challenges. Therefore, these patents and patent applications may not\nbe enforced or defended in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nIf we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products, the\ndefendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States or\nin Europe, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity\nchallenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty,\nobviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone\nconnected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,\nor USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of\ninvalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for\n56\nexample, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were\nunaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we\nwould lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on ensifentrine. Patents and other intellectual\nproperty rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without\ninfringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property\nlitigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this\ntype of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim\nproceedings or developments. If securities analysts, industry commentators or investors perceive these results to be\nnegative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our ADSs.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the\noutcome of which would be uncertain and could have a negative impact on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability, and the ability of our future collaborators, to develop,\nmanufacture, market and sell our product candidates without alleged or actual infringement, misappropriation or\nother violation of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There have been many lawsuits and other\nproceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical\nindustries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and reexamination proceedings before\nthe USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. The various markets in which we plan to operate are subject to\nfrequent and extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. In addition, many\ncompanies in intellectual property-dependent industries, including the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical\nindustries, have employed intellectual property litigation as a means to gain an advantage over their competitors.\nNumerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist\nin the fields in which we are developing ensifentrine. Some claimants may have substantially greater resources than\nwe do and may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for\nlonger periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties\nand settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand\nand more patents are issued, the risk increases that ensifentrine may be subject to claims of infringement of the\nintellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe may in the future become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding\nintellectual property rights with respect to ensifentrine and any future product candidates, including interference or\nderivation proceedings, post grant review and inter partes review before the USPTO or similar adversarial\nproceedings or litigation in other jurisdictions. Similarly, we or our licensors or collaborators may initiate such\nproceedings or litigation against third parties, for example, to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property\nrights controlled by third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents\nor patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of their merit. There is a risk that third parties may choose to\nengage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patent rights against us. Even if we believe such\nclaims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid,\nenforceable and infringed, and the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize\nsuch product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are\nfinally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our compositions, formulations, or methods of treatment, prevention or\nuse, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable\nproduct candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid or\nunenforceable. Such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, or may be non-exclusive thereby\ngiving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us.\nIf we fail in any such dispute, we may be forced to pay damages, including the possibility of treble damages in a\npatent case if a court finds us to have willfully infringed certain intellectual property rights. We or our licensees may\nbe temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing ensifentrine or from selling, incorporating,\nmanufacturing or using our products in the United States and/or other jurisdictions that use the subject intellectual\nproperty. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign ensifentrine so that we no longer infringe the third-party\nintellectual property rights, which may result in significant cost or delay to us, or which redesign could be\ntechnically infeasible. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert\nsubstantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business.\n57\nIn addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our or our licensors’ or collaborators’ patents and\npatent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or\ncommercialize current or future product candidates.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\nAlthough we are not currently experiencing any claims challenging the inventorship of our patents or ownership of\nour intellectual property, we may in the future be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other\nthird parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. While it is our\npolicy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of\nintellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in\nexecuting such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard\nas our own. For example, the assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment\nagreements may be breached, or we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants\nor others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against\nthese and other claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying\nmonetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use,\nvaluable intellectual property. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in\nsubstantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from\ntheir normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause\nus to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal\nresponsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim\nproceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, such\nperceptions could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our ADSs. Such litigation or proceedings could\nsubstantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may\nnot have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our\ncompetitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because\nof their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent\nlitigation or other proceedings could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our existing and any future intellectual property licenses or loan\nagreements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are party to a license agreement with Ligand, under which we in-license certain intellectual property and were\nassigned certain patents and patent applications related to our business. We may enter into additional license\nagreements in the future. We expect that any future license agreements would impose various diligence, milestone\npayment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. We also entered into the 2024 Term Loan with the Agent\nand the Lenders. The 2024 Term Loan is secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the assets of Verona\nPharma, Inc. and the Company, including intellectual property. We also recently entered into the RIPSA with\nOaktree Fund Administration, LLC, as administrative agent, the RIPSA Purchasers. The RIPSA is secured by a\nsecond-priority lien on certain of our intellectual property. For further description of the 2024 Term Loan and\nRIPSA, see Note 8 - Subsequent Events to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Any uncured, material\nbreach under any of these agreements could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights and other\nintellectual property under these agreements, and could compromise our development and commercialization efforts\nfor ensifentrine or any future product candidates. Under our agreement with Ligand, we may not abandon any of the\nassigned patents or allow any of the assigned patents to lapse without consent from Ligand, which is not to be\nunreasonably delayed or withheld. If we do not obtain such consent in a timely manner or at all and such assigned\npatent rights lapse or are abandoned, our agreement with Ligand may be terminated in its entirety. For example, if\nwe decide for commercial reasons to let an assigned patent lapse in a country of little commercial importance, but\nLigand does not provide consent and such patent rights lapse, we may lose all intellectual property rights covering\nensifentrine in multiple markets. Moreover, our future licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not\nbeen licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or\notherwise violating the licensor’s rights.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining the necessary rights to ensifentrine or obtaining other intellectual\nproperty rights important to our business through acquisitions and in-licenses.\n58\nWe currently own and have in-licensed rights to intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and\nknow-how, relating to ensifentrine, and our success will likely depend on maintaining these rights. Because our\nprograms may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will likely\ndepend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license, maintain or use these proprietary rights. In addition, ensifentrine\nmay require specific formulations to work effectively and the rights to these formulations may be held by others. We\nmay be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other third-party intellectual\nproperty rights that we identify as necessary for ensifentrine. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual\nproperty rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies also are pursuing strategies to\nlicense or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established\ncompanies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical\ndevelopment and commercialization capabilities.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We\nmay also be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on a timely basis, on terms that\nwould allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license to\nintellectual property of interest, we may not be able to secure exclusive rights, in which case others could use the\nsame rights and compete with us. If we are unable to successfully obtain a license to third-party intellectual property\nrights necessary for the development of ensifentrine or a development program on acceptable terms, we may have to\nabandon development of ensifentrine or that development program.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product names, and any failure or delay associated with\nsuch approval may adversely affect our business.\nAny proprietary name we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of\nwhether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the USPTO. The FDA reviews proposed product\nnames, considering both the potential for the name to lead to medical errors due to confusion with other product\nnames and whether the proposed name is overly fanciful, misleadingly implies unique effectiveness or composition,\nor contributes to overstatement of product efficacy, minimization of risk, broadening of product indications or\nunsubstantiated superiority.\nIf the FDA objects to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt an alternative name for our\nproduct candidates. If we adopt an alternative name, we could lose the benefit of any existing trademark applications\nfor such product candidate, and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a\nsuitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third\nparties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in\na timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name\nrecognition in our markets of interest and our competitive position may be adversely affected.\nWe have registered trademarks in some territories and made applications to register the trademarks in other\nterritories for potential trade names for our business and proposed drug products. We may not be able to obtain\ntrademark protection for our trade names in territories that we consider of significant importance to us. If we register\ntrademarks, our trademark applications may be rejected during trademark registration proceedings. Although we will\nbe given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition,\nany of our trademarks or trade names, whether registered or unregistered, may be challenged, opposed, infringed,\ncancelled, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to\nprotect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition by potential\ncollaborators or customers in our markets of interest. Over the long-term, if we are unable to establish name\nrecognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our\nbusiness may be adversely affected. If other entities use trademarks similar to ours in different jurisdictions, or have\nsenior rights to ours, it could interfere with our use of our current trademarks throughout the world.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar non-U.S. legislation for\nextending the term of patents covering ensifentrine and any other product candidates, our ability to compete\neffectively could be impaired.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of\na patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. The issued patents covering the\ncomposition of matter for ensifentrine expired in 2020, and our other issued patents will expire in 2031 to 2041,\nsubject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents. If patents are issued on our pending patent\napplications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2031 to 2044. Various extensions\n59\nmay be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering\nensifentrine are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from\ncompetitive medications, including generic medications. Given the amount of time required for the development,\ntesting and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or\nshortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not\nprovide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of the FDA marketing approval of ensifentrine, one or more of\nour U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent\nTerm Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the EU.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an\napproved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA\nregulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable\ndeadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements.\nMoreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension\nor the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights\nfor that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As\na result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced, possibly materially.\nWe enjoy only limited geographical protection with respect to certain patents and may face difficulties in certain\njurisdictions, which may diminish the value of our intellectual property rights in those jurisdictions.\nWe generally file our first patent application, or priority filing, at the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office.\nInternational applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, are usually filed within 12 months after the\npriority filing. Based on the PCT filing, national and regional patent applications may be filed in additional\njurisdictions where we believe a product candidate may be marketed or manufactured. We have so far not filed for\npatent protection for ensifentrine in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive,\nand our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in\nthe United States. In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before grant. The\ngrant proceeding of each national or regional patent is an independent proceeding which may lead to situations in\nwhich applications might in some jurisdictions be refused by the relevant patent offices, while granted by others. For\nexample, unlike other countries, China has a heightened requirement for patentability, and specifically requires a\ndetailed description of medical uses of a claimed drug. Furthermore, generic drug manufacturers or other\ncompetitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our licensors’ patents, requiring us or our\nlicensors to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. Generic drug manufacturers may\ndevelop, seek approval for and launch generic versions of our products. It is also quite common that depending on\nthe country, the scope of patent protection may vary for the same product candidate or technology.\nCompetitors may use our or our licensors’ or collaborators’ technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained\npatent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories\nwhere we or our licensors or collaborators have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the\nUnited States. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our and our licensors’ or collaborators’\npatents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws or rules and\nregulations in the United States and the EU, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in\nprotecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain\ndeveloping countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property\nprotection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing\nproducts in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign\njurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from\nother aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our\npatent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not\nprevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially\nmeaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate\nto obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. Furthermore,\nwhile we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that\nwe will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product\ncandidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate,\nwhich may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in all of our\n60\nexpected significant foreign markets. If we or our licensors encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise\nprecluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for our business in such\njurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished and we may face additional competition from others in\nthose jurisdictions.\nSome countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to\nthird parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or\ngovernment contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially\ndiminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with\nrespect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property\nrights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive\nadvantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n• Others may be able to make compounds that are the same as or similar to our product candidates but that are not\ncovered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n• The patents of third parties may impair our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates;\n• We or our licensors or any future strategic collaborators might not have been the first to conceive or reduce to\npractice the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have\nexclusively licensed;\n• We or our licensors or any future collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering\ncertain of our inventions;\n• Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies\nwithout infringing our intellectual property rights;\n• It is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n• Issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantage, or\nmay be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n• Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent\nrights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our\nmajor commercial markets;\n• Third parties performing manufacturing or testing for us using our product candidates or technologies could use\nthe intellectual property of others without obtaining a proper license; and\n• We may not develop additional technologies that are patentable.\nChanges in patent laws or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing\nour ability to protect ensifentrine or any future product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property,\nparticularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological\ncomplexity and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time\nconsuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the America Invents Act, or the AIA, which was passed on\nSeptember 16, 2011, resulted in significant changes to the U.S. patent system.\nAn important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a “first-\nto-file” system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed\nby different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO, after that\ndate but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the\ninvention before it was made by the third party. This requires us to be cognizant of the time from invention to filing\nof a patent application, but circumstances could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on our\ninventions.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent\ninfringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This\napplies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard\n61\nin USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent\nclaim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a\nclaim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a\ndistrict court action.\nAccordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not\nhave been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. It is not clear\nwhat, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. However, the AIA and its implementation\ncould increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our or our licensors’ or collaboration\npartners’ patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our licensors’ or collaboration partners’ issued\npatents.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years either narrowing the scope of\npatent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In\naddition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events\nhas created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by Congress, the\nfederal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that\ncould weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in\nthe future. Similarly, the complexity and uncertainty of European patent laws has also increased in recent years. In\naddition, the European patent system is relatively stringent in the type of amendments that are allowed during\nprosecution. Complying with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to obtain new patents in the future\nthat may be important for our business.\nFinally, a Unitary Patent and Unified Patent Court (UPC) system were implemented in Europe on June 1, 2023. This\nnew regime may present uncertainties for our ability to protect and enforce our patent rights against competitors in\nEurope. Under the UPC, all European patents, including those issued prior to ratification of the European Patent\nPackage, by default automatically fall under the jurisdiction of the UPC. The UPC provides our competitors with a\nnew forum to centrally revoke our European patents, and allows for the possibility of a competitor to obtain pan-\nEuropean injunctions. It will be several years before we will understand the scope of patent rights that will be\nrecognized and the strength of patent remedies that will be provided by the UPC. Under the EU Patent Package, we\nwill have the right to opt our patents out of the UPC over the first seven years of the court’s existence, but doing so\nmay preclude us from realizing the benefits of the new unified court.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and\nprotect other proprietary information.\nWe consider proprietary trade secrets and confidential know-how and unpatented know-how to be important to our\nbusiness. We may rely on trade secrets or confidential know-how to protect our technology, especially where patent\nprotection is believed to be of limited value. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to\nmaintain as confidential.\nTo protect this type of information against disclosure or appropriation by competitors, our policy is to require our\nemployees, consultants, contractors and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. We also seek to\npreserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security\nof our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Monitoring\nunauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our\nproprietary technologies will be effective. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other proprietary and\nconfidential information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nHowever, current or former employees, consultants, contractors and advisors may unintentionally or willfully\ndisclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate\nremedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party\nobtained illegally and is using trade secrets and/or confidential know-how is expensive, time consuming and\nunpredictable. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nFurthermore, if a competitor lawfully obtained or independently developed any of our trade secrets, we would have\nno right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm\nour competitive position. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we\nmay have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret.\nFailure to obtain or maintain trade secrets and confidential know-how trade protection could adversely affect our\ncompetitive position. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary\ninformation and may even apply for patent protection in respect of the same. If successful in obtaining such patent\nprotection, our competitors could limit our use of our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how.\n62\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their\nintellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at universities or at other\nbiopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees\nexecuted proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous\nemployment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of\nothers in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed\nconfidential information or intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such\nemployee’s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose\nvaluable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be\nawarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our\ntechnology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we\nsuccessfully prosecute or defend against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distract\nmanagement.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document\nsubmission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent\nprotection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent\nagencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent\nagencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions\nduring the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late\nfee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result\nin abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in\nthe relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent\napplication include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and\nfailure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors or collaboration partners fail to\nmaintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter\nthe market, which would hurt our competitive position and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize\nany product candidate.\nRisks related to Information Technology\nOur information technology systems, and those of our manufacturers, suppliers and other third parties that we\nuse to perform services for us or otherwise collaborate with, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could\ndistract our operations and cause delays in our research and development and commercialization activities, and\nmay adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our manufacturers, suppliers and third parties that we use to perform\nservices for us or otherwise collaborate with, collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, clinical\ntrial data, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information (collectively, “Confidential\nInformation”) of our clinical trial subjects and employees, in our and third-party data centers and on our and third-\nparty networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of Confidential Information is critical to our\noperations. Our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls,\nservers, leased lines and connection to the Internet, and that of our manufacturers, suppliers and other third parties\nthat we use to perform services for us or otherwise collaborate with, face the risk of systemic failure that could\ndisrupt our operations. A significant disruption in the availability of these information technology and other internal\ninfrastructure systems could cause interruptions in our collaborations and delays in our research and development\nand commercialization activities.\nFurther, our information technology systems and those of our third-party service providers, strategic partners and\nother contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage, attack or interruption from computer viruses, malware\n(e.g ransomware), misconfigurations, “bugs” or other vulnerabilities, natural disasters, terrorism, war,\ntelecommunication and electrical failures, hacking, cyberattacks, phishing attacks and other social engineering\nschemes, malicious code, employee theft or misuse, human error, fraud, denial or degradation of service attacks,\nsophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors or unauthorized access or use by persons inside our\norganization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Attacks upon information technology\n63\nsystems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted\nby sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. As a result of a\ncontinued hybrid working environment, we may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on\ninternet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional\nopportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain\nunauthorized access to, or to sabotage or disrupt, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until\nlaunched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative\nmeasures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. Even if\nidentified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers\nincreasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove\nor obfuscate forensic evidence. There can also be no assurance that our and our manufacturers’, suppliers’ and other\ncritical third parties’ cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including policies, controls or\nprocedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems, networks and\nConfidential Information.\nDespite security measures that we and our critical third parties (e.g., collaborators) implement, our information\ntechnology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or internal bad actors, breaches due to human\nerror, technical vulnerabilities, malfeasance or other disruptions. We and certain of our service providers are from\ntime to time subject to cyberattacks and security incidents. Although to our knowledge we have not experienced any\nsignificant security breach to date, any such breach could compromise our networks and the Confidential\nInformation stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other\nloss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of\npersonal data, regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in\nus and our ability to conduct clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates, which could adversely affect\nour reputation and delay clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates. Any adverse impact\nto the availability, integrity or confidentiality of our or third-party systems or Confidential Information can result in\nlegal claims or proceedings (such as class actions), regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, fines and\npenalties, negative reputational impacts that cause us to lose existing or future customers, and/or significant incident\nresponse, system restoration or remediation and future compliance costs. Any losses, costs or liabilities may not be\ncovered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, any or all applicable insurance policies.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future growth and ability to compete depends on our ability to retain our key personnel and recruit\nadditional qualified personnel.\nOur success depends upon the contributions of our key management, scientific and technical personnel, many of\nwhom have been instrumental for us and have substantial experience with ensifentrine and related technologies. Our\nkey management individuals include our chief executive officer, David Zaccardelli, our chief financial officer, Mark\nHahn, our general counsel, Andrew Fisher, our chief medical officer, Kathleen Rickard, our senior vice president,\nregulatory affairs, Caroline Diaz, our chief commercial officer, Christopher Martin, and our chief development\nofficer, Tara Rheault. The loss of key personnel could delay our commercialization and research and development\nactivities. In addition, the competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical field is\nintense, and our future success depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled scientific,\ntechnical and managerial employees. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public\nand private research institutions and other organizations. If our recruitment and retention efforts are unsuccessful in\nthe future, it may be difficult for us to achieve our product candidate development objectives, raise additional capital\nand implement our business strategy.\nWe expect to expand our development, regulatory, commercial, sales, marketing, reimbursement and distribution\ncapabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our\noperations.\nWe expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations,\nparticularly in the areas of commercial operations and sales, marketing, reimbursement and distribution. To manage\nour anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial\nsystems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited\nfinancial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such\nanticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train\nadditional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our\n64\nmanagement and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our\nbusiness plans or disrupt our operations.\nRisks Related to Our ADSs\nCertain of our shareholders, members of our board of directors, and senior management who own our ordinary\nshares (including ordinary shares represented by ADSs) may be able to exercise significant control over us.\nDepending on the level of attendance at our general meetings of shareholders, these shareholders either alone or\nvoting together as a group may be in a position to determine or significantly influence the outcome of decisions\ntaken at any such general meeting. Any shareholder or group of shareholders controlling more than 50% of the share\ncapital present and voting at our general meetings of shareholders may control any shareholder resolution requiring a\nsimple majority, including the appointment of board members, certain decisions relating to our capital structure, and\nthe approval of certain significant corporate transactions. Among other consequences, this concentration of\nownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might therefore negatively affect\nthe market price of our ADSs and ordinary shares.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ADSs or ordinary shares in the foreseeable\nfuture, capital appreciation, if any, will be our ADS holders’ and shareholders’ sole source of gains and they may\nnever receive a return on their investment.\nUnder current English law, a company’s accumulated realized profits must exceed its accumulated realized losses\n(on a non-consolidated basis) before dividends can be paid. Therefore, we must have distributable profits before\nissuing a dividend. We have not paid dividends in the past on our ordinary shares. We intend to retain earnings, if\nany, for use in our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result,\ncapital appreciation, if any, on our ADSs or ordinary shares will be our ADS holders’ and shareholders’ sole source\nof gain for the foreseeable future, and they will suffer a loss on their investment if they are unable to sell their ADSs\nor ordinary shares at or above the price at which they were purchased. Investors seeking cash dividends should not\npurchase our ADSs or ordinary shares.\nHolders of our ADSs may not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not\nreceive voting materials in time to be able to exercise their right to vote.\nHolders of our ADSs are not able to exercise voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares evidenced by our ADSs\non an individual basis. Holders of our ADSs have appointed a depositary as their representative to exercise the\nvoting rights attaching to the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Holders of our ADSs may not receive\nvoting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote, and it is possible that they, or persons who hold their\nADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote.\nFurthermore, the depositary will not be liable for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, for the manner in\nwhich any vote is cast or for the effect of any such vote. As a result, holders of our ADSs may not be able to\nexercise voting rights and may lack recourse if their ADSs are not voted as requested. In addition, holders of our\nADSs will not be able to call a shareholders’ meeting.\nHolders of our ADSs may not receive distributions on our ordinary shares represented by our ADSs or any value\nfor them if it is illegal or impractical to make them available to them.\nThe depositary for our ADSs has agreed to pay to holders of our ADSs the cash dividends or other distributions it or\nthe custodian receives on our ordinary shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses.\nHolders of our ADSs will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of our ordinary shares their ADSs\nrepresent. However, in accordance with the limitations set forth in the deposit agreement entered into with the\ndepositary, it may be unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to holders of our ADSs. We have no\nobligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of our ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else to\nholders of our ADSs. This means that holders of our ADSs may not receive the distributions we make on our\nordinary shares or any value from them if it is unlawful or impractical to make the distributions available to them.\nThese restrictions may have a material adverse effect on the value of our ADSs.\nHolders of our ADSs may be subject to limitations on transfer of their ADSs.\nADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any\ntime or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the\ndepositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the\ndepositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deems it advisable to do so because of any requirement\n65\nof law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any\nother reason in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement. These limitations on transfer may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the value of our ADSs.\nThe rights of our shareholders may differ from the rights typically offered to shareholders of a U.S. corporation.\nWe are incorporated under English law. The rights of holders of ordinary shares and, therefore, certain of the rights\nof holders of ADSs, are governed by English law, including the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, and by our\nArticles of Association. These rights differ in certain material respects from the rights of shareholders in typical U.S.\ncorporations. As a result, investors in our ordinary shares or ADSs may not have the same protections or rights as\nthey would if they had invested in a U.S. corporation. This may make our ADSs less attractive to such investors,\nwhich could harm the value of our ADSs.\nClaims of U.S. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us.\nWe are incorporated under English law. Substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. The\nmajority of our senior management and board of directors reside outside the United States. As a result, it may not be\npossible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons or to enforce judgments\nobtained in U.S. courts against them or us, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the\nU.S. federal securities laws.\nThe United States and the United Kingdom do not currently have a treaty providing for recognition and enforcement\nof judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for\npayment given by a court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not\nautomatically be recognized or enforceable in the United Kingdom. In addition, uncertainty exists as to whether\nU.K. courts would entertain original actions brought in the United Kingdom against us or our directors or senior\nmanagement predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. Any final and\nconclusive monetary judgment for a definite sum obtained against us in U.S. courts would be treated by the courts of\nthe United Kingdom as a cause of action in itself and sued upon as a debt at common law so that no retrial of the\nissues would be necessary, provided that certain requirements are met. Whether these requirements are met in\nrespect of a judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws, including whether the\naward of monetary damages under such laws would constitute a penalty, is an issue for the court making such\ndecision. If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will\nbe enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the English court\ndiscretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement.\nAs a result, U.S. investors may not be able to enforce against us or our senior management, board of directors or\ncertain experts named herein who are residents of the United Kingdom or countries other than the United States any\njudgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to\naccurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, shareholders could lose confidence in our\nfinancial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our ADSs.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and,\ntogether with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement\nrequired new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet\nour reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404, or any subsequent\ntesting by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes\nto our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inadequate internal controls\ncould also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative\neffect on the trading price of our ADSs.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nChanges in our tax rates, unavailability of certain tax credits or reliefs or exposure to additional tax liabilities or\nassessments could affect our profitability, and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for\nprior periods.\n66\nNew income, sales use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, or\ninterpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us, any of which could adversely affect our business\noperations and financial performance. We are currently unable to predict whether such changes will occur and, if so,\nthe ultimate impact on our business. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us, including as a\nresult of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nWe carry out research and development activities including, but not limited to, developing ensifentrine for various\nindications and delivery methods, and as a result we currently benefit in the U.K. from the HM Revenue and\nCustoms, or HMRC, small and medium sized enterprises research and development relief, or SME R&D Relief,\nwhich currently provides relief against U.K. Corporation Tax.\nBroadly, SME R&D Relief comprises two elements, (a) allowing qualifying SMEs to deduct a total of 186% of their\nqualifying expenditure from their yearly profit for U.K. Corporation Tax purposes (the deduction is given by\nallowing an additional 86% deduction plus the usual 100% deduction), or the SME R&D Additional Deduction and,\n(b) where there are not sufficient profits for U.K. Corporation Tax purposes to fully utilize the SME R&D\nAdditional Deduction, the excess (“surrenderable losses”) can be carried forward to offset against future taxable\nprofits, or a tax credit currently equal to 10% of such surrenderable loss can be claimed in cash, or the SME R&D\nTax Credit.\nBased on criteria established by HMRC a portion of expenditure incurred in relation to our research and\ndevelopment activities including, but not limited to, operating clinical trials, manufacturing, consultant and salary\nand related costs, is eligible for the SME R&D Additional Deduction. Our consequential surrenderable losses are\ncurrently eligible for the SME R&D Tax Credit, in accordance with HMRC criteria.\nIn the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we recorded SME R&D\nTax Credits of $2.3 million and $8.6 million, respectively. Based on the HMRC criteria, we expect to receive these\nSME R&D Tax Credits in the year ending December 31, 2024.\nChanges to the U.K.’s SME R&D Relief regime may adversely affect our financial condition. At the 2023 Autumn\nStatement, the U.K. Government confirmed that it would introduce a single R&D relief regime which merges the\ncurrent “RDEC” and SME R&D Relief scheme. The proposed credit rate under the draft legislation is 20% of\nqualifying expenditure, with the credit itself subject to U.K. corporation tax. The credit will therefore be reduced by\nthe applicable rate of U.K. corporation tax (the main rate of which is currently 25%), although the notional tax rate\nthat applies to loss-making companies will be set at the lower rate of 19% for the purposes of the new R&D relief\nregime. Therefore, under the proposed regime and current rates of U.K. corporation tax, profitable businesses\nsubject to the main rate of U.K. corporation tax will effectively receive a credit of 15% of qualifying expenditure\nwhilst loss-making businesses will receive a credit of 16.2%. The proposed legislation also contains restrictions on\nR&D relief which can be claimed where a company contracts R&D activity to a third party or makes payments for\nexternally provided workers so that, broadly, a taxpayer will only be able to claim relief where the work is\nperformed in the U.K. It is proposed that the only expenditure allowable outside the U.K. would be for activities\nwhich are necessary due to geographical, environmental or social conditions not present or replicable in the U.K.\nThe proposed legislation also contains new rules relating to subcontracting of R&D activities to a third party.\nIn addition, it is proposed that for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2024, the R&D intensive loss-\nmaking SME scheme threshold (broadly, the proportion of qualifying R&D expenditure compared to total\nexpenditure) will be 30%. Therefore, loss-making SMEs with qualifying R&D expenditure of 30% or more of its\ntotal expenditure may claim an enhanced deduction of 86% and a repayable credit of 14.5%.\nIt is proposed that the new U.K. R&D tax relief regime will apply to accounting periods starting on or after 1 April\n2024. The legislation for the new regime is not yet finalized and therefore the impact on our financial position\ncannot be fully known, however the proposed changes to the scheme and/or any further changes could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we were classified as a passive foreign investment company, it would result in adverse U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to U.S. holders.\nBased on the composition of our income and assets and the value of our assets in the taxable year ended December\n31, 2023, we believe that we are a Passive Foreign Investment Company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2023. However, no assurances regarding our PFIC status can be\nprovided for any past taxable years, the taxable year ending December 31, 2024, or any future taxable years. If we\nare classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder (as defined below) holds our ordinary\nshares or ADSs, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to such U.S. Holder, including (i)\n67\nthe treatment of all or a portion of any gain on disposition of our ordinary shares or ADSs as ordinary income, (ii)\nthe application of a deferred interest charge on such gain and the receipt of certain dividends, and (iii) the obligation\nto comply certain reporting requirements. We cannot provide any assurances that we will furnish to any U.S. Holder\ninformation that may be necessary to comply with the aforementioned reporting and tax payment obligations.\nA non-U.S. corporation will generally be considered a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for any taxable\nyear in which (i) 75% or more of its gross income consists of passive income or (ii) 50% or more of the average\nquarterly value of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. For\npurposes of these tests, passive income includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment\nproperty and certain rents and royalties. In addition, for purposes of the above calculations, a non-U.S. corporation\nthat directly or indirectly owns at least 25% by value of the shares of another corporation is treated as holding and\nreceiving directly its proportionate share of the assets and income of such corporation. The determination of whether\nwe are a PFIC is a fact-intensive determination made on an annual basis applying principles and methodologies that\nin some circumstances are unclear and subject to varying interpretation. Under the income test, our status as a PFIC\ndepends on the composition of our income which will depend on the transactions we enter into and our corporate\nstructure. The composition of our income and assets is also affected by the spending of the cash we raise in any\noffering. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisors with respect to the potential adverse U.S. tax\nconsequences to it if we are a PFIC.\nA “U.S. Holder” is a holder who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares\nor ADSs and who is a citizen or individual resident of the United States; a corporation, or other entity taxable as a\ncorporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state therein or the District of\nColumbia; an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or a trust\nthat (i) is subject to the supervision of a U.S. court and all substantial decisions of which are subject to the control of\none or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (ii) has a valid\nelection in effect to be treated as a United States person.\nIf we are classified as a PFIC in any year with respect to which a U.S. Holder owns our ordinary shares or ADSs, we\nwill continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder in all succeeding years during which the U.S.\nHolder owns our ordinary shares or ADSs, regardless of whether we continue to meet the PFIC test described above,\nunless the U.S. Holder makes a specified election once we cease to be a PFIC.\nIf a U.S. Holder is treated as owning at least 10% of our ordinary shares or ADSs, such holder may be subject to\nadverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nIf a U.S. Holder (as defined above) is treated as owning, directly, indirectly or constructively, at least 10% of the\nvalue or voting power of our ordinary shares or ADSs, such U.S. Holder may be treated as a “United States\nshareholder” with respect to each “controlled foreign corporation” or “CFC” in our group, if any. Because our group\nincludes one or more U.S. subsidiaries, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be treated as CFCs, regardless of\nwhether we are treated as a CFC. A United States shareholder of a CFC may be required to annually report and\ninclude in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of “Subpart F income,” “global intangible low-taxed income”\nand investments in U.S. property by such CFCs, regardless of whether such CFC make any distributions. An\nindividual that is a United States shareholder with respect to a CFC generally would not be allowed certain tax\ndeductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a United States shareholder that is a U.S. corporation.\nFailure to comply with these reporting obligations may subject a United States shareholder to significant monetary\npenalties and may prevent the statute of limitations with respect to such shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax return\nfor the year for which reporting was due from starting. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist our\ninvestors in determining whether we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are treated as a CFC or whether such\ninvestor is treated as a United States shareholder with respect to any of such CFCs. Further, we cannot provide any\nassurances that we will furnish to any United States shareholder information that may be necessary to comply with\nthe reporting and tax paying obligations described in this risk factor. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors\nregarding the potential application of these rules to their investment in our ordinary shares or ADSs.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of our ADSs may be volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control.\nThe trading market for publicly traded emerging biopharmaceutical and drug discovery and development companies\nhas been highly volatile and is likely to remain highly volatile in the future. The market price of our ADSs may\nfluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including:\n• positive or negative results from, or delays in, clinical trials of ensifentrine;\n68\n• developments in our competitors’ businesses;\n• delays in entering into collaborations and strategic relationships with respect to development or\ncommercialization of ensifentrine or entry into collaborations and strategic relationships on terms that are not\ndeemed to be favorable to us;\n• technological innovations or commercial product introductions by us or competitors;\n• changes in government regulations;\n• developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and litigation matters;\n• public concern relating to the commercial value or safety of ensifentrine;\n• financing or other corporate transactions;\n• publication of research reports or comments by securities or industry analysts or commentators;\n• general market conditions in the pharmaceutical industry or in the economy as a whole;\n• the loss of any of our key scientific or senior management personnel;\n• sales of our ADSs by us, our senior management or board members, and significant holders of our ADSs; or\n• other events and factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our ADSs to fluctuate\nsubstantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily\nselling their ADSs and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our ADSs. In addition, the stock market in\ngeneral, and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations\nthat have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past,\nwhen the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class\naction litigation against the issuer. If any of the holders of our ADSs were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we\ncould incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our senior management would be diverted\nfrom the operation of our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant\nliabilities.\nFuture sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial number of our ADSs or ordinary shares could\nadversely affect the price of our ADSs.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of our ADSs or ordinary shares, or the perception that such sales will occur,\ncould cause a decline in the market price of our ADSs. Sales in the United States of our ADSs and ordinary shares\nheld by our directors, officers and affiliated shareholders are subject to restrictions. If these shareholders sell\nsubstantial amounts of ordinary shares or ADSs in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may\noccur, the market price of our ADSs and our ability to raise capital through an issue of equity securities in the future\ncould be adversely affected.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business and financial\ncondition and the price of our ADSs. The global economy, including credit and financial markets, has recently\nexperienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rising\ninterest and inflation rates, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in\nunemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. If the equity and credit markets continue to\ndeteriorate or the United Kingdom or the United States enters a recession, it may make any necessary debt or equity\nfinancing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. In\naddition, there is a risk that one or more of our CROs, suppliers or other third-party providers may not survive an\neconomic downturn or recession. As a result, our business, results of operations and price of our ADSs may be\nadversely affected.\nIf securities or industry analysts or commentators publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our\nbusiness, the price of our ADSs and ordinary shares and our trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our ADSs and ordinary shares depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts or commentators publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us\ndowngrade our ADSs or if they or other industry commentators publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or\ncomments about our business, the price of our ADSs and ordinary shares would likely decline. If one or more of\n69\nthese analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our ADSs could decrease,\nwhich might cause the price of our ADSs and ordinary shares and trading volume to decline.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company in\nthe United States, and our senior management are required to devote substantial time to new compliance\ninitiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a U.S. public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other\nexpenses that we did not incur prior to becoming a U.S. public company, including in connection with our transition\nto large accelerated filer as of December 31, 2023. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and\nregulations impose various requirements on non-U.S. reporting public companies, including the establishment and\nmaintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our senior\nmanagement and other personnel have devoted and will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to\nthese compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial\ncompliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThese rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity,\nand, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and\ngoverning bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs\nnecessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by\nour senior management on our internal control over financial reporting and an attestation report on internal control\nover financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To prepare for and maintain\ncompliance with Section 404(b), we have implemented a process of documenting and evaluating our internal control\nover financial reporting. In this regard, we have dedicated, and will need to continue to dedicate, internal resources,\nengage outside consultants and pursue a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control\nover financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that\ncontrols are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will\nnot be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. If\nwe identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a\nloss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations are potentially vulnerable to interruption by fire, severe weather conditions, power loss,\ntelecommunications failure, terrorist activity, public health crises and pandemic diseases, and other natural and man-\nmade disasters or events beyond our control. Our facilities are located in regions that experience severe weather\nfrom time to time. We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business and\nfinancial results from a major tornado, flood, fire, earthquake, power loss, terrorist activity, public health crisis,\npandemic diseases or other disasters and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters. In addition, we do not carry\nsufficient insurance to compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur, and any\nlosses or damages incurred by us could harm our business. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions\ncould seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\n70\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nFrom time to time, our officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)) and directors may enter into Rule 10b5-1 or non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading plans (as each such term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).

All statements\ncontained in this presentation other than statements of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements. Words such as\n“anticipate,” “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “potential,” “prepare,” “possible” and similar words and expressions are intended to\nidentify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the potential benefits,\nefficacy, and approval of our drug Ohtuvayre , including, but not limited to, statements relating to the potential to change the treatment paradigm\nfor COPD patients, the anticipated timing of commercial availability and our ability to successfully market and sell Ohtuvayre.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but\ninvolve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be\nmaterially different from our expectations expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: our\nlimited operating history; our need for additional funding to complete development and commercialization of Ohtuvayre which may not be\navailable and which may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our development or commercialization efforts; our reliance on the success of\nOhtuvayre, our only commercial product; our reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers; the efficacy of OhtuvayreTM compared to\ncompeting drugs; our ability to successfully commercialize Ohtuvayre; serious adverse, undesirable or unacceptable side effects associated with\nOhtuvayre which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize Ohtuvayre; failure to develop Ohtuvayre for additional indications, alternate\ndelivery methods, or as a combination therapy; failure to obtain approval for and commercialize Ohtuvayre in multiple major pharmaceutical\nmarkets; lawsuits related to patents covering Ohtuvayre and the potential for our patents to be found invalid or unenforceable; lawsuits related to\nour licensing of patents and know-how from third parties for the commercialization of Ohtuvayre; changes in our tax rates, unavailability of certain\ntax credits or reliefs or exposure to additional tax liabilities or assessments that could affect our profitability, and audits by tax authorities that could\nresult in additional tax payments for prior periods; and our vulnerability to natural disasters, global economic factors, geo-political actions and\nunexpected events, including health epidemics or pandemics. These and other important factors discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 10, 2024,\nand our other reports filed with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements\nmade in this presentation.
