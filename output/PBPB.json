Through the agreement, Royal Restaurant Group, a national franchise group that successfully operates restaurant locations for global brands, will bring 15 Potbelly shops to Georgia, all in the greater Atlanta region. This is Potbelly’s first development agreement in Georgia and its second with Royal Restaurant Group. \n\n“The signing of this development agreement marks a significant step forward in the execution against our long-term plans for growth and expansion, as it marks our entrance into the Atlanta market and the great state of Georgia,” said Bob Wright, President and CEO of Potbelly. “We are so appreciative of the team at Royal Restaurant Group for their ongoing support and partnership in bringing our warm, toasty sandwiches, signature salads, hand-dipped shakes and other fresh menu items to markets in the Midwest and southern U.S.”\n\nThe commitment covers regions primarily in central and northern areas of the Atlanta market. Development is expected to begin in January 2026, with three shop openings anticipated for each year following.\n\nThis announcement builds on a separate, [40-shop agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R4C6KXlGp3k7B-J3HNOcTmXl5a8fFfbR7dpWZskFayjJI2KCfXNkMaRona8INcTQdTExZwqeVFW2CDlMNvERcvBkYNXW-aGAjRScEviyyeQg50LJWqsIn6uut5xcS4Ry4mBcE7TXUqg4S8-MWf4pXGlvaNLcUs_f6pHGnLMDtu63yxClsdJBCI_yj6p2W9wIhOEhZUelaxwoNYqsZeDC_C4DwOmmRjkxmflOCdME6M0= \"40-shop agreement\") that Potbelly signed with Royal Restaurant Group in October 2023. The franchisee currently has four Potbelly shops in operation and a strong pipeline of sites currently in development across markets in Ohio and Florida. The co-founders of Royal Restaurant Group collectively have more than 60 years of combined experience in the restaurant, hospitality and multi-unit franchise industries. Previously the co-founders served as the CEO and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, of one of Wendy’s largest franchise organizations with more than 230 units throughout the United States.\n\n“Our deep industry experience and focus on customer service align perfectly with Potbelly’s vision of delivering guests great food, good vibes, and an overall exceptional experience,” said Randy Pianin, Co-founder and CEO of Royal Restaurant Group. “We’ve seen successful returns with the four shops we currently operate, and we look forward to introducing Potbelly’s one-of-a-kind offerings to hungry diners in Georgia in the years ahead.”\n\nPotbelly has a long-term goal of reaching 2,000 shops over the next several years, with at least 85% of those locations being franchised, as part of the company’s Franchise Growth Acceleration Initiative.\n\nPotbelly is seeking additional qualified candidates for development opportunities in other areas of the Atlanta market. Franchising opportunities are also available in markets across the U.S. including parts of Florida and Tennessee, Dallas, Houston and other Texas markets, and markets in OH, VA, and PA.
