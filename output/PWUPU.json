Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us with me on the call. Today are Balu\nBalakrishnan, Chairman and CEO of Power Integrations and Sandeep Nayyar, our chief financial officer.\nDuring this call, we will refer to financial measures not calculated according to GAAP. Non-GAAP measures\nexclude stock based compensation expenses, amortization of acquisition related and tangible assets and\nthe tax effects of these items. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to our GAAP results is included in\ntoday's press release. Our discussion today including the Q&A session will include forward-looking\nstatements denoted by words like will, would, believe, should, expect, outlook, forecast, estimate, anticipate\nand similar expressions that look toward future events or performance. Such statements are subject to risks\nand uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Such\nrisks are discussed in today's press release and in our most recent form, 10-K filed with the SEC on\nFebruary 12th, 2024. Now I'll turn the call over to Balu.\nBalu Balakrishnan - Power Integrations Inc – Chairman and CEO\nThanks Joe and good afternoon.\nOur third quarter results were on target with revenues up 9% sequentially to $116 million, non-GAAP gross\nmargin of 55.1% and non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 per share.\nOur revenue outlook for the fourth quarter is $105 million plus or minus 5 million. The decrease from Q3\nreflects a soft demand environment called out this quarter by many of our analog peers and by some of our\nkey customers in the appliance market. Appliances account for the bulk of our consumer category which\ncomprises nearly 40% of our sales.\nFurther tempering the outlook in consumer is a build-up of appliance inventory at Chinese OEMs ahead of\nthe China government's long-awaited consumer stimulus program, which thus far appears to be having a\nlimited impact.\nOverall, while the recovery is proceeding in fits and starts, we are pleased to be returning to year over year\ngrowth with the midpoint of our Q4 forecast up 17% compared to last year. We also expect to remain at the\nhigh end of our gross margin model through at least next year thanks to the dollar/yen exchange rate and\na favorable end market mix. While all four of our end markets should grow in 2025 we expect the strongest\ngrowth from industrial, which has the highest margins of our four categories.\nWe expect growth in multiple sub segments of industrial led by high power with particular strength in high\nvoltage DC transmission projects. Long-distance DC transmission lines deliver renewable energy efficiently\nto the grid and are also a key part of efforts to modernize power infrastructure to enhance energy security\nand meet the increasing power needs of AI data centers. In Q3, we won high-voltage DC designs with\nexpected annual revenue value of more than $5 million including our second multi-million dollar design win\nfor TenneT, a major Northern European grid operator.\nWe also expect to begin delivery of our Scale™-2 gate drivers in early 2025 for two other major projects,\nphase one of Saudi Arabia's planned nine-gigawatt link between Yanbu and NEOM, and an undersea link\nconnecting the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido.\nMetering is another growth driver in the industrial category, most notably in India where our meeting\nbusiness is on track to double this year as the government continues with its planned installation of 250\nmillion smart meters over the next few years. We have earned a sizable share of that market and expect\ndollar content to increase over time as customers migrate to our 900- and 1250-volt can products to achieve\nhigher efficiency and reliability.\nWhile still early in its revenue ramp, automotive will contribute to our industrial revenues in 2025 leading up\nto an inflection in 2026. Building on our early success in China with drivetrain emergency power supplies,\nwe're expanding both geographically and in the range of sockets we are winning as EVs evolve to a\ndistributed architecture requiring multiple converters to power subsystems from the main battery instead of\na 12-volt battery.\nWe achieved an important milestone in September becoming an approved vendor at the world's largest\ntier-one automotive supplier, on the heels of our recent qualification at a major Japanese tier-one. We've\nalso had key developments at two American EV customers in recent weeks. Pre-production began last\nweek on a micro DC-DC converter socket using our silicon carbide InnoSwitch™, while another customer\nawarded us an emergency power supply socket using a 900-volt GaN InnoSwitch, with production\nscheduled to begin in 2026.\nIn our consumer category, notwithstanding the soft demand environment, our position in appliances\nremains strong, and we are leveraging our market leadership to capture incremental dollar content driven\nby connectivity, LED lighting, brushless DC motors and other features being added to appliances. We're\nalso seeing strong design activity related to new EU standby rules set to take effect next year.\nWe are capitalizing on these opportunities with BridgeSwitch™ motor-drive ICs and GaN products including\nInnoMux™-2, which enables much higher efficiency in appliances, displays and industrial applications\nthrough the use of zero-voltage switching and the elimination of multiple DC-to-DC converters at the output.\nEarlier this week, we introduced a new version of InnoMux-2 featuring the industry's first 1700-volt GaN\nswitch, marking another milestone on the technology roadmap we presented at our investor day in 2022.\nWe developed our proprietary GAN process and device designs with five key attributes in mind: cost\nreliability, ease of use, voltage and power, and we are executing to plan on each of them.\nWe concluded early on that even with its superior performance, our GaN had to be cost-competitive with\nsilicon to achieve mass adoption. Over the past six years we have executed an aggressive cost-reduction\nroadmap that has our GaN on the verge of parity with the most advanced silicon MOSFETs, but with far\nsuperior performance.\nReservations about reliability and ease of use are the top concerns we hear from automotive and AI\ndatacenter customers that have struggled to use discrete GaN devices. We designed PowiGaN™ to be\ninherently more reliable than other GaN technologies, and we now have over a trillion hours of field\noperation to prove it.\nOur GaN is also easy to use because of the system-level approach that has defined our product strategy\nfor the past thirty years. Not only are discrete power devices eventually commoditized, they are also harder\nto use, and this is especially true of GaN because of its extremely high switching speed. PowiGaN switches\nare incorporated in system-level products with our innovative controllers and drivers that provide\ncomprehensive protection and optimize the performance of the switch, eliminating the trickiest aspects of\ndesigning with GaN.\nEngineers familiar with our silicon-based products can use GaN versions of the same products seamlessly,\ntaking advantage of GaN’s superior performance with no added design effort. In fact, this strategy has\nworked so well with our InnoSwitch products that we are now refreshing some high-volume legacy products\nwith GaN to enhance the performance and extend the power ranges of products that our customers love to\nuse.\nWe also have a pipeline of new system-level GaN products targeting higher-power applications we don’t\naddress today, including AI datacenter, EV onboard chargers, telecom infrastructure and more. These\nproducts will help us reach our goal of expanding our SAM to an estimated eight billion dollars over the next\nfew years.\nIn terms of voltage, while the leading foundry technology is limited to 750 volts, our unique process and\ndevice technologies offer a clear path to higher voltages. Following our announcement earlier this week,\nwe now have GaN devices at 750, 900, 1250 and 1700 volts, with more to come.\nMany industrial customers prefer higher voltage ratings for three-phase applications, and as insurance\nagainst surges and spikes, especially in areas with unstable AC grid voltages. In the EV market, a 1700-\nvolt rating is essential for flyback power supplies in 800- and thousand-volt systems, which today can only\nbe addressed by silicon carbide.\nThe final track of our GaN roadmap is power, and we’re approaching that from multiple directions. The\noutput capability of our current technology continues to increase and is now in tens of kilowatts. We are\nalso developing an all-new GaN technology capable of delivering hundreds of kilowatts, which we believe\nwould make GaN an alternative to silicon carbide in drivetrain inverters, at much lower cost and with\nsuperior performance. While the necessary breakthroughs are still a few years away, we are excited about\nour progress, and our acquisition of Odyssey last quarter will help accelerate our development.\nWhile the full disruptive potential of GaN will unfold over many years to come, we expect wider GaN\nadoption to be a significant growth driver in 2025, when GaN products should account for more than 10\npercent of sales. Recent wins include a major next-generation game console, now ramping with GaN\nInnoSwitch ICs, a 65-watt notebook adapter for Vaio, and a 140-watt multi-port adapter for Asus containing\nGaN InnoSwitch and HiperPFS power-factor ICs.\nWe are also seeing existing designs migrate to GaN, such as our 5G fixed wireless design in India. That\nprogram ramped this year with silicon-based products but should generate incremental growth next year\nas the customer adds GaN to the mix, mainly to reduce the size of the power supply.\nTo conclude, though our outlook reflects industry-wide demand softness, we expect strong year-over-year\ngrowth in Q4. While 2024 revenues will be down from the prior year due to the losses we suffered in the\nChina cellphone market early in the year, combined sales into the industrial, consumer and computer\ncategories will be up mid-to-high teens for 2024. We expect that momentum to carry into 2025, sustained\nby strong growth in GaN products and high power, a broad range of new design wins and a return to growth\nin communications driven by non-cellphone applications.\nAnd now I’ll turn it over to Sandeep for a review of the financials.\nSandeep Nayyar - Power Integrations Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President - Finance\nThanks Balu, and good afternoon. As usual I will focus my remarks on the non-GAAP results, which are\nreconciled to GAAP in our press release.\nThird-quarter revenues were 116 million dollars, just over the midpoint of our guidance range, while non-\nGAAP earnings were 40 cents per diluted share, above the level implied in our guidance as we came in\nslightly better on gross margin and operating expenses.\nWhile we expect sequentially lower revenues in Q4, we are returning to year-over-year growth as Balu\nnoted, and believe we are poised for strong growth in 2025. Reflecting confidence in our outlook, as well\nas our healthy balance sheet, our board has declared a five-percent dividend increase and authorized 50\nmillion dollars for share repurchases, commencing in the coming days subject to price/volume thresholds\nprescribed by the board.\nReturning to the quarterly results, revenues were up nine percent compared to the prior quarter. Industrial\nrevenues grew mid-teens sequentially driven by high power, home-and-building automation, and metering\napplications. Broad-based industrial also showed sequential improvement as distribution inventories\ndeclined further in Q3 and are now at historically normal levels.\nThe communications category was up about 20 percent sequentially driven mainly by the ramp of our 5G\nfixed wireless business in India, as well as seasonal growth in smartphone chargers.\nRevenues from the computer category were up about 10 percent sequentially on strength in OEM and\naftermarket notebook chargers.\nConsumer was flat sequentially as seasonal softness in air conditioning was offset by strength in major\nappliance and gaming. Distribution sell-through for consumer was less than sell-in, reflecting the trends\nBalu mentioned, and resulting in higher channel inventory for consumer compared to the prior quarter.\nOverall, channel inventory increased to 8.6 weeks, up from 7.8 weeks at the end of June, with the increase\ndriven entirely by consumer. Channel inventory for each of the other categories decreased from the prior\nquarter.\nRevenue mix for the quarter was 38 percent consumer, 36 percent industrial, 14 percent computer and 12\npercent communications.\nNon-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 55.1 percent, up one percentage point from the prior\nquarter driven mainly by higher back-end manufacturing volumes.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were 43.7 million dollars, down 500 thousand sequentially despite the\naddition of about half a million dollars from Odyssey.\nNon-GAAP earnings for the third quarter were 40 cents per diluted share. Diluted share count for the quarter\nwas 57 million, unchanged from the prior quarter.\nCash flow from operations was 33 million dollars, while capex was six million dollars. Other key uses of\ncash were 10 million dollars for the Odyssey acquisition and 11 million for dividends.\nInventory days fell to 291 at quarter-end, down 21 days from the prior quarter.\nTurning to the Q4 outlook, we expect revenues to be 105 million dollars, plus or minus five million.\nNon-GAAP gross margin should be between 55 and 55.5 percent, as compared to 55.1 percent in Q3. The\nslight sequential increase at the midpoint reflects an increased percentage of revenues from the industrial\ncategory, which is our highest margin end-market.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses should be between 44.5 and 45 million dollars, up modestly from the third\nquarter driven mainly by headcount increases. For the full year, non-GAAP OPEX will be up just four percent\nfrom the prior year, with one percentage point of the increase driven by the Odyssey purchase.\nFinally, I expect our effective tax rate to remain in the low single digits in Q4, and then to increase into the\nmid-single digits for 2025.\nAnd now operator let’s begin the Q&A session.\nDavid Williams - Benchmark Company - Analyst\nThanks for letting me ask a question. And, and forgive me, I missed a little bit of the call here had some\nissues but you know, lots of things, lots of moving pieces here. But the one thing I did want to ask was\njust around the the 1700-volt GaN announcement that you had recently. Can you talk maybe just a little\nbit about that, how you see demand developing and maybe just where that fits in? Is it industrial\nautomotive and, and given the what would seem like large markets, how you think that ramps.\nBalu Balakrishnan - Power Integrations Inc - Chairman and CEO\nYeah, the 1,700 volt is required to operate from 800 volt and 1,000 volt battery systems in automotive\napplications. The cars are moving from 400 to 800 the larger vehicles like trucks and the heavy vehicles\nare moving to 1,000 volts. And so this is a perfect fit for that market. And also in three phase industrial\napplications, they prefer to have a pretty high voltage rating because these meters sit directly on very low\nimpedance lines next to the transformer, for example. As a result, they can get a significant transient from\nlightning and so on. So they prefer the 1,700 volts. Currently, this market is served by silicon carbide. We\nbelieve GaN is a much better solution both in terms of efficiency and cost.\nDavid Williams - Benchmark Company - Analyst\nGreat. Thanks so much. I really appreciate the color. They're very helpful. And then just lastly, I wanted to\nask maybe broader but just thinking of last night’s election, are there areas of your business you think will\nbe will benefit or maybe be impacted by the new administration and specifically thinking about\nrenewables and solar applications, but also just some of the energy efficiency regulations and any other\ncolor on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nBalu Balakrishnan - Power Integrations Inc - Chairman and CEO\nYou know, that's, that's a good question. You know, we, I haven't thought through all of that but I would\nsay that the the train has left the station when it comes to electric cars and renewables and so on. The\nrenewables are now less expensive than coal plants. So most companies, most countries are installing\nadditional capacity in renewals renewables for that exact reason. Of course, there is also the\nenvironmental benefit which I think you know that the entire world now recognizes is critical given all the\nclimate disasters we have had over the last few years. So I am not at all concerned that it will in any way\nslow down. Either electric car, cars or renewables or high voltage DC transmission systems. And let me\ntalk a little bit more about high voltage DC transmission. The high voltage DC transmission is much more\nefficient than AC transmission and it is really quite integral to any new power station, whether it's\nrenewable or nuclear. If, if you have a power station and you have to transmit that to a load, let's say AI\ndata center, for example, you have to have a very efficient way to do that and the DC transmission does\nexactly that. And then if you have offshore wind farms the only way to get the power on shore on the\nground is through DC transmission. AC would be way too lossy in terms of the cables. So I don't think the\ntrend has any impact on our you know, our business in fact, I would say in terms of you know, generating\nmore oil, it'll have a positive impact on our high power business because we sell into applications like\nfracking. They need large motors to pump liquids into the ground. And that's a huge market for us in\nterms of our high power board level business.\nJeremy Kwan - Stifel\nThank you. This is Jeremy calling for Tore. Yeah, let me add my congrats on that 1,700 volts product\nthat's that we've been waiting for that and it's very nice to see just to follow up on, on that point. I guess\ncan you talk about maybe, you know how much of a lead you have in in high-power GaN? And you talked\nabout the price, almost price parity with silicon. Can you talk about maybe how it compares to silicon\ncarbide? How much of a, I guess advantage you have in that space? Thank you.\nBalu Balakrishnan - Power Integrations Inc - Chairman and CEO\nThanks Jeremy. Excellent question. Let me start with the 750 volt GaN, which primarily competes with the\nMOSFETs and there we think we're getting very close to being parity with the you know, even the high end\nMOSFETs within the next year or so. And at 750 volts, we are also very cost competitive with the silicon or\nsilicon carbide. Of course, if you are cost competitive with silicon, you are dramatically cost competitive with\nsilicon carbide. And these applications include AI data centers. It includes on board charges for electric\nvehicles. It also includes telecom infrastructure.\nAll of these are in the I would say 1 to 20 kilowatt range and we already have products in development.\nThese products will be ready sometime in 2026. And that opens up a huge market for us. So with our\nexisting 750 volt technology, we can be very competitive with silicon and of course much more competitive\nthan silicon carbide all the way up to tens of kilowatts.\nNow, when you go to higher voltages like 1,250 volts and 1,700 volts, the real competition is silicon carbide\nand we are very competitive with silicon carbide up to about 100 plus watts. Our products currently we've\nintroduced are in the just under 100 watts and we are very competitive there.\nNow, if you want to go to much higher power levels like hundreds of kilowatts, that's where we need new\ntechnology. We are working on that for some time now. And with the acquisition of Odyssey Semiconductor,\nwe will be able to speed up the technology because it comes with the fab. It also comes with people with\nthe knowledge of the device and we have made a lot of progress on that. We have a few more\nbreakthroughs to get there. And we are now beginning to feel that we can get there in the next 3 to 5 years.\nAnd when we get there, we'll have a very, very competitive offering compared to silicon carbide will not only\nbe lower cost than silicon carbide at those power levels, but it'll also be much higher performance than\nsilicon carbide. So, and as you all know, silicon carbide requires a lot of capital investment whereas the\nGaN does not and GaN inherently is going to be cost effective long term because of you know, the\ntemperatures at which they're manufactured, which is similar to silicon. And therefore, it doesn't require\nanywhere near the amount of energy consumption that silicon carbide requires. Silicon carbide. As many\nof you know, it requires manufacturing at 2000 degrees which is about half the temperature of the sun by\nthe way. And it takes a lot of money, a lot of energy and a lot of capital investment to do that. And that is\nnot the case with silicon or for GaN. So we really think GaN would be the most attractive alternative to\nsilicon carbide all the way up to several 100 kilowatts once we have this new technology up and running.\nJeremy Kwan - Stifel\nThank you for that. That's very, very helpful. And then maybe as a follow up, you mentioned, you know,\nmigrating some of your legacy products to GaN, can you give us a sense of how much of your portfolio is\nconsisting of GaN now and, and how much maybe you intend to convert. I know you also targeted 10% of\nrevenue for GaN. I think it was next year. You know, as you look, it might be kind of further out but 3 to 5\nyears out, how much revenue do you expect to drive from GaN? Thank you.\nBalu Balakrishnan - Power Integrations Inc - Chairman and CEO\nYou know, GaN is going to replace silicon as a high voltage switch in pretty much all of our products.\nEverything we are designing now is using GaN. You know, except at very low power levels, which is really\nnot our focus at this point. We are focusing on higher and higher power levels, for example, the AI data\ncenter product or onboard charger product, those are all GaN products. And that's the only way to get the\nperformance you need – it’s the only way to get the power levels you need. You know, the silicon just won't\ncut it at, at those power levels, you know, 10, 15 kilowatts, even though silicon is predominantly used today,\nthat's only because GaN technology is not high enough reliability. At least from a customer's point of view\nare not easy to use. That's where our technology will shine, we have much higher reliability than anybody\nelse's GaN technology. And we also have easier to use product because we don't sell them as discrete, we\nsell them as system-level products. So the customers don't have to deal with all the idiosyncrasies of GaN\nnot only in terms of protecting the gGaN but also getting the most performance out of the GaN.\nSo I think that, you know, the future of our company is, is going to be GaN. And we, I mean, if you were to\nask me where we would be in terms of revenue, I wouldn't be surprised if you, if we cross 100 million by\n2028 in GaN products. But that's only because in some areas, it takes longer for the GaN to be, the new\nproducts to be adopted. But we are seeing GaN growth in all four of our markets. You know, we actually\ngrew GaN revenue in all markets except cell phones where as you know, the people are going out of the\nbox and therefore there was a little bit of a drag in that market. But if you take out cell phones, we grew\nvery nicely this year. And of course, we're going to grow very nicely next year and onward.\nSandeep Nayyar - Power Integrations Inc - CFO\nJeremy in the next few years, GaN is going to be really growing quite a bit and I can see it being about 20%\nof our revenue in the next 2 to 3 years.\nChristopher Rolland - Susquehanna\nHey, guys, thanks for the question. I guess first of all, if you guys could help us kind of force rank the\nsegments for your outlook next quarter, I guess maybe versus the, I think it was down nine sequential.\nWhat, what, what would be better, what would be worse? And I know it's probably a bit early for March, but\nwe track that seasonally is flat. I wonder if you had a early expectation there for, for growth. Thank you.\nSandeep Nayyar - Power Integrations Inc - CFO\nSo I think for the next quarter as we indicated, the industrial segment from a dollar standpoint will be kind\nof flattish. So as because the revenue is lower it will be higher as a percentage of revenue and the other\nthree segments will be down. So that's the directional answer we can give you at this point of time for the\nQ4 in Q1. It's a little early. But I think in historical terms in Q1, typically you see the high-power business\nwhich is in the industrial segment is, tends to be a little lower and cell phones are a little lower and AC which\nis air conditioning starts ramping up. So that's the directional idea that I can give you for Q1, but it's a little\ntoo early.\nChristopher Rolland - Susquehanna\nYes. Thank you, Sandeep. And then, I would like to understand the inventory across these end markets.\nYou know, where it's still worse, overall, you know, sell-in versus sell-through. How do you think that kind\nof finished across distribution for the quarter? And then lastly, you know, tying all into this, the appliance\nmarket, I think what you were saying is finished white goods inventory was built ahead of this China stimulus\nif I understand that correctly. And yeah, just, just putting all this together from inventory and then sell and\nsell through would be great. Thank you.\nSandeep Nayyar - Power Integrations Inc - CFO\nYes. As we said on our call that the major sell-through, you know that the sell-in was higher than sell\nthrough. And the reason was mainly in the area of consumer. If you look at the prior quarter, our consumer\ninventory was way below our eight weeks. But this quarter because of the Chinese inventory build, our sell\nin was greater than sales. It was entirely in the consumer segment. So as a result, our consumer end\ninventory in the channel is slightly above the eight weeks, which is normal whereas all the other areas, it\nhas come back to the normal level.\nChristopher Rolland - Susquehanna\nOkay. Understood. And sorry, did I get the dynamic correct on the build ahead of white box and appliance\ninventory. Was that correct?\nBalu Balakrishnan - Power Integrations Inc – Chairman and CEO\nThat's correct. In the first half, we had very strong consumer business, which was kind of a false positive.\nOur consumer customers, which is appliance customers, they thought second half will be very strong,\nespecially in China because of the incentives, they were expecting the government to provide for purchase\nof appliances. Now, first of all the, you know, it came very late, the incentives and also the incentive is not\nuniform, they are different in different parts of China. And it's not clear to us so far that there's any significant\nbenefit or impact of those incentives on the demand. So the appliance customers who are expecting a\nstrong demand in the second half, they don't see, they didn't see that – the demand continues to be weak.\nSo they ended up with a bunch of inventory. And you have to remember they always build the power supply\nfirst before they build the end product because they don't want the end product to wait for the power supply.\nAnd so we had a very strong consumer business in the first half. And unfortunately, in the second half, it\nhas slowed down significantly because of the finished goods inventory of the end product at our customers.\nOur distribution inventory is slightly above, it's not so bad, but it was significantly below as we pointed out\nlast quarter. So it was a surprise to us that the sell through in consumer was slow. We expected a strong\nconsumer in the second half based on what we saw in the first half.\nJoe Shiffler - Power Integrations Inc - Director - Investor Relations\nAll right, thanks everyone for listening. There will be a replay of this call available on our investor website,\nwhich is investors.power.com. Thanks again and good afternoon."

Forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words “would,” “could,” “will,” “may,” “expect,”\n“believe,” “should,” “anticipate,” “if,” “future,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “potential,” “target,” “seek,” or “continue” and\nsimilar words and phrases, including the negatives of these terms, or other variations of these terms, that denote future events.\nThese statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and our potential financial performance and are\nsubject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and financial position to differ materially and/or adversely\nfrom what is projected or implied in any forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These\nfactors include, but are not limited to: if demand for our products continues to decline in our major end markets, our net\nrevenues will decline further; we do not have long-term contracts with any of our customers and if they fail to place, or if they\ncancel or reschedule orders for our products, our operating results and our business may suffer; our products are sold through\ndistributors, which limits our direct interaction with our end customers, therefore reducing our ability to forecast sales and\nincreasing the complexity of our business; if our products do not penetrate additional markets, our business will not grow as\nwe expect; intense competition in the high-voltage power supply industry may lead to a decrease in our average selling price\nand reduced sales volume of our products; we depend on third-party suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products, and\nif they fail to provide us sufficient quantities of wafers, our business may suffer; if we are unable to adequately protect or\nenforce our intellectual property rights, we could lose market share, incur costly litigation expenses, suffer incremental price\nerosion or lose valuable assets, any of which could harm our operations and negatively impact our profitability; and the other\nrisk factors described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and in Part I, Item 2 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We make these forward-looking statements based upon\ninformation available on the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update\nor alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or otherwise, except as required by laws.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant\nsubject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and\nwhile we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or\nincomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of,\nall potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to\nunduly rely upon these statements.\n3\nTable of Contents\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION:\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Power Integrations, Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation (the “Company”), and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation.\nWhile the financial information furnished is unaudited, the condensed consolidated financial statements included in\nthis report reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that the Company considers necessary for\nthe fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods covered and the financial condition of the Company at\nthe date of the interim balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S. GAAP”). The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. The\ncondensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in its Form 10-K filed on February 12, 2024,\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\nExcept for the additional policy presented below, no material changes have been made to the Company’s significant\naccounting policies disclosed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements, of the\nCompany’s financial statements set forth in Item 8 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on February 12,\n2024, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), in accounting for\nacquisitions. ASC 805 requires that the Company evaluates whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an\nacquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted\nand managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of\nthe acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a\nbusiness requires the Company to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the\nacquisition date fair values. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net acquisition date fair\nvalues of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to\naccurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, the\nestimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to\none year from the business acquisition date, the Company may record certain adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period\nor final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent\nadjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. All acquisition-related costs are accounted for as\nexpenses in the period in which they are incurred.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements and expand\npublic entities’ segment disclosures in the annual and interim financial statements. The amendment will require disclosure of\nsignificant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and within each reported\nmeasure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items and interim\ndisclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. All disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 are required for\nentities with a single reportable segment. The Company is required to adopt the amendments in fiscal year 2024 for annual\nand retrospective reporting periods and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 for all interim and retrospective reporting\nperiods; with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the amendment to have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose\n9\nTable of Contents\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense\nor benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations\n(separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to\ninternational, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued\nor made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is\npermitted. The Company does not expect the amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements\nupon adoption.\n3.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:\nThe FASB established a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as\nfollows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets in active markets; (Level 2) inputs other than the\nquoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which\nthere is little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the\nCompany to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining\nfair value.\nThe Company’s cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the\nfair-value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing\nsources with reasonable levels of price transparency.\n11\nTable of Contents\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe fair-value hierarchy of the Company’s cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, was as follows:\nFair Value Measurement at\nSeptember 30, 2024\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs\n(In thousands) Total Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2)\nCommercial paper $ 13,808 $ — $ 13,808\nCorporate securities 244,534 — 244,534\nMoney market funds 371 371 —\nU.S. government securities 1,000 — 1,000\nTotal $ 259,713 $ 371 $ 259,342\nFair Value Measurement at\nDecember 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs\n(In thousands) Total Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2)\nCommercial paper $ 20,275 $ — $ 20,275\nCorporate securities 246,922 — 246,922\nMoney market funds 491 491 —\nTotal $ 267,688 $ 491 $ 267,197\nThe Company did not transfer any investments between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair-value hierarchy in the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.\n5.

Stock-based compensation expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was\napproximately $25.8 million, comprising approximately $19.0 million related to RSUs, $5.6 million related to PSUs and\nPRSUs and $1.2 million related to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan.\n14\nTable of Contents\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nStock-based compensation expense in the three months ended September 30, 2023, was approximately $6.9 million,\ncomprising approximately $6.1 million related to RSUs, $0.3 million related to PSUs and PRSUs and $0.5 million related to\nthe Company’s employee stock purchase plan. Stock-based compensation expense in the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, was approximately $21.0 million, comprising approximately $17.3 million related to RSUs, $2.3 million\nrelated to PSUs and PRSUs and $1.4 million related to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan.\nPSU Awards\nUnder the performance-based awards program, the Company grants awards in the performance year in an amount\nequal to twice the target number of shares to be issued if the maximum performance metrics are met. The number of shares\nthat are released at the end of the performance year can range from zero to 200% of the target number depending on the\nCompany’s performance. The performance metrics of this program are annual targets consisting of a combination of net\nrevenue, non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals.\nAs the net revenue, non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals are considered performance conditions, expense\nassociated with these awards, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the\nexpected achievement of the performance targets. The fair value of these PSUs is determined using the fair value of the\nCompany’s common stock on the date of the grant, reduced by the discounted present value of dividends expected to be\ndeclared before the awards vest. If the performance conditions are not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any\npreviously recognized compensation is reversed.\nIn February 2024, it was determined that approximately 38,000 shares subject to the PSUs granted in 2023 vested in\naggregate; the shares were released to the Company’s employees and executives in the first quarter of 2024.\nA summary of PSUs outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and activity during the nine months ended, is presented\nbelow:\nWeighted-Average\nWeighted-Average Remaining Aggregate\nShares Grant Date Fair Contractual Term Intrinsic Value\n(In thousands) Value Per Share (In years) (In thousands)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 38 $ 82.95\nGranted 185 $ 69.97\nVested (38) $ 82.94\nForfeited (12) $ 70.16\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 173 $ 69.96 0.25 $ 11,121\nOutstanding and expected to vest at\nSeptember 30, 2024 75 0.25 $ 4,828\nPRSU Awards\nThe Company’s PRSU program provides for the issuance of PRSUs which will vest based on the Company’s\nperformance measured against the PRSU program’s established performance targets. PRSUs are granted in an amount equal to\ntwice the target number of shares to be issued if the maximum performance metrics are met. The actual number of shares the\nrecipient receives is determined at the end of a three-year performance period based on results achieved versus the Company’s\nperformance goals, and may range from zero to 200% of the target number. The performance goals for PRSUs granted in\nfiscal 2022, 2023 and 2024 were based on the Company’s compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of revenue as measured\nagainst the revenue CAGR of the analog semiconductor industry (“Relative Measure”), in each case over the respective three-\nyear performance period. In addition, the PRSUs granted in 2023 (“2023 PRSUs”) and 2024 (“2024 PRSUs”) also include a\nperformance goal related to the Company’s revenue growth over the respective three-year performance period as compared\nto defined targets (“Absolute Measure”) with the actual vesting of the 2023 PRSUs and 2024 PRSUs calculated based on\nhigher achievement under the Relative Measure or the Absolute Measure. Expense associated with these awards, net of\nestimated forfeitures, is recorded throughout the year based on an assessment of the expected achievement of the performance\ntargets. If the performance conditions are not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized\ncompensation is reversed.\nIn February 2024, it was determined that no shares subject to the PRSUs granted in 2021 vested and no shares were\nreleased to the Company’s executives.\n15\nTable of Contents\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nA summary of PRSUs outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and activity during the nine months ended, is presented\nbelow:\nWeighted-Average Aggregate\nWeighted-Average Remaining Intrinsic\nShares Grant Date Fair Contractual Term Value\n(In thousands) Value Per Share (In years) (In thousands)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 256 $ 80.08\nGranted 186 $ 68.30\nVested — —\nForfeited (21) $ 75.24\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 421 $ 75.11 1.42 $ 26,982\nOutstanding and expected to vest at\nSeptember 30, 2024 177 2.25 $ 11,375\nRSU Awards\nA summary of RSUs outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and activity during the nine months ended, is presented\nbelow:\nWeighted-Average Aggregate\nWeighted-Average Remaining Intrinsic\nShares Grant Date Fair Contractual Term Value\n(In thousands) Value Per Share (In years) (In thousands)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 981 $ 70.27\nGranted 424 $ 67.34\nVested (344) $ 63.42\nForfeited (73) $ 73.15\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 988 $ 71.18 1.64 $ 63,360\nOutstanding and expected to vest at\nSeptember 30, 2024 917 1.56 $ 58,824\n8. SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHIC NET REVENUES:\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company is organized and operates as one reportable segment, the design, development, manufacture and\nmarketing of integrated circuits and related components for use primarily in the high-voltage power-conversion market. The\nCompany’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information presented on a\nconsolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.\nCustomer Concentration\nThe Company’s top ten customers accounted for approximately 78% of net revenues for both the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, and 83% and 81% in the corresponding periods of 2023. A significant portion of these\nrevenues are attributable to sales of the Company’s products to distributors of electronic components. These distributors sell\nthe Company’s products to a broad, diverse range of end users, including original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and\nmerchant power-supply manufacturers. Similarly, merchant power-supply manufacturers sell power supplies incorporating the\nCompany’s products to a broad range of OEMs. Sales to distributors were $80.5 million and\n16\nTable of Contents\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n$220.4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $93.2 million and $238.7 million in\nthe corresponding periods of 2023.

In October 2024, the Company’s board of directors\nauthorized the use of $50.0 million for the repurchase of the Company’s common stock, with repurchases to be executed\naccording to pre-defined price/volume guidelines. The program has no expiration date. Authorization of future repurchase\nprograms is at the discretion of the Company’s board of directors and will depend on the Company’s financial condition,\nresults of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors.\nCash Dividends\nIn February 2023, the Company’s board of directors declared dividends of $0.19 per share to be paid to stockholders\nof record at the end of each quarter in 2023.\nIn October 2023, the Company’s board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend with the declaration\nof five cash dividends of $0.20 per share to be paid at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 (in lieu of the previously declared\ndividend of $0.19 per share) and at the end of each quarter in 2024.\nIn October 2024, the Company’s board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend again with the declaration\nof five cash dividends of $0.21 per share to be paid at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024 (in lieu of the previously declared\ndividend of $0.20 per share) and at the end of each quarter in 2025.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash dividends declared and paid were as\nfollows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDividends declared and paid $ 11,364 $ 10,904 $ 34,100 $ 32,665\nDividends declared per common share $ 0.20 $ 0.19 $ 0.60 $ 0.57\n10. EARNINGS PER SHARE:\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average shares of common stock\noutstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average\nshares of common stock and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common equivalent\nshares included in this calculation consist of dilutive shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of outstanding common stock\noptions, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, the assumed issuance of awards under the stock purchase\nplan and contingently issuable performance-based awards, as computed using the treasury stock method.\n18\nTable of Contents\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nA summary of the earnings per share calculation is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic earnings per share:\nNet income $ 14,291 $ 19,796 $ 23,094 $ 41,464\nWeighted-average common shares 56,817 57,383 56,810 57,282\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.25 $ 0.34 $ 0.41 $ 0.72\nDiluted earnings per share: (1)\nNet income $ 14,291 $ 19,796 $ 23,094 $ 41,464\nWeighted-average common shares 56,817 57,383 56,810 57,282\nEffect of dilutive awards:\nEmployee stock plans 187 358 296 429\nDiluted weighted-average common shares 57,004 57,741 57,106 57,711\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.25 $ 0.34 $ 0.40 $ 0.72\n(1) The Company includes the shares underlying performance-based awards in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the\nperformance conditions have been satisfied as of the end of the reporting period and excludes such shares when the necessary\nconditions have not been met. The Company has excluded the shares underlying the outstanding performance-based awards in the 2024\nand 2023 calculations as the shares were not contingently issuable as of the end of the reporting periods.\nIn the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no outstanding stock awards were determined to\nbe anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n11. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES:\nIncome-tax expense includes a provision for federal, state and foreign taxes based on the annual estimated effective\ntax rate applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, adjusted for certain discrete items which are fully recognized in the\nperiod they occur. Accordingly, the interim effective tax rate may not be reflective of the annual estimated effective tax rate.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.3% and 1.5%,\nrespectively, as compared to 5.1% in both corresponding periods of 2023. The effective tax rate in these periods were lower\nthan the statutory federal income-tax rate of 21% due to the geographic distribution of the Company’s world-wide earnings in\nlower-tax jurisdictions and federal research tax credits. Additionally, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany’s effective tax rate was also favorably impacted by the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based\npayments and by discrete items associated with the release of unrecognized tax benefits. In the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company’s effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a discrete item associated with recognition\nof excess tax benefits related to share-based payments. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s\neffective tax rate was also favorably impacted by discrete items associated with the release of unrecognized tax benefits.\nThese benefits were partially offset by U.S. tax on foreign income, known as global intangible low-taxed income. The\nCompany’s primary jurisdiction where foreign earnings are derived is the Cayman Islands, which is a non-taxing jurisdiction.\nIncome earned in other foreign jurisdictions was not material. The Company has not been granted any incentivized tax rates\nand does not operate under any tax holidays in any jurisdiction.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company maintained a valuation allowance on its California deferred tax assets, New\nJersey deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance with respect to its deferred tax assets relating to tax credits in Canada.\nDetermining the consolidated provision for income-tax expense, income-tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and\nliabilities involves judgment. The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which\nit operates, which involves estimating current tax exposures as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of\ndeferred tax assets in each jurisdiction. The estimates used could differ from actual results, which may have a significant\nimpact on operating results in future periods.\n19\nTable of Contents\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n12. COMMITMENTS:\nSupplier Agreements\nUnder the terms of the Company’s wafer-supply agreements with Seiko Epson Corporation (\"Epson\") and ROHM\nLapis Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (\"Lapis\"), the wafers purchased from these suppliers are priced in U.S. dollars, with mutual\nsharing of the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar on future purchases.\nEach year, the Company’s management and these two suppliers review and negotiate future pricing; the negotiated pricing is\ndenominated in U.S. dollars but is subject to contractual exchange-rate provisions. The fluctuation in the exchange rate is\nshared equally between the Company and each of these suppliers on future purchases.\n13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in lawsuits, or customers and\ndistributors may make claims against the Company. In accordance with ASC 450-10, Contingencies, the Company makes a\nprovision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably\nestimated.\nOn December 18, 2019, CogniPower LLC filed a complaint against a customer of the Company in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware for infringement of two patents; the Company thereafter intervened and sought a\ndeclaration of non-infringement with respect to use of the Company’s products. The case was then stayed until February 26,\n2024, when the Delaware Court then set a schedule for the remainder of the case, with further proceedings in the coming\nmonths, and a trial scheduled in August 2025. The Company believes it has strong claims and defenses with respect to all of\nCogniPower’s asserted patents and intends to vigorously defend itself against CogniPower’s claims against the Company’s\ntechnology, with appeals to follow if necessary.\nOn October 31, 2022, Waverly Licensing LLC filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of Texas. In its complaint, Waverly alleged that the Company was infringing one patent\npertaining to charging a battery-operated device. Because the Company believed that Waverly’s Texas complaint was\nimproperly filed in the wrong court, the Company filed a motion to dismiss, and on November 30, 2022, the Company filed a\ncomplaint against Waverly Licensing LLC and related entities IP Edge LLC, Mavexar LLC, and Array IP LLC in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Delaware seeking a declaration of non-infringement with respect to a patent that\nWaverly charged the Company with infringing. The Texas court thereafter dismissed Waverly’s Texas complaint. On March\n12, 2024 the Delaware Court dismissed the remaining case in view of a series of covenants not to sue that the Delaware\ndefendants filed with the Court.\nThe Company is unable to predict the outcome of legal proceedings with certainty, and there can be no assurance that\nthe Company will prevail in the above-mentioned unsettled litigations. These litigations, whether or not determined in the\nCompany’s favor or settled, will be costly and will divert the efforts and attention of the Company’s management and\ntechnical personnel from normal business operations, potentially causing a material adverse effect on the business, financial\ncondition and operating results. Currently, the Company is not able to estimate a loss or a range of loss for the ongoing\nlitigations disclosed above, however adverse determinations in litigation could result in monetary losses, the loss of\nproprietary rights, subject the Company to significant liabilities, require the Company to seek licenses from third parties or\nprevent the Company from licensing the technology, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\n20\nTable of Contents\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n14. INDEMNIFICATIONS:\nThe Company sells products to its distributors under contracts, collectively referred to as Distributor Sales\nAgreements (“DSA”). Each DSA contains the relevant terms of the contractual arrangement with the distributor, and generally\nincludes certain provisions for indemnifying the distributor against losses, expenses, and liabilities from damages that may be\nawarded against the distributor in the event the Company’s products are found to infringe upon a patent, copyright, trademark,\nor other proprietary right of a third party (“Customer Indemnification”). The DSA generally limits the scope of and remedies\nfor the Customer Indemnification obligations in a variety of industry-standard respects, including, but not limited to,\nlimitations based on time and geography, and a right to replace an infringing product. The Company also, from time to time,\nhas granted a specific indemnification right to individual customers.\nThe Company believes its internal development processes and other policies and practices limit its exposure related\nto such indemnifications. In addition, the Company requires its employees to sign a proprietary information and inventions\nagreement, which assigns the rights to its employees’ development work to the Company. To date, the Company has not had to\nreimburse any of its distributors or customers for any losses related to these indemnifications and no material claims were\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024. For several reasons, including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of a\nmonetary liability limit for certain infringement cases, the Company cannot determine the maximum amount of potential\nfuture payments, if any, related to such indemnifications.\n15. ACQUISITION:\nOdyssey Semiconductor Technologies\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company agreed to acquire the assets of Odyssey, a U.S. company and a developer of\nvertical gallium-nitride (“GaN”) transistor technology. The transaction closed on July 1, 2024, at which time all key Odyssey\nemployees joined the Company. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, Odyssey sold, transferred and assigned\nsubstantially all of its assets to the Company for $9.52 million in cash. The purchase is intended to augment the Company’s\ndevelopment of high-power GaN switching technology.\nThe acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with\nASC 805 - Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase consideration of the\nacquisition is allocated to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their relative fair values. The\nexcess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill, the\namount of which represents the expected benefits to the Company of future technology and the knowledgeable and\nexperienced employees who joined the Company. Goodwill is expected to be deductible over 15 years for tax purposes.\nThe following table summarizes the purchase price and estimated fair values of the assets acquired as of July 1, 2024,\nthe completion of the Odyssey acquisition:\n(In thousands) Total Amount\nAssets Acquired\nProperty and equipment, net $ 1,168\nIn-process research and development 4,930\nGoodwill 3,422\nTotal purchase price $ 9,520\nThe fair value of in-process research and development was determined based on the cost approach using the\nCompany’s estimate of the costs that would be incurred if a market participant were to create the acquired technology from\nscratch. The Company considered the number of engineers required, salaries and related benefits, allocated overhead and the\ndevelopment time required to recreate the technology. The Company will record the in-process research and development as\nan intangible asset with an indefinite life until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts,\nand will begin amortizing the value over the estimated life of the technology upon completion of development. Consistent\nwith the treatment of other intangible assets with indefinite lives, the Company will test the in-process research and\ndevelopment for impairment on an annual basis or when impairment indicators are present.\n21\nTable of Contents\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nPro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented because they are not material to the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements.\n22\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis has been prepared as an aid to understanding our financial condition and\nresults of operations. It should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to\nthose statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with the consolidated financial statements\nand management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2024. This discussion contains\nforward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those\ncontained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption “Risk\nFactors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in Part II, Item 1A - “Risk Factors”\nand elsewhere in this report. See also “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this\nreport.\nOverview\nWe design, develop and market analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (“ICs”) and other electronic components\nand circuitry used in high-voltage power conversion. Our products are used in power converters that convert electricity from a\nhigh-voltage source to the type of power required for a specified downstream use. In most cases, this conversion entails,\namong other functions, converting alternating current (“AC”) to direct current (“DC”) or vice versa, reducing or increasing the\nvoltage, and regulating the output voltage and/or current according to the customer’s specifications.\nA large percentage of our products are ICs used in AC-DC power supplies, which convert the high-voltage AC from a\nwall outlet to the low-voltage DC required by most electronic devices. Power supplies incorporating our products are used\nwith all manner of electronic products including appliances, computing and networking equipment, mobile phones, electronic\nutility meters, battery-powered tools, industrial controls, and “home-automation,” or “internet of things” applications such as\nnetworked thermostats, power strips and security devices. Variations of our power-supply ICs are used for high-voltage power\nconversion in electric vehicles (“EVs”). We also supply high-voltage LED drivers, which are AC-DC ICs specifically\ndesigned for lighting applications that utilize light-emitting diodes, and motor-driver ICs for brushless DC (“BLDC”) motors\nused in consumer appliances, HVAC systems, ceiling fans and a variety of industrial applications.\nWe also offer high-voltage gate drivers—either standalone ICs or circuit boards containing ICs, electrical isolation\ncomponents and other circuitry—used to operate high-voltage switches such as insulated-gate bipolar transistors (“IGBTs”)\nand silicon-carbide (“SiC”) MOSFETs. These combinations of switches and drivers are used for power conversion in high-\npower applications (i.e., power levels ranging from approximately 100 kilowatts up to gigawatts) such as industrial motors,\nsolar- and wind-power systems, locomotives, EVs and high-voltage DC transmission systems.\nOur power-conversion products are distinguished by their “system-level” nature; that is, they incorporate into a single\nproduct numerous elements of a power-conversion system including a high-voltage transistor, drivers, advanced control\ncircuitry and, in some cases, a communication link connecting the primary (i.e., input) and secondary (i.e., output) sides of the\npower converter while maintaining safety isolation to protect the end user from exposure to high voltage. Alternatively, a\npower converter can be designed and assembled using discrete components purchased from a variety of suppliers.\nOur system-level products offer a number of important benefits compared with discrete designs, including: reduced\ndesign complexity; smaller size; lower component count, which in turn results in higher reliability and easier sourcing of\ncomponents; reduced time-to-market; and more efficient use of engineering resources. Our products also reduce the energy\nconsumption of power converters during normal use and in “standby” operation, when the end product is not in use. In\naddition to the environmental and economic benefits of reduced energy usage, our energy-saving technologies provide a\nnumber of benefits to our customers; these include helping them meet the increasingly stringent efficiency standards now in\neffect for many electronic products, and enabling the elimination of bulky, costly heatsinks used to dissipate the heat produced\nby wasted electricity. By reducing component count, circuit-board size and the need for heatsinks, our products also contribute\nto a reduction in materials usage and electronic waste.\n23\nTable of Contents\nWhile the size of our addressable market fluctuates with changes in macroeconomic and industry conditions, the\nmarket has generally exhibited a modest growth rate over time as growth in the unit volume of power converters has been\noffset to a large degree by reductions in the average selling price of components in this market. Therefore, the growth of our\nbusiness depends largely on increasing our penetration of the markets that we serve and on further expanding our addressable\nmarket. Our growth strategy includes the following elements:\n● Increase our penetration of the markets we serve. We currently address AC-DC applications with power\noutputs up to approximately 500 watts, gate-driver applications ranging from approximately 100 kilowatts\nup to gigawatts, and motor-drive applications up to approximately one horsepower. Through our research\nand development efforts, we seek to introduce more advanced products for these markets offering higher\nlevels of integration and performance compared to earlier products. We also continue to expand our sales\nand application-engineering staff and our network of distributors, as well as our offerings of technical\ndocumentation and design-support tools and services to help customers use our products. These tools and\nservices include our PI Expert™ design software, which we offer free of charge, and our transformer-\nsample service. In 2022 we launched PowerPros℠, a live online video support service that enables power-\nsupply designers to talk directly with members of our applications engineering team 24 hours a day, six\ndays a week, anywhere in the world.\n● Capitalize on efforts to reduce carbon emissions by providing products that contribute to improved energy\nefficiency and increased use of renewable energy. In its 2019 World Energy Outlook, the International\nEnergy Agency estimated that more than two-thirds of the reduction in carbon-dioxide (“CO2”) emissions\nneeded to achieve the “Sustainable Development Scenario” of the United Nations Sustainable Development\nAgenda is to come from improved energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy. Energy savings\nenabled by our products help our customers comply with regulations that seek to curb energy consumption\nin support of reducing CO2 emissions. For example: our EcoSmart™ technology drastically reduces the\namount of energy consumed by electronic products when they are plugged in but not in use; our\nPowiGaN™ gallium-nitride (“GaN”) transistors reduce energy consumption compared to silicon transistors;\nand our BridgeSwitch™ motor-driver ICs provide highly efficient power conversion for BLDC motors in\nappliances and industrial applications. Also, our gate-driver products are critical components in energy-\nefficient DC motor drives, solar- and wind-power systems, efficient high-voltage DC transmission systems\n(including transmission of energy from renewable energy installations to the power grid), and low-\nemissions transportation applications such as electric locomotives.\n● Increase the size of our addressable market. Prior to 2010 our addressable market consisted of AC-DC\napplications with up to about 50 watts of output, a served available market (“SAM”) opportunity of\napproximately $1.5 billion. Since then we have expanded our SAM to approximately $4 billion through a\nvariety of means. These include the introduction of products that enable us to address higher-power AC-DC\napplications (such as our Hiper™ product families), the introduction of LED-driver products, and our entry\ninto the gate-driver market through the acquisition of CT-Concept Technologie AG in 2012. In 2016 we\nintroduced the SCALE-iDriverTM family of ICs, broadening the range of gate-driver applications we can\naddress. In 2018 we introduced our BridgeSwitch™ motor-driver ICs for BLDC motors; in 2024 we\nintroduced BridgeSwitch-2, which expands our addressable power range of motor-drive applications. We\nhave introduced a range of automotive-qualified products to address the EV market; we expect to introduce\nmore such products in the future, and expect automotive applications to become a significant portion of our\nSAM over time.\nAlso contributing to our SAM expansion has been the emergence of new applications within the power\nranges that our products can address. For example, applications such as “smart” utility meters, battery-\npowered lawn equipment and bicycles, and USB power receptacles (often installed alongside traditional AC\nwall outlets) can incorporate our products. The increased use of connectivity, LED lighting and other power-\nconsuming electronic features in consumer appliances has also enhanced our SAM.\nWe have also expanded our SAM through the development of technologies and architectures that increase\nthe value (and therefore the average selling prices) of our products. For example, our InnoSwitch™ ICs\nintegrate circuitry from the secondary, or low-voltage, side of AC-DC power supplies,\n24\nTable of Contents\nwhereas earlier product families integrated circuitry only on the primary, or high-voltage side. Our\nInnoMux™ IC families provide up to three DC outputs, eliminating the need for additional power-\nmanagement circuitry in certain end products requiring multiple voltages while significantly increasing\nefficiency. In 2019 we began incorporating our proprietary GaN transistors in some of our products,\nenabling a higher level of energy efficiency than ICs with silicon transistors. Since then, we have introduced\na variety of new products utilizing GaN technology, as well as new generations of our GaN technology\ncapable of supporting higher voltages (as high as 1700 volts). We are currently developing new products\nincorporating these technologies, which we believe will enable us to address higher-power applications than\nwe address with our current range of products and therefore further expand our SAM.\nWe intend to continue expanding our SAM in the years ahead through all of the means described above.\nOur quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuations. We plan our production\nand inventory levels based on internal forecasts of projected customer demand, which are highly unpredictable and can\nfluctuate substantially. Customers typically may cancel or reschedule orders on short notice without significant penalty and,\nconversely, often place orders with very short lead times to delivery. Also, external factors such as supply-chain dynamics,\nwidespread health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, and macroeconomic conditions including inflation, fluctuations\nin interest and exchange rates and bank failures, have caused and can continue to cause our operating results to be volatile.\nFurthermore, because our industry is intensely price-sensitive, our gross margin (gross profit divided by net revenues) is\nsubject to change based on the relative pricing of solutions that compete with ours. Variations in product mix, end-market mix\nand customer mix can also cause our gross margin to fluctuate. Because we purchase a large percentage of our silicon wafers\nfrom foundries located in Japan, our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar\nand the Japanese yen. Changes in the prices of raw materials used in our products, such as copper and gold, can also affect our\ngross margin. Although our wafer fabrication and assembly operations are outsourced, as are most of our test operations, a\nportion of our production costs are fixed in nature. As a result, our unit costs and gross margin are impacted by the volume of\nunits we produce.\nRecent Results\nOur net revenues were $115.8 million and $125.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $313.7 million and $355.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\ndecrease in net revenues for the three-month period was driven primarily by lower sales of our products for use in smartphone\nchargers, reflecting greater use of Chinese-made components in chargers manufactured for Chinese smartphone vendors, as\nwell as increased decoupling of handsets and chargers. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales into the consumer\nand computer end-markets reflecting, respectively, the depletion of excess inventories related to the appliance market and the\nincreased use of our products in chargers for notebook computers and other mobile devices. For the nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, revenues for all but the consumer end-market category decreased compared to the corresponding prior-\nyear period.\nIn general, we believe that demand for our products has been negatively affected in recent periods by macroeconomic\nand geopolitical factors including reduced consumer spending and a reduction in home sales in response to inflation and\nhigher interest rates, general economic weakness in China, weaker industrial activity and the conflicts in Ukraine and the\nMiddle East. We believe these factors have exacerbated the effects of a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry; such\ndownturns are commonly experienced following periods of strong growth during which supply-chain participants tend to\naccumulate excess inventories.\nOur top ten customers, including distributors that resell to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers,\naccounted for 78% of net revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 83% and 81% in the\ncorresponding periods of 2023. International sales accounted for 98% of our net revenues for both the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, and 98% in both the corresponding periods of 2023.\nOur gross margin was 55% and 53% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 53%\nand 52% for the corresponding nine-month periods. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to favorable end-market\nmix, with a greater percentage of revenues coming from the higher-margin industrial and consumer end-markets, and the\nfavorable impact of the dollar/yen exchange rate on our wafer costs.\nTotal operating expenses were $51.6 million and $48.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and $153.5 million and $146.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\n25\nTable of Contents\nrespectively. The increase in operating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods was primarily due to higher stock-based\ncompensation expense related to performance-based awards, and higher salaries and related expenses driven by higher\nheadcount and annual salary increases. Partially offsetting these increases for the nine-month period were decreased product-\ndevelopment expenses. In addition, we recognized a credit in the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to the\nrecovery of bad debt.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate\nour estimates, including those listed below. We base our estimates on historical facts and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and\nrequire us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no material changes\nto our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and Note 2, Significant Accounting\nPolicies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in each case in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2024. Currently, our only critical accounting policies relate to revenue\nrecognition and estimating write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet revenues 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nCost of revenues 45.5 47.5 46.6 48.5\nGross profit 54.5 52.5 53.4 51.5\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 22.3 19.2 23.9 20.4\nSales and marketing 14.8 12.9 16.2 13.8\nGeneral and administrative 7.5 6.3 8.8 7.0\nTotal operating expenses 44.6 38.4 48.9 41.2\nIncome from operations 9.9 14.1 4.5 10.3\nOther income 2.4 2.5 3.0 2.1\nIncome before income taxes 12.3 16.6 7.5 12.4\nProvision for income taxes — 0.8 0.1 0.6\nNet income 12.3% 15.8% 7.4% 11.8%\nComparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nNet revenues. Net revenues consist of revenues from product sales, which are calculated net of returns and\nallowances. Net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $115.8 million and $313.7 million,\nrespectively, and $125.5 million and $355.0 million, in the corresponding periods of 2023. The decrease in net revenues for\nthe three-month period was driven primarily by lower sales of our products for use in smartphone chargers, reflecting greater\nuse of Chinese-made components in chargers manufactured for Chinese smartphone vendors, as well as increased decoupling\nof handsets and chargers. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales into the consumer and computer end-markets\nreflecting, respectively, the depletion of excess inventories related to the appliance market and increased use of our products in\nchargers for notebook computers and other mobile devices. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, revenues\nfor all but the consumer end-market category decreased compared to the corresponding prior-year period.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOur revenue mix by end market for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nEnd Market 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCommunications 12% 32% 11% 30%\nComputer 14% 10% 14% 12%\nConsumer 38% 26% 40% 26%\nIndustrial 36% 32% 35% 32%\nInternational sales, consisting of sales outside of the United States of America based on “bill to” customer locations,\nwere $114.1 million and $308.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and\n$123.3 million and $348.1 million in the corresponding periods of 2023. Although power converters using our products are\ndistributed to end markets worldwide, most are manufactured in Asia. As a result, sales to this region represented 85% and\n84% of our net revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 84% in both the\ncorresponding periods of 2023. We expect international sales, and sales to the Asia region in particular, to continue to account\nfor a large portion of our net revenues in the future.\nSales to distributors accounted for 70% of our net revenues in both the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 74% and 67% in the corresponding periods of 2023. Direct sales to OEMs and power-supply\nmanufacturers accounted for the remainder.\nThe following customers represented 10% or more of our net revenues for the respective periods:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nCustomer 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAvnet 31% 28% 30% 26%\nHonestar Technologies Co., Ltd. 10% 23% 11% 17%\nSalcomp Group * * * 11%\n*Total customer revenue was less than 10% of net revenues.\nNo other customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in these periods.\nGross profit. Gross profit is net revenues less cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the\npurchase of wafers from our contracted foundries, the assembly, packaging and testing of our products by sub-contractors,\nproduct testing performed in our own facility, overhead associated with the management of our supply chain. Gross margin is\ngross profit divided by net revenues. The following table compares gross profit and gross margin for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet revenues $ 115.8 $ 125.5 $ 313.7 $ 355.0\nGross profit $ 63.2 $ 65.9 $ 167.5 $ 182.7\nGross margin 54.5% 52.5% 53.4% 51.5%\nThe increase in gross margin was primarily due to favorable end-market mix, with a greater percentage of revenues\ncoming from the higher-margin industrial and consumer end-markets, and the favorable impact of the dollar/yen exchange rate\non our wafer costs.\n27\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of employee-\nrelated expenses, including stock-based compensation, and expensed material and facility costs associated with the\ndevelopment of new technologies and products. We also record R&D expenses for prototype wafers related to new products\nuntil such products are released to production. The table below compares R&D expenses for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nR&D expenses $ 25.8 $ 24.1 $ 75.1 $ 72.6\nHeadcount (at period end) 319 290 319 290\nR&D expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding\nperiods of 2023. The increase for the three-month period was primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses driven by\nhigher headcount and annual salary increases, as well as increased product-development expenses. The increase for the nine-\nmonth period was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based awards, as well as\nhigher salaries and related expenses driven by higher headcount and annual salary increases. These increases were partially\noffset by decreased product-development expenses.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing (“S&M”) expenses consist primarily of employee-related\nexpenses, including stock-based compensation, commissions to sales representatives, amortization of intangible assets and\nfacilities expenses, including expenses associated with our regional sales and support offices. The table below compares S&M\nexpenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSales and marketing expenses $ 17.1 $ 16.2 $ 50.9 $ 49.1\nHeadcount (at period end) 325 320 325 320\nS&M expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding\nperiods of 2023, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based awards, as well as\nhigher salaries and related expenses driven by higher headcount and annual salary increases.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses consist primarily of employee-\nrelated expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for administration, finance, human resources and general\nmanagement, as well as consulting, professional services, legal and audit expenses. The table below compares G&A expenses\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nG&A expenses $ 8.6 $ 7.9 $ 27.5 $ 25.0\nHeadcount (at period end) 78 73 78 73\nG&A expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding\nperiods of 2023, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based awards, as well as\nhigher salaries and related expenses due to annual salary increases. The increase was partially offset for the three months due\nto a credit related to the recovery of bad debt.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOther income. Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents, marketable\nsecurities and other investments, and the impact of foreign exchange gains or losses. The table below compares other income\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOther income $ 2.8 $ 3.1 $ 9.4 $ 7.6\nOther income decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of\n2023, as higher interest income driven by higher rates on investments was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign\nexchange rates during the period. Other income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\ncorresponding period of 2023, primarily due to higher interest income.\nProvision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes represents federal, state and foreign taxes. The table below\ncompares income-tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nProvision for income taxes $ — $ 1.1 $ 0.4 $ 2.2\nEffective tax rate 0.3% 5.1% 1.5% 5.1%\nIncome-tax expense includes a provision for federal, state and foreign taxes based on the annual estimated effective\ntax rate applicable to us and our subsidiaries, adjusted for certain discrete items which are fully recognized in the period in\nwhich they occur. Accordingly, the interim effective tax rate may not be reflective of the annual estimated effective tax rate.\nOur effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.3% and 1.5%, respectively, as\ncompared to 5.1% in both the corresponding periods of 2023. The effective tax rate in these periods was lower than the\nstatutory federal income-tax rate of 21% due to the geographic distribution of our world-wide earnings in lower-tax\njurisdictions and the impact of federal research tax credits. Additionally, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our\neffective tax rate was also favorably impacted by the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments and by\ndiscrete items associated with the release of unrecognized tax benefits. In the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a discrete item associated with recognition of excess tax benefits\nrelated to share-based payments. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our effective tax rate was also favorably\nimpacted by discrete items associated with the release of unrecognized tax benefits. These benefits were partially offset by\nU.S. tax on foreign income, known as global intangible low-taxed income. The primary jurisdiction from which our foreign\nearnings are derived is the Cayman Islands, which is a non-taxing jurisdiction. Income earned in other foreign jurisdictions\nwas not material. We have not been granted any incentivized tax rates and do not operate under any tax holidays in any\njurisdiction.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $303.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, a\ndecrease of $7.8 million from $311.6 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital,\ndefined as current assets less current liabilities, of $457.1 million, a decrease of approximately $5.6 million from\n$462.7 million as of December 31, 2023.\nWe have a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the \"Credit Agreement\") that provides us\nwith a $75.0 million revolving line of credit to use for general corporate purposes with a $20.0 million sub-limit for the\nissuance of standby and trade letters of credit. The Credit Agreement was amended on June 7, 2021, to provide an alternate\nborrowing rate as a replacement for LIBOR and extend the termination date from April 30, 2022, to June 7, 2026, with all\nother terms remaining the same. The Credit Agreement was amended with an effective date of June 28, 2023 to include the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rates (“SOFR”) as interest rate benchmark rates, with all other terms remaining the same. Our\nability to borrow under the revolving line of credit is conditioned upon our compliance with specified covenants, including\nreporting and financial covenants, primarily a minimum liquidity measure and a debt to earnings ratio, with which we are\ncurrently in compliance. The Credit Agreement terminates on June 7, 2026; any advances under the\n29\nTable of Contents\nrevolving line of credit would become due on such date, or earlier in the event of a default. No advances were outstanding\nunder the agreement as of September 30, 2024.\nCash from Operating Activities\nOperating activities generated $66.5 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net income for\nthis period was $23.1 million; we also incurred non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, increase in\ndeferred tax assets, accretion of discount on marketable securities, and amortization of intangibles of $25.8 million,\n$25.6 million, $8.7 million, $1.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Sources of cash included a $5.6 million decrease in\nprepaid expenses and other assets and an increase of $1.9 million in accounts payable. These sources of cash were partially\noffset by a $4.5 million increase in inventories and a $1.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to timing of customer\npayments.\nOperating activities generated $49.5 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for\nthis period was $41.5 million; we also incurred depreciation, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, increase in\ndeferred tax assets and amortization of intangibles of $26.3 million, $21.0 million, $10.0 million and $1.6 million,\nrespectively. Sources of cash were partially offset by a $14.8 million increase in inventories reflecting a slowdown in sales\ndriven by factors described above, a $7.2 million increase in accounts receivable, a $5.0 million decrease in taxes payable and\naccrued liabilities primarily due to timing of customer rebate payments, a $2.9 million decrease in accounts payable\n(excluding payables related to property and equipment) due to timing of payments and a $0.8 million increase in prepaid\nexpenses and other assets primarily due to federal income tax prepayments.\nCash from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in a $17.5 million net use of cash,\nprimarily consisting of $14.2 million used for purchases of property and equipment (primarily production-related machinery\nand equipment) and $9.5 million for the Odyssey acquisition, partially offset by $6.2 million of proceeds from sales and\nmaturities of marketable securities, net of purchases.\nOur investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in $25.9 million net use of cash,\nprimarily consisting of $11.1 million used for purchases of marketable securities net of proceeds from sales and maturities,\nand $14.7 million used for purchases of property and equipment, primarily production-related machinery and equipment.\nCash from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in a $54.4 million net use of cash,\nconsisting of $34.1 million for the payment of dividends to stockholders and $26.0 million for the repurchase of our common\nstock, partially offset by proceeds of $5.7 million from the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.\nOur financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in a $34.3 million net use of cash,\nconsisting of $32.7 million for the payment of dividends to stockholders and $7.8 million for the repurchase of our common\nstock, partially offset by $6.2 million from the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.\nDividends\nIn February 2023, our board of directors declared dividends of $0.19 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at\nthe end of each quarter in 2023. In October 2023, our board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend with the declaration\nof five cash dividends of $0.20 per share to be paid at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 (in lieu of the previously declared\ndividend of $0.19 per share) and at the end of each quarter in 2024. In October 2024, our board of directors raised the\nquarterly cash dividend again with the declaration of five cash dividends of $0.21 per share to be paid at the end of the fourth\nquarter of 2024 (in lieu of the previously declared dividend of $0.20 per share) and at the end of each quarter in 2025.\nDividend payouts of $11.4 million occurred on March 28, 2024, June 28, 2024 and September 30, 2024. The\ndeclaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our financial condition,\nresults of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash\ndividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.\n30\nTable of Contents\nStock Repurchases\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $26.0 million remaining under our stock-repurchase program. We exhausted this\nauthorization in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, purchasing approximately 371,000 shares of our common stock\nfor $26.0 million. In October 2024, our board of directors authorized the use of $50.0 million for the repurchase of our\ncommon stock, with repurchases to be executed according to pre-defined price/volume guidelines. The program has no\nexpiration date. Authorization of future repurchase programs is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on\nour financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors.\nContractual Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our contractual commitments from those reported in\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOther Information\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may change in future periods due to changes in our planned cash\noutlays, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to future acquisitions. Current U.S.\ntax laws generally allow companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal taxes.\nAccordingly, as of September 30, 2024, our worldwide cash and marketable securities are available to fund capital allocation\nneeds, including capital and internal investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases and/or dividends without incurring\nadditional U.S. federal income taxes.\nIf our operating results deteriorate in future periods, either as a result of a decrease in customer demand or pricing\npressures from our customers or our competitors, or for other reasons, our ability to generate positive cash flow from\noperations may be jeopardized. In that case, we may be forced to use our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments,\nuse our current financing or seek additional financing from third parties to fund our operations. We believe that cash generated\nfrom operations, together with existing sources of liquidity, will satisfy our projected working capital and other cash\nrequirements for at least the next 12 months. Our uses of cash beyond the next 12 months will depend on many factors,\nincluding the general economic environment in which we operate and our ability to generate cash flow from operations, which\nare uncertain but include funding our operations and additional capital expenditures.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation with respect to this item may be found in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting\nPronouncements, in our Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere have been no material changes to our interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk during the first nine\nmonths of 2024. For a discussion of our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk, refer to our market\nrisk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2023\nForm 10-K.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nLimitation on Effectiveness of Controls\nAny control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance as to the\ntested objectives. The design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future\nevents, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future\nconditions, regardless of how remote. The inherent limitations in any control system include the realities that judgments\nrelated to decision-making can be faulty, and that reduced effectiveness in controls can occur because of simple errors or\nmistakes. Due to the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error may occur and may not\nbe detected.\n31\nTable of Contents\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement is required to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-\n15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and\nother procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under\nthe Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures\ninclude controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer), our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded\nthat our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were\neffective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024,\nthat have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results is included with the tables accompanying this press release. \n\nCommented Balu Balakrishnan, chairman and CEO of Power Integrations: “Our third-quarter results were on target, and while our outlook reflects soft end-market demand, particularly in consumer appliances, we nevertheless expect double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. In light of our strong balance sheet, our board of directors has authorized $50 million for share repurchases and increased our quarterly dividend by five percent. \n\n“Progress on our PowiGaN™ technology roadmap continues apace, with the introduction earlier this week of the world’s first 1700-volt gallium-nitride transistors in our InnoMux™-2 product family. As PowiGaN technology reaches ever-higher voltage and power capabilities, it becomes an increasingly attractive, lower-cost alternative to silicon carbide. At the same time, its cost is approaching parity with the most advanced high-voltage silicon MOSFETs, but with far superior performance.” \n\n**Additional Highlights**\n\n  * Power Integrations’ board of directors has authorized the use of $50 million for the repurchase of the company’s common shares, subject to pre-determined price/volume thresholds. The authorization does not have an expiration date. \n  * The company paid a dividend of $0.20 per share on September 30, 2024; a dividend of $0.21 per share will be paid on December 31, 2024, to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nThe company issued the following forecast for the fourth quarter of 2024: \n\n  * Revenues are expected to be $105 million plus or minus $5 million. \n  * GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 54 percent and 54.5 percent, and non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 55 percent and 55.5 percent. The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins is approximately equally attributable to stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. \n  * GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $53.5 million and $54 million; non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $44.5 million and $45 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to exclude approximately $9 million of stock-based compensation. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call Today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time**\n\nPower Integrations management will hold a conference call today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time.

The company’s products are key building blocks in the clean-power ecosystem, enabling the generation of renewable energy as well as the efficient transmission and consumption of power in applications ranging from milliwatts to megawatts. For more information, please visit [ _www.power.com_ ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.power.com&esheet=54148291&newsitemid=20241106320623&lan=en-US&anchor=www.power.com&index=5&md5=18a6af4803a3abd191640fce71107b3c). \n\n**Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the company's consolidated financial statements, which are presented according to GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information that excludes stock-based compensation expenses recorded under ASC 718-10, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the tax effects of these items. The company uses these measures in its financial and operational decision-making and, with respect to one measure, in setting performance targets for compensation purposes. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures offer important analytical tools to help investors understand its operating results, and to facilitate comparability with the results of companies that provide similar measures. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. For example, stock-based compensation is an important component of the company’s compensation mix and will continue to result in significant expenses in the company’s GAAP results for the foreseeable future but is not reflected in the non-GAAP measures. Also, other companies, including companies in Power Integrations’ industry, may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are attached to this press release. \n\n**Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThe above statements regarding the company’s forecast for its fourth-quarter financial performance are forward-looking statements reflecting management's current expectations and beliefs. These statements are based on current information that is, by its nature, subject to rapid and even abrupt change. Due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, actual results could differ materially from those projected or implied by these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the company’s ability to supply products and its ability to conduct other aspects of its business such as competing for new design wins; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, including such factors as inflation, armed conflicts and trade negotiations, which may impact the level of demand for the company’s products; potential changes and shifts in customer demand away from end products that utilize the company's integrated circuits to end products that do not incorporate the company's products; the effects of competition, which may cause the company’s revenues to decrease or cause the company to decrease its selling prices for its products; unforeseen costs and expenses; and unfavorable fluctuations in component costs or operating expenses resulting from changes in commodity prices and/or exchange rates. In addition, new product introductions and design wins are subject to the risks and uncertainties that typically accompany development and delivery of complex technologies to the marketplace, including product development delays and defects and market acceptance of the new products. These and other risk factors that may cause actual results to differ are more fully explained under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2024. The company is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. \n\n_Power Integrations, PowiGaN, InnoMux and the Power Integrations logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Power Integrations, Inc.

          "content": "2023 Annual Report\n\nDear Fellow Stockholders,\nIn my letter last year, I addressed the cyclical downturn that began in mid-2022 and led to a seven-percent decline in our\nrevenues in that year after growth of more than 40 percent in 2021. The downturn deepened in 2023, causing our revenues\nto fall by more than 30 percent—the first time in our history that revenues have declined in back-to-back years. In more\nthan forty-five years in the semiconductor industry I have learned that all cycles are different, and this one is certainly\nunlike any other. As you may remember, the coronavirus pandemic resulted in an unprecedented surge in demand for\nelectronic goods—computer and networking equipment for remote work and school, TVs, appliances, etc., leading to\nmuch-publicized shortages of semiconductor products. This in turn led to over-ordering at every link in the supply chain,\nand once supply caught up with demand and those orders were filled, the supply chain was suddenly awash in inventory.\nLayered on top of this inventory overshoot has been a macroeconomic slowdown dampening demand and hindering the\ndepletion of inventories. Economic challenges in China have severely impacted domestic demand in that country, while\ninflation and higher interest rates have negatively affected consumer spending and home sales in markets around the world.\nMoreover, after having purchased new appliances, computers and other products during the pandemic, consumers of late\nhave prioritized spending on travel, dining and entertainment rather than physical goods.\nWhile macroeconomic challenges remain a concern, inventories throughout the supply chain have fallen significantly in\nrecent months, and we expect a gradual recovery beginning in the first half of 2024. Most importantly, we remain as excited\nas ever about our long-term growth opportunities. We have managed through this downturn according to the playbook that\nhas served us well in the past, looking beyond the cycle and remaining focused on the long run. That includes building\nwafer inventory to protect our dedicated foundry capacity and to be prepared in the event of a strong upturn, buying back\nshares of our stock at opportune moments, and carefully managing expenses while investing in technologies and products\nto drive revenue growth and expand our served available market (“SAM”) over the next several years.\nOne such growth driver is our high-power gate-driver business, which had a second consecutive year of growth in 2023\neven as revenues from the broader industrial category were down almost 40 percent. Renewable energy is an important\npiece of our high-power business, and we had significant wins last year not only in the utility-scale solar and wind markets\nbut also in the adjacent high-voltage DC transmission market. In July we announced that our gate drivers will be used in\nan undersea link connecting a North Sea wind farm to the mainland, and later in the year we received an initial multi-\nmillion-dollar purchase order for that design as the project prepares to ramp up in 2024.\nAnother bright spot in 2023 was India, where revenues increased year-over-year and where we are deploying more sales\nand application-engineering resources. Growth in India is not just a result of manufacturing moving out of China, but also\na rising level of in-country design and production for the domestic market, which features a rapidly expanding middle class\nand modernizing infrastructure. We are participating in a number of ways, with significant design wins in 5G fixed\nwireless, smart utility meters, and appliances including ceiling fans, which are converting to brushless DC motors utilizing\nour BridgeSwitch™ motor-drive ICs. We also have a strong pipeline of design opportunities in electric transportation, in\neverything from two-wheelers to buses and locomotives.\nElectrification of transportation is among the most important opportunities we are addressing, and we made tremendous\nprogress in 2023, racking up wins and expanding our design pipeline in high-voltage EV applications such as drivetrain\nemergency power, 12-volt battery replacement and micro-DC-DC converters. Our automotive-qualified products are\nextremely well suited for these applications, which not only require high efficiency but also benefit from the reliability and\nspace savings of our low-component-count designs. Our pipeline of EV design opportunities expanded significantly in\n2023, and as of year-end eight car brands were shipping vehicles using our ICs. We expect many more designs to start\nproduction in 2024.\nAnother 2023 success story was our proprietary gallium-nitride technology, known as PowiGaN™. We are full-speed-\nahead on GaN development, more confident than ever that GaN will not only overtake silicon as the technology of choice\nfor most high-voltage applications but will also be a greener, more cost-effective alternative to the other major “wide-\nbandgap” semiconductor technology—silicon carbide, or SiC—over the long term. GaN has significant cost advantages\nover SiC in the voltage and power ranges that it can address, and we expect the overlap between the two technologies to\nincrease over time as we further develop PowiGaN technology and introduce more products incorporating GaN switches.\nMost GaN suppliers rely on the technology of one particular foundry, leaving little room for differentiation and affording\nthem no control over the technology roadmap. In contrast, our GaN is proprietary, which means that we not only control\nthe roadmap, but also that we can tailor our GaN switches for optimal system performance in each application. Our GaN\ntechnology is also unique, with characteristics that make it better suited for higher voltages than other technologies in the\nmarket today.\nLast March we introduced a new version of our InnoSwitch™ products featuring a 900-volt PowiGaN switch, and in\nNovember we took the next step on the roadmap with the introduction of 1250-volt technology. Higher-voltage InnoSwitch\nICs are ideal for many industrial applications and for geographies with unstable mains voltages, as well as power supplies\nin 400-volt EVs. These higher-voltage GaN technologies will also enable us to expand our SAM with new products that\naddress applications up to about 10 kilowatts, such as power supplies for servers (including AI servers),\ntelecommunications equipment, EV on-board chargers and a range of industrial applications.\nSome of these applications are served today by silicon carbide because there is no viable alternative that delivers the\nnecessary level of efficiency. However, GaN is fundamentally more cost-effective than SiC because it uses lower-cost raw\nmaterials and requires a tiny fraction of the energy needed to produce SiC, which is processed at extremely high\ntemperatures. That also makes GaN a more sustainable technology than SiC, which squanders a portion of its efficiency\nbenefits in its own manufacture.\nOur GaN roadmap does not end at 1250 volts. We expect to introduce even higher-voltage GaN in the near future, and our\nlonger-term vision includes the potential to drive the power capabilities of GaN beyond 10 kilowatts, making it a viable\nreplacement for SiC in an even wider range of applications.\nGaN also features prominently in the roadmap for BridgeSwitch™ motor-drive products—another key pillar of our growth\nstrategy. Current BridgeSwitch products, covering applications up to about 400 watts, are gaining adoption at customers\nin major appliances as well as air conditioners and ceiling fans. Future BridgeSwitch products, including some with GaN\ntransistors, will address higher power levels, more than doubling the current SAM for motor-drive products.\nIn addition to exceptional efficiency in active mode, BridgeSwitch offers very low standby consumption, which is\nattracting strong interest from appliance customers in light of upcoming changes in the European EcoDesign efficiency\nstandards. The allowable standby consumption for a wide range of electronic products will be reduced beginning in 2025,\nand we expect the new standards to be especially impactful in the appliance market. The low standby performance of\nBridgeSwitch perfectly complements our EcoSmart™ technology, which has helped us win a healthy market share in\nappliance auxiliary power supplies. In September we introduced our latest EcoSmart product, LinkSwitch™-XT2SR,\nwhich offers no-load consumption of less than five milliwatts. In all, we estimate that EcoSmart technology saved nearly\n15 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2023—an amount roughly equivalent to the annual consumption of two million homes.\nThank you for your continued support of our company—I look forward to reporting on our progress in the year ahead.\nSincerely,\nBalu Balakrishnan\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nMarch 2024\nThe statements in this Annual Report relating to future events or results are forward-looking statements that involve many risks and uncertainties.

Business.\nOverview\nWe design, develop and market analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (“ICs”) and other electronic\ncomponents and circuitry used in high-voltage power conversion. Our products are used in power converters that convert\nelectricity from a high-voltage source to the type of power required for a specified downstream use. In most cases, this\nconversion entails, among other functions, converting alternating current (“AC”) to direct current (“DC”) or vice versa,\nreducing or increasing the voltage, and regulating the output voltage and/or current according to the customer’s\nspecifications.\nA large percentage of our products are ICs used in AC-DC power supplies, which convert the high-voltage AC\nfrom a wall outlet to the low-voltage DC required by most electronic devices. Power supplies incorporating our products\nare used with all manner of electronic products including mobile phones, computing and networking equipment,\nappliances, electronic utility meters, battery-powered tools, industrial controls, and “home-automation,” or “internet of\nthings” applications such as networked thermostats, power strips and security devices. Variations of our power-supply ICs\nare used for high-voltage power conversion in electric vehicles (“EVs”). We also supply high-voltage LED drivers, which\nare AC-DC ICs specifically designed for lighting applications that utilize light-emitting diodes, and motor-driver ICs for\nbrushless DC (“BLDC”) motors used in consumer appliances, HVAC systems, ceiling fans and a variety of industrial\napplications.\nWe also offer high-voltage gate drivers—either standalone ICs or circuit boards containing ICs, electrical\nisolation components and other circuitry—used to operate high-voltage switches such as insulated-gate bipolar transistors\n(“IGBTs”) and silicon-carbide (“SiC”) MOSFETs. These combinations of switches and drivers are used for power\nconversion in high-power applications (i.e., power levels ranging from approximately 100 kilowatts up to gigawatts) such\nas industrial motors, solar- and wind-power systems, EVs and high-voltage DC transmission systems.\nOur power-conversion products are distinguished by their “system-level” nature; that is, they incorporate into a\nsingle product numerous elements of a power-conversion system including a high-voltage transistor, drivers, advanced\ncontrol circuitry and, in some cases, a communication link connecting the primary (i.e., input) and secondary (i.e., output)\nsides of the power converter while maintaining safety isolation to protect the end user from exposure to high voltage.\nAlternatively, a power converter can be designed and assembled using discrete components purchased from a variety of\nsuppliers.\nOur system-level products offer a number of important benefits compared with discrete designs, including:\nreduced design complexity; smaller size; lower component count, which in turn results in higher reliability and easier\nsourcing of components; reduced time-to-market; and more efficient use of engineering resources. Our products also\nreduce the energy consumption of power converters during normal use and in “standby” operation, when the end product\nis not in use. In addition to the environmental and economic benefits of reduced energy usage, our energy-saving\ntechnologies provide a number of benefits to our customers; these include helping them meet the increasingly stringent\nefficiency standards now in effect for many electronic products, and enabling the elimination of bulky, costly heatsinks\nused to dissipate the heat produced by wasted electricity. By reducing component count, circuit-board size and the need\nfor heatsinks, our products also contribute to a reduction in materials usage and electronic waste.\nWhile the size of our addressable market fluctuates with changes in macroeconomic and industry conditions, the\nmarket has generally exhibited a modest growth rate over time as growth in the unit volume of power converters has been\noffset to a large degree by reductions in the average selling price of components in this market. Therefore, the growth of\nour business depends largely on increasing our penetration of the markets that we serve and on further expanding our\naddressable market. Our growth strategy includes the following elements:\n• Increase our penetration of the markets we serve. We currently address AC-DC applications with power\noutputs up to approximately 500 watts, gate-driver applications ranging approximately 100 kilowatts up\nto gigawatts, and motor-drive applications up to approximately 400 watts. Through our research and\ndevelopment efforts, we seek to introduce more advanced products for these markets offering higher\nlevels of integration and performance compared to earlier products. We also continue to expand our sales\nand application-engineering staff and our network of distributors, as well as our offerings of technical\ndocumentation and design-support tools and services to help customers use our products. These tools\nand services include our PI Expert™ design software, which we offer free of charge, and our\ntransformer-sample service. In 2022 we launched PowerPros℠, a live online video support service that\n4\nenables power-supply designers to talk directly with members of our applications engineering team 24\nhours a day, six days a week, anywhere in the world.\n• Capitalize on efforts to reduce carbon emissions by providing products that contribute to improved\nenergy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy. In its 2019 World Energy Outlook, the\nInternational Energy Agency estimated that more than two-thirds of the reduction in carbon-dioxide\n(“CO2”) emissions needed to achieve the “Sustainable Development Scenario” of the United Nations\nSustainable Development Agenda is to come from improved energy efficiency and increased use of\nrenewable energy. Energy savings enabled by our products help our customers comply with regulations\nthat seek to curb energy consumption in support of reducing CO2 emissions. For example: our\nEcoSmart™ technology drastically reduces the amount of energy consumed by electronic products when\nthey are plugged in but not in use; our PowiGaN™ gallium-nitride (“GaN”) transistors reduce energy\nconsumption compared to silicon transistors; and our BridgeSwitch™ motor-driver ICs provide highly\nefficient power conversion for BLDC motors in appliances and industrial applications. Also, our gate-\ndriver products are critical components in energy-efficient DC motor drives, solar- and wind-power\nsystems, efficient high-voltage DC transmission systems (including transmission of energy from\nrenewable energy installations to the power grid), and low-emissions transportation applications such as\nelectric locomotives.\n• Increase the size of our addressable market. Prior to 2010 our addressable market consisted of AC-DC\napplications with up to about 50 watts of output, a served available market (“SAM”) opportunity of\napproximately $1.5 billion. Since then we have expanded our SAM to approximately $4 billion through\na variety of means. These include the introduction of products that enable us to address higher-power\nAC-DC applications (such as our Hiper™ product families), the introduction of LED-driver products,\nand our entry into the gate-driver market through the acquisition of CT-Concept Technologie AG in\n2012. In 2016 we introduced the SCALE-iDriverTM family of ICs, broadening the range of gate-driver\napplications we can address, and in 2018 we introduced our BridgeSwitch™ motor-driver ICs for BLDC\nmotors. We have recently introduced a series of automotive-qualified versions of our products, including\nSCALE-iDriver, InnoSwitch™ and LinkSwitch™ ICs, targeting the EV market; we expect to introduce\nadditional products targeting EVs in the future, and expect automotive applications to become a\nsignificant portion of our SAM over time.\nAlso contributing to our SAM expansion has been the emergence of new applications within the power\nranges that our products can address. For example, applications such as “smart” utility meters, battery-\npowered lawn equipment and bicycles, and USB power receptacles (often installed alongside traditional\nAC wall outlets) can incorporate our products. The increased use of connectivity, LED lighting and other\npower-consuming electronic features in consumer appliances has also enhanced our SAM.\nFinally, we have expanded our SAM through the development of new technologies that increase the\nvalue (and therefore the average selling prices) of our products. For example, our InnoSwitch™ ICs\nintegrate circuitry from the secondary, or low-voltage, side of AC-DC power supplies, whereas earlier\nproduct families integrated circuitry only on the primary, or high-voltage side. In 2019 we began\nincorporating our proprietary GaN transistors in some our products, enabling a higher level of energy\nefficiency than ICs with silicon transistors. Since then, we have introduced a variety of new products\nutilizing GaN technology, as well as new generations of our GaN technology capable of supporting\nhigher voltages (as high as 1250 volts). We are currently developing new products incorporating these\ntechnologies, which we believe will enable us to address higher-power applications than we address with\nour current range of products and therefore further expand our SAM.\nWe intend to continue expanding our SAM in the years ahead through all of the means described above.\nIndustry Background\nVirtually every electronic device that plugs into a wall socket requires a power supply to convert the high-voltage\nalternating current provided by electric utilities into the low-voltage direct current required by most electronic devices. A\npower supply may be located inside a device, such as a consumer appliance or flat-panel TV, or it may be outside the\ndevice as in the case of a mobile-phone charger or an adapter for a cordless phone or cable modem.\nUntil approximately 1970, AC-DC power supplies were generally in the form of line-frequency, or linear,\ntransformers. These devices, consisting primarily of copper wire wound around an iron core, tend to be bulky and heavy,\nand typically waste a substantial amount of electricity. In the 1970s, the availability of high-voltage discrete\n5\nsemiconductors enabled the development of a new generation of power supplies known as switched-mode power supplies,\nor switchers. These switchers generally came to be cost-effective alternatives to linear transformers in applications\nrequiring more than a few watts of power; in recent years the use of linear transformers has declined even further as a\nresult of energy-efficiency standards and higher raw-material prices.\nSwitchers are generally smaller, lighter-weight and more energy-efficient than linear transformers. However,\nswitchers designed with discrete components are highly complex, containing numerous components and requiring a high\nlevel of analog design expertise. Further, the complexity and high component count of discrete switchers make them\nrelatively costly, difficult to manufacture and prone to failures. Also, some discrete switchers lack protection and energy-\nefficiency features; adding these features may further increase the component count, cost and complexity of the power\nsupply.\nIn high-power systems such as industrial motor drives, electric locomotives and renewable-energy systems, power\nconversion is typically performed using arrays of high-power silicon transistors known as IGBT modules; these modules\nare operated by electronic circuitry known as gate drivers (or IGBT drivers), whose function is to ensure accurate, safe\nand reliable operation of the IGBT modules. Like discrete power supplies, discrete gate drivers tend to be highly complex,\nrequiring a large number of components and a great deal of design expertise.\nOur Highly Integrated Approach\nIn 1994 we introduced TOPSwitch, the industry’s first cost-effective high-voltage IC for switched-mode AC-DC\npower supplies. We have since introduced a range of other product families, expanding the range of power-supply\napplications we can serve and enhancing our competitiveness in applications we already addressed. In 2012 we expanded\nour addressable market to include high-voltage gate drivers, and in 2018 we introduced our BridgeSwitch motor-driver\nICs for BLDC motors.\nOur products drastically reduce the complexity and component count of power converters compared to typical\ndiscrete designs by integrating many of the functions otherwise performed by numerous discrete electronic components,\nand by eliminating (or reducing the size and cost of) additional components through innovative system design. As a result,\nour products enable power converters to have superior features and functionality at a total cost equal to or lower than that\nof many competing alternatives. Our products offer the following key benefits:\n• Fewer Components, Reduced Size and Higher Reliability\nOur highly integrated ICs and gate drivers enable designs with up to 70% fewer components than comparable\ndiscrete designs. This reduction in component count enhances reliability and efficiency, reduces size, and results in lower\nmanufacturing costs for our customers. Power supplies that incorporate our ICs are also lighter and more portable than\ncomparable power supplies built with linear transformers, which are still used in some low-power applications.\n• Reduced Time-to-Market, Enhanced Manufacturability\nBecause our products eliminate much of the complexity associated with the design of power converters, designs\ncan typically be completed in much less time, resulting in more efficient use of our customers’ design resources and shorter\ntime-to-market for new designs. The lower component count and reduced complexity enabled by our products also makes\ndesigns more suitable for high-volume manufacturing. We also provide extensive hands-on design support as well as\nonline design tools, such as our PI Expert design software, that further reduce time-to-market and product development\nrisks.\n• Energy Efficiency\nOur EcoSmart technology improves the energy efficiency of electronic devices during normal operation as well\nas standby and “no-load” conditions. This technology enables manufacturers to cost-effectively meet the growing demand\nfor energy-efficient products, and to comply with increasingly stringent energy-efficiency requirements. Our proprietary\nGaN transistor technology, introduced in 2019, offers substantially higher levels of active-mode efficiency compared to\ntraditional silicon switches, while our BridgeSwitch motor-driver ICs enable efficiency of up to 98.5%, not only\nminimizing waste but also eliminating the need for heatsinks in many applications, which in turn reduces cost and weight.\n• Wide Power Range and Scalability\nProducts in our current IC families can address AC-DC power supplies with output power up to approximately\n500 watts as well as some high-voltage DC-DC applications; our high-voltage gate drivers are used in applications with\npower levels ranging from approximately 100 kilowatts to gigawatts, while our motor-driver ICs address BLDC\n6\napplications up to about 400 watts. Within each of our product families, designers can scale up or down in power to address\na wide range of designs with minimal design effort.\nEnergy Efficiency\nPower supplies often draw significantly more electricity than the amount needed by the devices they power. As\na result, billions of dollars’ worth of electricity is wasted each year, and millions of tons of greenhouse gases are\nunnecessarily produced by power plants. Energy waste occurs during the normal operation of a device and in standby\nmode, when the device is plugged in but idle. For example: computers and printers waste energy while in “sleep” mode;\nTVs that are turned off by remote control consume energy while awaiting a remote-control signal to turn them back on; a\nmobile-phone charger left plugged into a wall outlet continues to draw electricity even when not connected to the phone\n(a condition known as “no-load”); and many common household appliances, such as microwave ovens, dishwashers and\nwashing machines, also consume power when not in use. In fact, a 2015 study by the National Resources Defense Council\nfound that devices that are “always-on” but inactive may be causing as much as $19 billion in annual energy waste in the\nUnited States alone.\nIn response to concerns about the environmental impact of carbon emissions, policymakers have taken action to\npromote energy efficiency. For example, the ENERGY STAR® program and the European Union Code of Conduct\nencourage manufacturers of electronic devices to comply with voluntary energy-efficiency specifications. In 2007 the\nCalifornia Energy Commission (“CEC”) implemented mandatory efficiency standards for external power supplies. The\nCEC standards were implemented nationwide in the United States in July 2008 as a result of the Energy Independence and\nSecurity Act of 2007 (“EISA”); these federal standards were tightened in 2016. Similar standards for external power\nsupplies took effect in the European Union in 2010 as part of the EU’s EcoDesign Directive for Energy-Related Products.\nIn 2010, the EU EcoDesign Directive implemented standards limiting standby power consumption on a wide\nrange of electronic products. The limit was reduced by 50 percent beginning in 2013, with many products now limited to\n500 milliwatts of standby usage; the EU standards are scheduled to tighten further beginning in 2025. The EISA legislation\nalso required substantial improvements in the efficiency of lighting technologies, effectively resulting in the phase-out of\nmost incandescent light sources and increased adoption of LED-lighting technology. In December 2019 the government\nof China published new efficiency standards for room air conditioners, which took effect in July 2020. In 2022 India’s\nBureau of Energy Efficiency implemented new labeling standards for ceiling fans in an effort to drive adoption of BLDC\nmotors in place of less efficient induction motors.\nWe believe we offer products that enable manufacturers to meet or exceed these regulations, and all other such\nregulations of which we are aware. Since 1998, our AC-DC power-conversion ICs have featured our EcoSmart technology\nwhich drastically reduces standby power waste. We have sold more than 20 billion ICs featuring EcoSmart technology,\nresulting in estimated savings of more than 175 terawatt-hours of standby power worldwide. In 2010 we expanded our\nportfolio of energy-saving products with the introduction of our CapZero and SenZero IC families, which eliminate\nadditional sources of standby waste in some power supplies. We also offer a range of products designed specifically for\nLED-lighting applications. Our GaN technology, introduced in 2019, also dramatically improves the active-mode\nefficiency of power-supplies.\nProducts\nBelow is a brief description of our products:\n• AC-DC power conversion products\nTOPSwitch, our first commercially successful product family, was introduced in 1994. Since then we have\nintroduced a wide range of products (such as our TinySwitch, LinkSwitch and Hiper families) to increase the level of\nintegration and improve upon the functionality of the original TOPSwitch, and to broaden the range of power levels we\ncan address. In 2010 we introduced our CapZero and SenZero families, which reduce standby power consumption in\ncertain applications by eliminating waste caused by so-called bleed resistors and sense resistors. We have also introduced\nproducts designed specifically for LED-lighting applications, known as LYTSwitch ICs, as well as a range of high-\nperformance, high-voltage diodes known as Qspeed diodes.\nIn 2014 we introduced our InnoSwitch product family, the first power-supply ICs to combine primary, secondary\nand feedback circuits into a single package. These ICs employ a proprietary technology known as FluxLink to enable\nprecise control without the need for optical components, which tend to add cost and diminish the reliability of power\nsupplies. In 2019 we began offering InnoSwitch ICs with more-efficient GaN transistors rather than silicon transistors. In\n2020 we introduced GaN-based MinE-CAP ICs, which enable the use of smaller input capacitors as a way to further reduce\nthe size of a power supply. Our ClampZero ICs, introduced in 2021 alongside the GaN-based InnoSwitch4-CZ family of\n7\nICs, further enhance efficiency by recovering power losses associated with the high switching frequency of GaN\ntransistors. In 2023 we announced new versions of our InnoSwitch products incorporating GaN transistors with higher\nvoltage ratings of 900 volts and 1250 volts; earlier GaN products feature transistors rated at 750 volts.\nThis portfolio of power-conversion products generally addresses power supplies ranging from less than one watt\nof output up to approximately 500 watts of output, a market we refer to as the “low-power” market. This market consists\nof an extremely broad range of applications including mobile-device chargers, consumer appliances, utility meters, LCD\nmonitors, main and standby power supplies for desktop computers, servers and TVs, and numerous other consumer and\nindustrial applications, as well as LED lighting. We also now offer automotive-qualified versions of certain products, such\nas InnoSwitch ICs, for use in electric vehicles.\n• High-voltage gate drivers\nWe offer a range of high-voltage gate-driver products sold primarily under the SCALE and SCALE-2 product-\nfamily names. These products are fully assembled circuit boards incorporating multiple ICs, electrical isolation\ncomponents and other circuitry. We offer both ready-to-operate “plug-and-play” drivers designed specifically for use with\nparticular IGBT modules, as well as “driver cores,” which provide more basic driver functionality that customers can\ncustomize to their own specifications after purchase. In 2016 we introduced the SCALE-iDriver family of standalone ICs,\nwhich enables us to address applications ranging from a few kilowatts up to about 100 kilowatts, whereas previously our\nsales of high-power products were primarily for applications above 100 kilowatts. In 2020 we introduced an automotive-\nqualified version of SCALE-iDriver suitable for use in powertrain and charging applications for electric vehicles.\n• Motor-driver products\nThe BridgeSwitch family of products, introduced in 2018, is a family of motor-driver ICs addressing BLDC\nmotor applications up to approximately 400 watts. Such applications include refrigerator compressors, ceiling fans, air\npurifiers as well as pumps, fans and blowers used in consumer appliances such as dishwashers and laundry machines.\nBridgeSwitch products are complemented by our Motor-Expert software, which provides configuration and diagnostic\ntools for design engineers.\nOther Product Information\nTOPSwitch, TinySwitch, LinkSwitch, DPA-Switch, EcoSmart, Hiper, Qspeed, InnoSwitch, BridgeSwitch,\nSCALE, SCALE-II, SCALE-III, SCALE-iDriver, PeakSwitch, CAPZero, SENZero, ChiPhy, FluxLink, CONCEPT, PI\nExpert and Motor-Expert are trademarks of Power Integrations, Inc.\nEnd Markets and Applications\nOur net revenues consist primarily of sales of the products described above. When evaluating our net revenues,\nwe categorize our sales into the following four major end-market groupings: communications, computer, consumer, and\nindustrial.\nThe table below provides the approximate mix of our net sales by end market:\nYear Ended Decem ber 31,\nEnd Market 2023 2022 2021\nCommunications ................................... 29% 21 % 30%\nComputer ......................................... 12% 10 % 10%\nConsumer ........................................ 27% 33 % 32%\nIndustrial ......................................... 32% 36 % 28%\n8\nOur products are used in a vast range of power-conversion applications in the above-listed end-market categories.\nThe following chart lists the most prominent applications for our products in each category.\nMarket Category Primary Applications\nCommunications ...... Mobile-phone chargers, adapters for routers, cordless phones, broadband modems,\nvoice-over-IP phones, other network and telecom gear\nComputer ............ Desktop PCs and monitors, servers, adapters for tablets and notebook computers, other\ncomputer peripherals\nConsumer ...........

We have sales\noffices in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, India, China, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Canada,\nSingapore and Taiwan. Direct sales to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers represented approximately 31%,\n30% and 25% of our net product revenues in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, while sales to distributors accounted for\nthe remainder in each of the corresponding years. Most of our distributors are entitled to return privileges based on\nrevenues and are protected from price reductions affecting their inventories. Our distributors are not subject to minimum\npurchase requirements, and sales representatives and distributors can discontinue marketing our products at any time.\nOur sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our\ncustomers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements\nand in manufacturing availability. Historically, our business has been characterized by short-lead-time orders and quick\ndelivery schedules.\nOur top ten customers, including distributors that resell to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers,\naccounted for approximately 80%, 76% and 78% of net revenues in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2023, three\ncustomers each accounted for more than 10% of revenues, in 2022 and 2021, two customers, both distributors, each\naccounted for more than 10% of revenues.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development efforts are focused on improving our technologies, introducing new products to\nexpand our addressable markets, reducing the costs of existing products, and improving the cost-effectiveness and\nfunctionality of our customers’ power converters. We have assembled teams of highly skilled engineers to meet our\nresearch and development goals. These engineers have expertise in high-voltage device structure and process technology,\nanalog and digital IC design, system architecture and packaging.\nIntellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights\nWe use a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and confidentiality procedures to protect\nour intellectual-property rights. In 2023, we received 17 U.S. and 48 foreign patents. As of December 31, 2023, we held\n300 U.S. and 349 foreign patents. Both U.S. and foreign patents have expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2044. While\nour patent portfolio as a whole is important to the success of our business, we are not materially dependent upon any single\npatent. We also hold trademarks in the U.S. and various other geographies including Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong, China,\nUnited Kingdom, Europe, Japan, India, Brazil, Russia and Switzerland.\nWe regard as proprietary some equipment, processes, information and knowledge that we have developed and\nused in the design and manufacture of our products. Our trade secrets include a high-volume production process used in\nthe manufacture of our high-voltage ICs. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through\nnon-disclosure agreements, proprietary-information agreements with employees and consultants, and other security\nmeasures.\n9\nManufacturing\nWe contract with three foundries for the manufacture of the vast majority of our silicon wafers: (1) Lapis\nSemiconductor Co., Ltd., or Lapis, (formerly OKI Electric Industry), (2) Seiko Epson Corporation, or Epson and (3) X-\nFAB Semiconductor Foundries AG, or X-FAB. These contractors manufacture wafers using our proprietary high-voltage\nprocess technologies at fabrication facilities located in Japan, Germany and the United States.\nOur ICs are assembled, packaged and tested by independent subcontractors in China, Malaysia, Thailand and the\nPhilippines; a small percentage of our ICs are tested at our headquarters facility in California. Our gate-driver boards are\nassembled and tested by independent subcontractors in Sri Lanka and Thailand; some of the boards are tested at our facility\nin Switzerland.\nOur fabless manufacturing model enables us to focus on our engineering and design strengths, minimize capital\nexpenditures and still have access to high-volume manufacturing capacity. We utilize both proprietary and standard IC\npackages for assembly. Some of the materials used in our packages and certain aspects of the assembly process are specific\nto our products. We require our assembly manufacturers to use high-voltage molding compounds which are more difficult\nto process than industry standard molding compounds. We work closely with our contractors on a continuous basis to\nmaintain and improve our manufacturing processes.\nOur proprietary high-voltage processes do not require leading-edge geometries, which enables us to use our\nfoundries’ older, lower-cost facilities for wafer manufacturing. However, because of our highly sensitive high-voltage\nprocess, we must interact closely with our foundries to achieve satisfactory yields. Our wafer supply agreements with\nLapis, Epson and X-FAB expire in April 2028, December 2025 and December 2028, respectively. Under the terms of the\nLapis and Epson agreements, each supplier has agreed to reserve a specified amount of production capacity and to sell\nwafers to us at fixed prices, which are subject to periodic review jointly by the supplier and us. In addition, Lapis and\nEpson require us to supply them with a rolling six-month forecast on a monthly basis. Our agreements with Lapis and\nEpson each provide for the purchase of wafers in U.S. dollars, with mutual sharing of the impact of the fluctuations in the\nexchange rate between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar. Under the terms of the X-FAB agreement, X-FAB has agreed\nto reserve a specified amount of production capacity and to sell wafers to us at fixed prices, which are subject to periodic\nreview jointly by X-FAB and us. The agreement with X-FAB also requires us to supply them with rolling six-month\nforecasts on a monthly basis. Our purchases of wafers from X-FAB are denominated in U.S. dollars.\nAlthough some aspects of our relationships with Lapis, Epson and X-FAB are contractual, some important aspects\nof these relationships are not written in binding contracts and depend on the suppliers’ continued cooperation. We cannot\nassure that we will continue to work successfully with Lapis, Epson or X-FAB in the future, that they will continue to\nprovide us with sufficient capacity at their foundries to meet our needs, or that any of them will not seek an early\ntermination of their wafer supply agreement with us. Our operating results could suffer in the event of a supply disruption\nwith one or more of our foundries if we were unable to quickly qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or\nnew products or if these sources were unable to produce wafers with acceptable manufacturing yields.\nWe typically receive shipments from our foundries approximately four to six weeks after placing orders, and lead\ntimes for new products can be substantially longer. To provide sufficient time for assembly, testing and finishing, we\ntypically need to receive wafers four weeks before the desired ship date to our customers. As a result of these factors and\nthe fact that customers’ orders can be placed with little advance notice, we have only a limited ability to react to fluctuations\nin demand for our products. We try to carry a substantial amount of wafer and finished-goods inventory to help offset\nthese risks and to better serve our markets and meet customer demand.\nCompetition\nCompeting alternatives to our high-voltage ICs for the power-supply market include monolithic and hybrid ICs\nfrom companies such as STMicroelectronics, Infineon Technologies and Sanken Electric Company, as well as PWM-\ncontroller chips paired with discrete high-voltage silicon or GaN transistors. Such controller chips are produced by a large\nnumber of vendors, including those listed above as well as others including NXP Semiconductors, Diodes Inc., On-Bright\nElectronics, MediaTek Inc., Renesas Electronics and, in recent years, an increasing number of Chinese suppliers such as\nSouthchip Semiconductor, Chipown Microelectronics and Hangzhou Silan Microelectronics Co. Our gate-driver products\ncompete with alternatives from such companies as Broadcom, Infineon, Mitsubishi Electric, Fuji Electric, Semikron and\nHangzhou Firstack Technology Co., as well as driver circuits made up of discrete devices. Our motor-driver ICs compete\nwith power modules from such companies as ON Semiconductor, Infineon, STMicroelectronics, Mitsubishi and Sanken\nas well as discrete designs from a wide range of other suppliers. In general, we expect competition from Chinese\nsemiconductor vendors to intensify over time reflecting China’s stated aim to develop its domestic semiconductor industry.\n10\nGenerally, our products enable customers to design power converters with total bill-of-materials costs similar to\nthose of competing alternatives. As a result, the value of our products is influenced by the prices of discrete components,\nwhich fluctuate in relation to market demand, raw-material prices and other factors, but have generally decreased over\ntime.\nWhile we vary the pricing of our ICs in response to fluctuations in prices of alternative solutions, we also compete\nbased on a variety of other factors. Most importantly, the highly integrated nature of our products enables designs that\nutilize fewer total components than comparable discrete designs or designs using other integrated or hybrid products. This\nenables power converters to be designed more quickly and manufactured more efficiently and reliably than competing\ndesigns. We also compete on the basis of product functionality such as safety features and energy-efficiency features and\non the basis of the technical support we provide to our customers. This support includes hands-on design assistance as\nwell as a range of design tools and documentation such as software and reference designs. We also believe that our record\nof product quality and history of delivering products to our customers on a timely basis serve as additional competitive\nadvantages.\nWarranty\nWe generally warrant that our products will substantially conform to the published specifications for 12 months\nfrom the date of shipment. Under the terms and conditions of sale, our liability is limited generally to either a credit equal\nto the purchase price or replacement of the defective part.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations worldwide, including,\nbut not limited to, laws, rules and regulations related to anti-corruption, antitrust, data privacy requirements, employment,\nenvironmental, foreign exchange controls, health and safety requirements, immigration, import/export requirements, IP\nand tax. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines,\nsuspension of certain of our business activities, limitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate in\nthe case of environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Changes in environmental\nlaws and regulations could require us to alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials. Our failure to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations could subject us to future liabilities.\nSee also our risk factors under Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Risks\nRelated to Laws and Regulations.”\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 819 full-time personnel across 14 countries with 361, or 44% of the\ntotal, residing in North America, while 56% resided offshore comprising 334 in the Asia-Pacific region and 124 across\nEurope.

Risk Factors.\nThe following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those\ncontained in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. The risks and uncertainties described below\nare not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial\nalso may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or such other risks actually occurs, our business\ncould be harmed.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur operating results are volatile and difficult to predict. If we fail to meet the expectations of public market\nanalysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly. Our net revenues and operating\nresults have varied significantly in the past, are difficult to forecast, are subject to numerous factors both within and outside\nof our control, and may fluctuate significantly in the future. As a result, our operating results could fall below the\nexpectations of public market analysts or investors. If that occurs, the price of our stock may decline.\nSome of the factors that could affect our operating results include the following:\n• the demand for our products declining in the major end markets we serve, which may occur due to\ncompetitive factors, supply-chain fluctuations, rising inflation or other changes in macroeconomic\nconditions;\n• reliance on international sales activities for a substantial portion of our net revenues;\n• the volume and timing of orders received from customers;\n• our products are sold through distributors, which limits our direct interaction with our end customers,\nwhich reduces our ability to forecast sales and increases the complexity of our business;\n• the ability of our products to penetrate additional markets;\n• our ability to develop and bring to market new products and technologies on a timely basis;\n• failure, disruption, security breaches, or other incidents impacting our information technology\ninfrastructure or information management systems;\n• interruptions in our information technology systems;\n• competitive pressures on selling prices;\n• we face risks related to the Novel Coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”), which has disrupted and may\nagain disrupt our operations, including our manufacturing, research and development, and sales and\nmarketing activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,\noperating results and cash flows;\n• risks associated with our supply chain including, the volume, cost and timing of delivery of orders placed\nby us with our wafer foundries and assembly subcontractors, and their ability to procure materials;\n• our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n• the lengthy timing of our sales cycle;\n• earthquakes, fire, pandemics or other disasters;\n• undetected defects and failures in meeting the exact specifications required by our products;\n• fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese\nyen, the Euro and the Swiss franc;\n• the inability to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights;\n• expenses we are required to incur (or choose to incur) in connection with our intellectual property\nlitigations;\n• changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or\nunfavorable assessments from tax audits may increase the amount of taxes we are required to pay;\n14\n• changes in environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to energy consumption and\nclimate change;\n• uncertainties arising out of economic consequences of current and potential military actions, including\ncurrent on-going conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, or terrorist activities and associated political\ninstability;\n• risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments;\n• our ability to successfully integrate, or realize the expected benefits from, our acquisitions; and\n• continued impact of changes in securities laws and regulations, including potential risks resulting from\nour evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nRisks Related to the Operation and Growth of Our Business\nIf demand for our products continues to decline in our major end markets, our net revenues will continue to\ndecline further. When our customers are not successful in maintaining high levels of demand for their products, their\ndemand for our ICs decreases, which adversely affects our operating results. A limited number of applications of our\nproducts, such as cellphone chargers and consumer appliances, make up a significant percentage of our net revenues. We\nexpect that a significant level of our net revenues and operating results will continue to be dependent upon these\napplications in the near term. Demand for end products incorporating our products has been highly cyclical over time and\nhas been impacted by economic downturns; our recent results have been impacted by economic conditions including\ninflation and the effects of anti-COVID measures in China. Any further economic slowdown in the end markets that we\nserve could cause a further slowdown in demand for our ICs, causing our net revenues to decline further and potentially\nresult in write-offs of excess or obsolete inventory, which could cause the price of our stock to fall.\nOur international sales activities account for a substantial portion of our net revenues, which subjects us to\nsubstantial risks. Sales to customers outside of the United States of America account for, and have accounted for a large\nportion of our net revenues, including approximately 98%, 96% and 98% of our net revenues for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If our international sales declined and we were unable to increase\ndomestic sales, our revenues would decline and our operating results would be harmed. International sales involve a\nnumber of risks to us, including:\n• tariffs, protectionist measures and other trade barriers and restrictions;\n• potential insolvency of international distributors and representatives;\n• reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n• the impact of recessionary environments and inflation in the United States and other economies where\nwe do business;\n• global, regional, and local economic and political conditions, including, but not limited to, social,\neconomic, political, and supply chain instability related to the uncertainty regarding relationships among\nthe international community as a whole including potential risks stemming from tensions between China\nand Taiwan and between China and Western countries, as well as related to armed conflicts that exist,\nor in the future could exist, in various parts of the world;\n• the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign and applicable U.S. Federal and state laws; and\n• foreign-currency exchange risk.\nOur failure to adequately address these risks could reduce our international sales and materially and adversely\naffect our operating results. Furthermore, because substantially all of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars,\nincreases in the value of the dollar cause the price of our products in foreign markets to rise, making our products more\nexpensive relative to competing products priced in local currencies.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with any of our customers and if they fail to place, or if they cancel or\nreschedule orders for our products, our operating results and our business may suffer. Our business is characterized by\nshort-term customer orders and shipment schedules, and the ordering patterns of some of our large customers have been\nunpredictable in the past and will likely remain unpredictable in the future. Not only does the volume of units ordered by\nparticular customers vary substantially from period to period, but also purchase orders received from particular customers\noften vary substantially from early oral estimates provided by those customers for planning purposes. In addition, customer\n15\norders can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer. In the past, we have experienced\ncustomer cancellations of substantial orders for reasons beyond our control, and significant cancellations could occur again\nat any time. Also, a relatively small number of distributors, OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers account for\na significant portion of our revenues. Specifically, our top ten customers, including distributors, accounted for 80%, 76%\nand 78% of our net revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. However, a\nsignificant portion of these revenues are attributable to sales of our products through distributors of electronic components.\nThese distributors sell our products to a broad, diverse range of end users, including OEMs and merchant power supply\nmanufacturers, which mitigates the risk of customer concentration to a large degree.\nOur products are sold through distributors, which limits our direct interaction with our end customers, therefore\nreducing our ability to forecast sales and increasing the complexity of our business. Sales to distributors accounted for\napproximately 69%, 70% and 75% of net revenues in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSelling through distributors reduces our ability to forecast sales and increases the complexity of our business, requiring us\nto:\n• manage a more complex supply chain;\n• monitor the level of inventory of our products at each distributor, and\n• monitor the financial condition and credit-worthiness of our distributors, many of which are located\noutside of the United States and are not publicly traded.\nSince we have limited ability to forecast inventory levels at our end customers, it is possible that there may be\nsignificant build-up of inventories in the distributor channel, with the OEM or the OEM’s contract manufacturer. Such a\nbuildup could result in a slowdown in orders, requests for returns from customers, or requests to move out planned\nshipments. This could adversely impact our revenues and profits. Any failure to manage these complexities could disrupt\nor reduce sales of our products and unfavorably impact our financial results.\nIf our products do not penetrate additional markets, our business will not grow as we expect. We believe that our\nfuture success depends in part upon our ability to penetrate additional markets for our products. We cannot assure that we\nwill be able to overcome the marketing or technological challenges necessary to penetrate additional markets. To the extent\nthat a competitor penetrates additional markets before we do, or takes market share from us in our existing markets, our\nnet revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our efforts to enhance existing products and introduce new products are not successful, we may not be able to\ngenerate demand for our products. Our success depends in significant part upon our ability to develop new ICs for high-\nvoltage power conversion for existing and new markets, to introduce these products in a timely manner and to have these\nproducts selected for design into products of leading manufacturers. New product introduction schedules are subject to the\nrisks and uncertainties that typically accompany development and delivery of complex technologies to the market place,\nincluding product development delays and defects. If we fail to develop and sell new products in a timely manner, then\nour net revenues could decline.\nIn addition, we cannot be sure that we will be able to adjust to changing market demands as quickly and cost-\neffectively as necessary to compete successfully. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we will be able to introduce new\nproducts in a timely and cost-effective manner or in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or that these products\nwill achieve market acceptance. Our failure, or our customers’ failure, to develop and introduce new products successfully\nand in a timely manner would harm our business. In addition, customers may defer or return orders for existing products\nin response to the introduction of new products. When a potential liability exists we will maintain reserves for customer\nreturns, however we cannot assure that these reserves will be adequate.\nAny failure, disruption or security breach or incident otherwise impacting our information technology\ninfrastructure or information management systems could have an adverse impact on our business and operations. Cyber-\nattacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent. As the frequency\nof cyber-attacks and resulting breaches reported by other businesses and governments increases, we expect to continue to\ndevote significant resources to improve and maintain our IT infrastructure. We have incurred and may in the future incur\nsignificant costs in order to implement, maintain and/or update security systems we believe are necessary to protect our\nIT infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are\noften not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement\nadequate preventive measures. A breakdown in existing controls and procedures around our cyber-security environment\nmay prevent us from detecting, reporting or responding to cyber incidents in a timely manner and could have a material\n16\nadverse effect on our financial position and value of our stock. We cannot guarantee that our implemented processes for\nIT and risk mitigation measures will be effective for IT systems under our control.\nFurthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical\nbusiness systems. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply\nchains have not been or will not be compromised or that they do not or will not in the future contain exploitable defects or\nbugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our IT infrastructure, including our products and services, or the third-\nparty information technology systems that support our services.\nWe have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party service providers. Our ability to\nmonitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security\nmeasures in place. If one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited or more difficult\nbecause we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach.\nInterruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We rely on the efficient\nand uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any\nsignificant system or network disruption, including but not limited to new system implementations, computer viruses,\nsecurity breaches, or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations, sales and operating results.\nWe have implemented measures to manage our risks related to such disruptions, but such disruptions could still occur and\nnegatively impact our operations and financial results. Furthermore, the risk of state-supported and geopolitically\nmotivated cybersecurity incidents may increase due to geopolitical instability. In addition, we may incur additional costs\nto remedy any damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.\nIntense competition in the high-voltage power supply industry may lead to a decrease in our average selling price\nand reduced sales volume of our products. The high-voltage power supply industry is intensely competitive and\ncharacterized by significant price sensitivity. Our products face competition from alternative technologies, such as linear\ntransformers, discrete switcher power supplies, and other integrated and hybrid solutions. If the price of competing\nsolutions decreases significantly, the cost effectiveness of our products will be adversely affected. If power requirements\nfor applications in which our products are currently utilized go outside the cost-effective range of our products, some of\nthese alternative technologies can be used more cost effectively. In addition, as our patents expire, our competitors could\nlegally begin using the technology covered by the expired patents in their products, potentially increasing the performance\nof their products and/or decreasing the cost of their products, which may enable our competitors to compete more\neffectively. Our current patents may or may not inhibit our competitors from getting any benefit from an expired patent.\nOur U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2044. We cannot assure that our products will continue to\ncompete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements\nintroduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market. We believe our failure to compete successfully\nin the high-voltage power supply business, including our ability to introduce new products with higher average selling\nprices, would materially harm our operating results.\nWe face risks related to global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which have disrupted and may\nagain disrupt our operations, including our manufacturing, research and development, and sales and marketing activities,\nwhich could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our\nbusiness as well as the business of our suppliers, customers and distributors was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\nand may in the future be adversely impacted by the world-wide response to any further global health crises. Such impacts\ninclude public health measures, travel restrictions, business shutdowns, border closures, delivery and freight delays and\nother disruptions. These disruptions may adversely affect not only our sales and marketing activities, product development,\nmanufacturing and product shipments which could negatively impact our ability to meet customer commitments but also\nour customers’ ability to manufacture their products, which could reduce their demand for our products. The COVID-19\npandemic caused a significant economic downturn in local and global economies and in financial markets. Any future\nglobal health crisis could have similar economic consequences which may result in reduced demand for our products and\nhave a material adverse effect on our revenues, customer relationships, operating results, cash flows, financial condition\nand stock price.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products and if they fail to provide us\nsufficient quantities of wafers, our business may suffer. Our primary supply arrangements for the production of wafers are\nwith Epson, Lapis and X-FAB. Our contracts with these suppliers expire on varying dates, with the earliest to expire in\nDecember 2025. Although some aspects of our relationships with Lapis, X-FAB and Epson are contractual, many\nimportant aspects of these relationships depend on their continued cooperation. We cannot assure that we will continue to\nwork successfully with Epson, Lapis and X-FAB in the future, and that the wafer foundries’ capacity will meet our needs.\n17\nAdditionally, one or more of these wafer foundries could seek an early termination of our wafer supply agreements. Any\nserious disruption in the supply of wafers from Epson, Lapis and X-FAB could harm our business. We estimate that it\nwould take 12 to 24 months from the time we identified an alternate manufacturing source to produce wafers with\nacceptable manufacturing yields in sufficient quantities to meet our needs.\nAlthough we provide our foundries with rolling forecasts of our production requirements, their ability to provide\nwafers to us is ultimately limited by the available capacity of the wafer foundry. Any reduction in wafer foundry capacity\navailable to us could require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or\nrequire us to make other concessions to meet our customers’ requirements, or may limit our ability to meet demand for\nour products. Further, to the extent demand for our products exceeds wafer foundry capacity, this could inhibit us from\nexpanding our business and harm relationships with our customers. Any of these concessions or limitations could harm\nour business.\nIf our third-party suppliers and independent subcontractors do not produce our wafers and assemble our finished\nproducts at acceptable yields, our net revenues may decline. We depend on independent foundries to produce wafers, and\nindependent subcontractors to assemble and test finished products, at acceptable yields and to deliver them to us in a timely\nmanner. The failure of the foundries to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from selling our products to\nour customers and would likely cause a decline in our net revenues and gross margin. In addition, our IC assembly process\nrequires our manufacturers to use a high-voltage molding compound that has been available from only a few suppliers.\nThese compounds and their specified processing conditions require a more exacting level of process control than normally\nrequired for standard IC packages. Unavailability of assembly materials or problems with the assembly process can\nmaterially and adversely affect yields, timely delivery and cost to manufacture. We may not be able to maintain acceptable\nyields in the future.\nIn addition, if prices for commodities used in our products increase significantly, raw material costs would\nincrease for our suppliers which could result in an increase in the prices our suppliers charge us. To the extent we are not\nable to pass these costs on to our customers; this would have an adverse effect on our gross margins.\nWe must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel is intense\nin our market. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other\nkey management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel,\nsuch as experienced analog design engineers and systems applications engineers. The competition for these employees is\nintense, particularly in Silicon Valley. The loss of the services of one or more of our engineers, executive officers or other\nkey personnel could harm our business. In addition, if one or more of these individuals leaves our employ, and we are\nunable to quickly and efficiently replace those individuals with qualified personnel who can smoothly transition into their\nnew roles, our business may suffer. We do not have long-term employment contracts with, and we do not have in place\nkey person life insurance policies on, any of our employees.\nBecause the sales cycle for our products can be lengthy, we may incur substantial expenses before we generate\nsignificant revenues, if any. Our products are generally incorporated into a customer’s products at the design stage.\nHowever, customer decisions to use our products, commonly referred to as design wins, can often require us to expend\nsignificant research and development and sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success. These\nsignificant research and development and sales and marketing resources often precede volume sales, if any, by a year or\nmore. The value of any design win will largely depend upon the commercial success of the customer’s product. We cannot\nassure that we will continue to achieve design wins or that any design win will result in future revenues. If a customer\ndecides at the design stage not to incorporate our products into its product, we may not have another opportunity for a\ndesign win with respect to that product for many months or years.\nIn the event of an earthquake, fire, other pandemics, natural or other disasters, including with respect to climate\nchange, our operations may be interrupted and our business would be harmed. Our principal executive offices and\noperating facilities are situated near San Francisco, California, and most of our major suppliers, which are wafer foundries\nand assembly houses, are located in areas that have been subject to severe earthquakes, such as Japan. Many of our\nsuppliers are also susceptible to other disasters such as tropical storms, typhoons, tsunamis or other catastrophic events,\nincluding those caused by climate change. In the event of a disaster, we or one or more of our major suppliers may be\ntemporarily unable to continue operations and may suffer significant property damage. Any interruption in our ability, or\nthat of our major suppliers, to continue operations could delay the development and shipment of our products and have a\nsubstantial negative impact on our financial results.\n18\nOur products must meet exacting specifications, and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause\ncustomers to return or stop buying our products and/or impose significant costs to us. Our customers generally establish\ndemanding specifications for quality, performance and reliability, and our products must meet these specifications. ICs as\ncomplex as those we sell often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first\nintroduced or after commencement of commercial shipments. We have from time to time in the past experienced product\nquality, performance or reliability problems. If defects and failures occur in our products, we could experience lost revenue,\nincreased costs, including product warranty or liability claims and costs associated with customer support and product\nrecalls, delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts. While we\nspecifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, certain of our contracts may not exclude\nsuch liabilities. Our liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects may not cover all\nclaims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims. Costs or payments in connection with such claims\ncould harm our operating results.\nRisks Related to Financial Performance\nFluctuations in exchange rates, particularly the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen,\nSwiss franc and euro, may impact our gross margin and net income. Our exchange rate risk related to the Japanese yen\nincludes two of our major suppliers, Epson and Lapis, with which we have wafer supply agreements based in U.S. dollars;\nhowever, these agreements also allow for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between Japanese\nyen and the U.S. dollar. Each year, our management and these suppliers review and negotiate pricing; the negotiated\npricing is denominated in U.S. dollars but is subject to contractual exchange rate provisions. The fluctuation in the\nexchange rate is shared equally between Power Integrations and each of these suppliers. We maintain cash denominated\nin Swiss francs and euros to fund the operations of our Swiss subsidiary. The functional currency of our Swiss subsidiary\nis the U.S. dollar; gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of non-functional currency balances are recorded in\nother income in our consolidated statements of income, and material unfavorable exchange-rate fluctuations with the Swiss\nfranc could negatively impact our net income.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we could lose market share,\nincur costly litigation expenses, suffer incremental price erosion or lose valuable assets, any of which could harm our\noperations and negatively impact our profitability. Our success depends upon our ability to continue our technological\ninnovation and protect our intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and know-how. We are\ncurrently engaged in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, and associated expenses have been, and are\nexpected to remain, material and have adversely affected our operating results. We cannot assure that the steps we have\ntaken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation, or that others will not develop\ncompetitive technologies or products. From time to time, we have received, and we may receive in the future,\ncommunications alleging possible infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Costly litigation\nmay be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement. The failure to\nobtain necessary licenses and other rights, and/or litigation arising out of infringement claims could cause us to lose market\nshare and harm our business.\nAs our patents expire, we will lose intellectual property protection previously afforded by those patents.\nAdditionally, the laws of some foreign countries in which our technology is or may in the future be licensed may not\nprotect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, thus limiting the protections\napplicable to our technology.\nIf we do not prevail in our litigation, we will have expended significant financial resources, potentially without\nany benefit, and may also suffer the loss of rights to use some technologies. We are currently involved in a number of\npatent litigation matters and the outcome of the litigation is uncertain. See Note 13, Legal Proceedings and Contingencies,\nin our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For example, we are\nbeing sued in an ongoing case for patent infringement. Should we ultimately be determined to be infringing another party’s\npatents, or if an injunction is issued against us while litigation is pending on those claims, such result could have an adverse\nimpact on our ability to sell products found to be infringing, either directly or indirectly. In the event of an adverse outcome,\nwe may be required to pay substantial damages, stop our manufacture, use, sale, or importation of infringing products, or\nobtain licenses to the intellectual property we are found to have infringed. We have also incurred, and expect to continue\nto incur, significant legal costs in conducting these lawsuits, including the appeal of the case we won, and our involvement\nin this litigation and any future intellectual property litigation could adversely affect sales and divert the efforts and\nattention of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. Thus, even if\n19\nwe are successful in these lawsuits, the benefits of this success may fail to outweigh the significant legal costs we will\nhave incurred.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable\nassessments from tax audits may increase the amount of taxes we are required to pay. Our operations are subject to income\nand transaction taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions and to review or audit by the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service (“IRS”) and state, local and foreign tax authorities. In addition, the United States, countries in Asia and\nother countries where we do business have recently enacted or are considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and\nother laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational companies. These\npotential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.\nThe European Union (“EU”) member states formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which was\nestablished by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and which generally provides for a 15 per\ncent minimum effective tax rate for multinational corporations, in all jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not\nanticipate that this will have a material impact on our tax provision or effective tax rate, we will continue to monitor the\nevolving tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we are currently subject to an ongoing audit with the California Franchise Tax Board\nfor the tax years 2018 and 2019. The foregoing items could have a material effect on our business, cash flow, results of\noperations or financial conditions.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to energy consumption and climate\nchange, may have a negative impact on our business. Changing environmental regulations and the timetable to implement\nthem continue to impact our customers’ demand for our products. Currently we have limited visibility into our customers’\nstrategies to implement these changing environmental regulations into their business. The inability to accurately determine\nour customers’ strategies could increase our inventory costs related to obsolescence.\nThe semiconductor industry is subject to environmental regulations, particularly those that control and restrict\nthe sourcing, use, transportation, storage, and disposal of certain mineral, chemicals, and materials used in the\nsemiconductor manufacturing process. We expect the heightened worldwide awareness regarding climate change and the\nenvironmental impact to continue, which may result in new environmental laws and regulations that could affect us, our\nsuppliers and/or our customers. New environmental laws and regulations could require us or our suppliers to obtain\nalternative materials that may increase our costs more or be less available, which may adversely affect our operating\nresults.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUncertainties arising out of economic consequences of current and potential military actions or terrorist\nactivities and associated political instability could adversely affect our business. Like other U.S. companies, our business\nand operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of economic consequences of current and potential military\nactions or terrorist activities and associated political instability, and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic\nand international travel and commerce. These uncertainties could also lead to delays or cancellations of customer orders,\na general decrease in corporate spending or our inability to effectively market and sell our products. Any of these results\ncould substantially harm our business and results of operations, causing a decrease in our revenues.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments. We have made, and in the future\nintend to make, acquisitions of, and investments in, companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new\nmarkets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited to:\n• inability to realize anticipated benefits, which may occur due to any of the reasons described below, or\nfor other unanticipated reasons;\n• the risk of litigation or disputes with customers, suppliers, partners or stockholders of an acquisition\ntarget arising from a proposed or completed transaction;\n• impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions,\ntechnological advancements or worse-than-expected performance, which would adversely affect our\nfinancial results; and\n• unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments, liabilities or issues not discovered in our\ndue diligence of such transactions.\n20\nWe also in the future may have strategic relationships with other companies, which may decline in value and/or\nnot meet desired objectives. The success of these strategic relationships depends on various factors over which we may\nhave limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. Moreover, these\nrelationships are often illiquid, such that it may be difficult or impossible for us to monetize such relationships.\nOur inability to successfully integrate, or realize the expected benefits from, our acquisitions could adversely\naffect our results. We have made, and in the future intend to make, acquisitions of other businesses and with these\nacquisitions there is a risk that integration difficulties may cause us not to realize expected benefits. The success of the\nacquisitions could depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings (if any) from combining\nthe businesses of the acquired companies and our business, which may take longer to realize than expected.\nSecurities laws and regulations, including potential risk resulting from our evaluation of internal controls over\nfinancial reporting, will continue to impact our results. Complying with the requirements of the federal securities laws\nand Nasdaq’s conditions for continued listing have imposed significant legal and financial compliance costs, and are\nexpected to continue to impose significant costs and management burden on us. These rules and regulations also may make\nit more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more\ndifficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors, particularly qualified\nmembers to serve on our audit committee. Further, the rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform\nand Consumer Protection Act, which became effective in 2011, may impose significant costs and management burden on\nus.\nAdditionally, because these laws, regulations and standards are expected to be subject to varying interpretations,\ntheir application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in\ncontinuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our\ndisclosure and governance practices.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nCybersecurity Risk Assessment, Identification and Management\nWe are committed to protecting our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure, including computers, systems,\ncorporate networks and sensitive data, from unauthorized access or attack. We have established global IT policies as well\nas IT security management control procedures designed to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats by:\n• Creating information security awareness among our employees and business partners and defining\nresponsibilities among them;\n• Implementing controls to identify IT risks and monitor the use of our systems and information resources;\n• Establishing key policies and processes to adequately and timely respond to security threats;\n• Maintaining disaster recovery and business continuity plans; and\n• Emphasizing compliance with applicable laws, regulations and contractual obligations regarding the\nmanagement of information security.\nThese policies and controls procedures discussed in more detail below, are an integrated component of our\nenterprise risk management assessment processes. We routinely review and assess our business groups and systems to\nidentify and prioritize areas of risk, including cybersecurity risk. The results of these assessments and progress against\nprioritized goals are presented to the board of directors each quarter.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur significant costs in order to implement, maintain, and/or update\nsecurity systems we believe are necessary to protect our IT infrastructure. We deploy technical safeguards that are designed\nto protect our systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention, and intrusion detection\nsystems. We have established disclosure controls and procedures to address cybersecurity events, which include elements\nrelating to comprehensive analysis of events and communication within the company, as well as addressing potential\ndisclosure obligations arising from security breaches.\n21\nWe have partnered with third parties to support our information security systems and processes, and to help\ndesign, build, test, implement and maintain them. Annual risk assessments are conducted by third party consultants to help\nensure that risks to our IT infrastructure are minimized or eliminated.\nWe rely on products and services provided by third parties for portions of our IT infrastructure, including business\nmanagement, operations and finance systems. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks on their products\nwhich may impact our systems. Further we may also face additional cybersecurity risk due to error or intentional\nmisconduct by contractors and other third-party service providers related to the use of these systems as part of our IT\ninfrastructure.\nWe have a third-party security policy in place to identify, manage and oversee the potential material risks from\nthreats associated with the use of third-party service providers. We evaluate vendors and consider amongst other factors\nthe criticality of services and sensitivity of information that is within the scope of the services to be provided and manage\nrisk accordingly. Our internal legal department reviews all IT Service Agreements with input from the IT department to\nensure that services, terms and conditions in the agreement are suitable. Our IT department performs regular monitoring\nof vendor services as part of its’ on-going review and monitoring of vendors. As part of our policy, we monitor termination\nof agreements with vendors designed to ensure that access to Company information is appropriately terminated in a timely\nmanner. Unauthorized network intrusions or other significant information security incidents against third-party systems\nused by the Company internally are handled in the same manner as internal systems. However as described in Part 1. Item\n1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Risks Related to the Operation and Growth of Our Business”,\nwe have limited insight into the data privacy or security of third-party service providers and our response may be limited\nor more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems.\nAlthough we believe we have adequate resources and sufficient policies, procedures, and oversight in place to\nidentify and manage IT security risks related to our business operations, there can be no guarantee that our policies and\nprocedures will be properly followed in every instance or that those policies and procedures will be effective. For a\ndescription of the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially affect the Company and how they may do so, see\nour risk factors under Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Risks Related to the\nOperation and Growth of Our Business.”\nManagement Oversight\nOur IT infrastructure and the assessment and management of associated risks are primarily the responsibility of\nour Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”). Our CISO’s additional responsibilities include hiring appropriate\npersonnel, helping to integrate cybersecurity risks into the Company’s overall risk management strategy, and\ncommunicating updates regarding IT/Information security key priorities to relevant personnel including management and\nthe board.\nOur CISO has served in that position since 2018. Our CISO has extensive experience serving in executive and\nsenior IT leadership positions over the past 25 years including serving at Cavium in a succession of information security\nroles, including Vice President of Business Systems, for eleven years, Vice President of IT Applications at ServiceNow\nfor two years, and overseeing worldwide IT Infrastructure, IT Operations and Information Security at Pinnacle Systems\nfor eight years.\nWe have in place an Incident Response Procedure policy to define our response to unauthorized network\nintrusions or other significant information security incidents, collectively cybersecurity incidents. The policy defines the\nstandard operational process to determine if an event observed on a system could have caused a breach of the system or a\ncompromise of sensitive data. This policy serves to establish a formal process to report incidents and track response\nactivities. It also defines escalation processes within the Information Security team and to our Cybersecurity Incident\nResponse Team. It is the responsibility of the Cybersecurity Incident Response team to determine if an incident is material.\nThe Cybersecurity Incident Response Team consists of members from functional groups across our organization including\nexecutive management, IT, Information Security, legal, finance and operations. We may include other individuals,\nincluding third parties, as appropriate depending on the nature of the incident and system(s) involved. This cross-functional\ngroup allows us to address the operational impacts of cybersecurity incidents as and when they occur and to guide decisions\nrelated to materiality and, if applicable, disclosure. The Cybersecurity Incident Response Team is responsible for\nextrapolating cybersecurity incident event information into quantitative and qualitative impacts as they relate to our\nfinancial condition and operations. In addition, the Company’s Incident Response Procedure policy includes reporting to\nthe board of directors for certain cybersecurity incidents.\n22\nBoard Governance\nOur full board of directors oversees our risk management including but not limited to IT and cybersecurity\npolicies, procedures, and risk assessments. Our management reports to our board of directors on information security\nmatters on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as needed.\nOne of the key functions of our board of directors is informed oversight of our various processes for managing\nrisk. An overall review of risk is inherent in our board of directors ongoing consideration of our long-term strategies,\ntransactions and other matters presented to and discussed by the board of directors. This includes a discussion of the\nlikelihood and potential magnitude of various risks, including cybersecurity risks, and any actions management has taken\nto limit, monitor or control those risks.\nAt each quarterly board meeting, the full board receives the quarterly cybersecurity board update that is prepared\nby our CISO. The report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity update for the past quarter, including topics such as\ndetails on threat landscape, incident response, security metrics and performance, compliance and regulatory updates,\ncybersecurity investments and budget, employee security awareness and trainings, vendor risk management updates,\nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery updates, and an update on cybersecurity strategy, projects and roadmap.\nItem 2. Properties.\nWe own our principal executive, administrative, manufacturing and technical offices which are located in San\nJose, California. We also own an R&D facility in New Jersey, a design center in Germany and a multipurpose office\nbuilding in Switzerland. We lease administrative office space in Singapore, R&D facilities in Canada, United Kingdom,\nthe Philippines and Malaysia, in addition to sales offices in various countries around the world to accommodate our sales\nforce. We believe that our current facilities are sufficient for our company; however, if headcount increases above capacity\nwe may need to lease additional space.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nInformation with respect to this item may be found in Note 13, Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, in our\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included later in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is\nincorporated here by reference.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\n23\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities.\nOur common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “POWI”.\nAs of January 31, 2024, there were approximately 60 stockholders of record. Because brokers and other\ninstitutions hold many of our shares on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders\nrepresented by these record holders.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nFrom time to time our board of directors has authorized the use of funds to repurchase shares of our common\nstock. In October 2022, our board of directors authorized the use of an additional $100.0 million for the repurchase of our\ncommon stock, with repurchases to be executed according to pre-defined price/volume guidelines.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $26.0 million available for future stock repurchases.\nAuthorization of future stock-repurchase programs is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and business conditions as well as other factors.

[Reserved]\n25\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between\n2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included in this\nForm 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The following discussion and analysis has been prepared as an aid to understanding our financial\ncondition and results of our operations. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and\nthe notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-\nlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”\nat the beginning of this Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-\nlooking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” and elsewhere\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nWe design, develop and market analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (“ICs”) and other electronic\ncomponents and circuitry used in high-voltage power conversion. Our products are used in power converters that convert\nelectricity from a high-voltage source to the type of power required for a specified downstream use. In most cases, this\nconversion entails, among other functions, converting alternating current (“AC”) to direct current (“DC”) or vice versa,\nreducing or increasing the voltage, and regulating the output voltage and/or current according to the customer’s\nspecifications.\nA large percentage of our products are ICs used in AC-DC power supplies, which convert the high-voltage AC\nfrom a wall outlet to the low-voltage DC required by most electronic devices. Power supplies incorporating our products\nare used with all manner of electronic products including mobile phones, computing and networking equipment,\nappliances, electronic utility meters, battery-powered tools, industrial controls, and “home-automation,” or “internet of\nthings” applications such as networked thermostats, power strips and security devices. Variations of our power-supply ICs\nare used for high-voltage power conversion in electric vehicles (“EVs”). We also supply high-voltage LED drivers, which\nare AC-DC ICs specifically designed for lighting applications that utilize light-emitting diodes, and motor-driver ICs for\nbrushless DC (“BLDC”) motors used in consumer appliances, HVAC systems, ceiling fans and a variety of industrial\napplications.\nWe also offer high-voltage gate drivers—either standalone ICs or circuit boards containing ICs, electrical\nisolation components and other circuitry—used to operate high-voltage switches such as insulated-gate bipolar transistors\n(“IGBTs”) and silicon-carbide (“SiC”) MOSFETs. These combinations of switches and drivers are used for power\nconversion in high-power applications (i.e., power levels ranging from approximately 100 kilowatts up to gigawatts) such\nas industrial motors, solar- and wind-power systems, EVs and high-voltage DC transmission systems.\nOur net revenues were $444.5 million and $651.1 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenues from all four\nend-market categories decreased in 2023 compared to the prior year. We believe that demand for our products has been\nnegatively affected by an array of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including reduced consumer spending in\nresponse to inflation and higher interest rates, softer housing markets, weaker demand for mobile phones, general economic\nweakness in China, the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and a shift in consumer spending toward travel and\nservices following a period of elevated spending on goods during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe these factors have\nexacerbated the effects of a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry; such downturns are commonly experienced\nin our industry following periods of strong growth during which supply chain participants tend to accumulate excess\ninventories.\nOur top ten customers, including distributors that resell to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers,\naccounted for approximately 80% and 76% of net revenues in 2023 and 2022, respectively. International sales represented\napproximately 98% and 96% of net revenues in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur business and financial performance depends significantly on worldwide economic conditions. We face global\nmacroeconomic challenges and risks including the effects of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, potential risks\nstemming from tensions between China and Taiwan and between China and Western countries, health crises such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, volatility in exchange rates, cyclical demand patterns common for our industry, inflation, tariffs\nand other risks associated with the global trade environment.\nBecause our industry is intensely price-sensitive, our gross margin (gross profit divided by net revenues) is subject\nto change based on the relative pricing of solutions that compete with ours. Variations in product mix, end-market mix\n26\nand customer mix can also cause our gross margin to fluctuate. Also, because we purchase a large percentage of our silicon\nwafers from foundries located in Japan, our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the\nU.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. All else being equal, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the\nJapanese yen would eventually result in a corresponding change in our gross margin of approximately 1.5%; this sensitivity\nmay increase or decrease depending on the percentage of our wafer supply that we purchase from Japanese suppliers. Also,\nalthough our wafer fabrication and assembly operations are outsourced, as are most of our test operations, a portion of our\nproduction costs are fixed in nature. As a result, our unit costs and gross profit margin are impacted by the volume of units\nwe produce.\nOur gross profit, defined as net revenues less cost of revenues, was $229.0 million or 52% of net revenues in 2023,\ncompared to $366.9 million or 56% of net revenues in 2022. Our gross margin decreased in 2023 due to a combination of\nfactors, including reduced production volumes, which impacted our manufacturing costs per unit, as well as a less\nfavorable end-market mix, with a greater percentage of revenues coming from lower-margin end markets and applications.\nTotal operating expenses in 2023 were $193.9 million, an increase of $7.4 million as compared to 2022 due to:\nhigher stock-based compensation expenses reflecting a lower-than-usual level of such expenses in the prior year; higher\nsalary- and benefit-related expenses reflecting annual salary increases and higher costs associated with employee health\ninsurance and other benefits.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis,\nwe evaluate our estimates, including those listed below. We base our estimates on historical facts and various other\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates.\nOur critical accounting policies are as follows:\n• revenue recognition;\n• estimating write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory.\nOur critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations,\nand require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. A brief description of our\ncritical accounting policies and material estimates is set forth below. For more information regarding our accounting\npolicies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in our Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue recognition\nProduct revenues consist of sales to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, merchant power supply\nmanufacturers and distributors. We apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10, Revenue\nfrom Contracts with Customers, and all related appropriate guidance. We recognize revenue under the core principle to\ndepict the transfer of control to our customers in an amount reflecting the consideration we expect to be entitled. In order\nto achieve that core principle, we apply the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer,\n(2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction\nprice to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\nSales to most distributors are made under terms allowing certain price adjustments and limited rights of return\n(known as “stock rotation”) of our products held in their inventory or upon sale to their end customers. We recognize\nrevenue from sales to distributors upon the transfer of control to the distributor. Frequently, distributors need to sell at a\nprice lower than the standard distribution price in order to win business. At the time the distributor invoices its customer\nor soon thereafter, the distributor submits a “ship-and-debit” price adjustment claim to us to adjust the distributor’s cost\nfrom the standard price to the pre-approved lower price. After we verify that the claim was pre-approved, we issue a credit\nmemo to the distributor for the ship-and-debit claim. In determining the transaction price, we consider ship-and-debit price\nadjustments to be variable consideration. At the time revenue is recognized on sales to distributors, future ship-and-debit\nprice adjustments are unknown and therefore subject to uncertainty. Such price adjustments are estimated using the\nexpected-value method based on an analysis of actual ship-and-debit claims, at the distributor and product level, over a\nperiod of time considered adequate to account for current pricing and business trends. The reserve for ship-and-debit\n27\nclaims decreased by $17.2 million between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, primarily due to lower inventory\nlevels held by distributors. Historically, actual price adjustments for ship-and-debit claims have not materially differed\nfrom those estimated when determining the transaction price. To the extent future ship-and-debit claims significantly\nexceed amounts estimated, there could be a material impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nStock rotation rights grant the distributor the ability to return certain specified amounts of inventory. Stock\nrotation returns are an additional form of variable consideration and are also estimated using the expected value method\nbased on historical return rates. Historically, these distributor stock rotation returns have not been material.\nEstimating write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory\nThe bulk of our inventory is held in wafers, which combined with the fungibility of our products across customers\nand applications results in a lower risk of obsolescence. We routinely monitor the quality of our on-hand wafers to ensure\nthat performance remains unchanged over time. When evaluating the adequacy of our provision for excess and obsolete\ninventory, we identify excess and obsolete products and also analyze historical usage, forecasted demand, current\neconomic trends and historical write-offs. This write-down is reflected as a reduction to inventory in the consolidated\nbalance sheets and an increase in cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of income. If actual market conditions\nare less favorable than our assumptions, we may be required to take additional write-downs, which could adversely impact\nour cost of revenues and operating results. Historically, these write-downs have not been material.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:\nYear E nded Decem be r 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet revenues ..................................................... 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of revenues .................................................. 48.5 43.7 48.7\nGross profit ...................................................... 51.5 56.3 51.3\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development ......................................... 21.6 14.4 12.1\nSales and marketing .............................................. 14.5 9.6 8.6\nGeneral and administrative ......................................... 7.5 4.4 5.7\nOther operating expenses, net ....................................... — 0.2 —\nTotal operating expenses ......................................... 43.6 28.6 26.4\nIncome from operations ............................................. 7.9 27.7 24.9\nOther income ..................................................... 2.4 0.5 0.2\nIncome before income taxes ......................................... 10.3 28.2 25.1\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes ...................................

Net revenues consist of revenues from product sales, which are calculated net of returns and\nallowances. Revenues from all four end-market categories decreased in 2023 compared to the prior year. We believe that\ndemand for our products has been negatively affected by an array of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including\nreduced consumer spending in response to inflation and higher interest rates, softer housing markets, weaker demand for\nmobile phones, general economic weakness in China, the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and a shift in consumer\nspending toward travel and services following a period of elevated spending on goods during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe believe these factors have exacerbated the effects of a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry; such downturns\nare commonly experienced in our industry following periods of strong growth during which supply chain participants tend\nto accumulate excess inventories.\nOur approximate net revenue mix by end-markets served in 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nEnd Market 2023 2022 2021\nCommunications ................................................. 29 % 21 % 30%\nComputer ....................................................... 12 % 10 % 10%\nConsumer ...................................................... 27 % 33 % 32%\nIndustrial ....................................................... 32 % 36 % 28%\n28\nSales to customers outside of the United States were $435.9 million and $625.6 million in 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, representing 98% and 96% of net revenues in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Although power supplies using\nour products are designed and distributed worldwide, most of these power supplies are manufactured by our customers in\nAsia. As a result, sales to this region accounted for approximately 84% and 75% of our net revenues in 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. We expect international sales to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nSales to distributors accounted for 69% and 70% of our net revenues in 2023 and 2022, respectively, with direct\nsales to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers accounting for the remainder in each of the corresponding years.\nThe following customers represented 10% or more of our net revenues for the respective years:\nCustomer 2023 2022 2021\nAvnet .......................................................... 27 % 31 % 30 %\nHonestar Technologies Co., Ltd. ..................................... 18 % 11 % 16 %\nSalcomp Group .................................................. 10 % * *\n* Total customer revenue was less than 10% of net revenues.\nNo other customers accounted for 10% or more of net revenues during these years.\nGross profit. Gross profit is net revenues less cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the\npurchase of wafers from our contracted foundries, the assembly, packaging and testing of our products by sub-contractors,\nproduct testing performed in our own facility, overhead associated with the management of our supply chain and the\namortization of acquired intangible assets. Gross margin is gross profit divided by net revenues. The following table\ncompares gross profit and gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(dollars in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Chang e 2021\nGross profit ....................................... $ 229.0 (37.6)% $ 366.9 1.7 % $ 360.6\nGross margin ...................................... 51.5% 56.3 % 51.3%\nOur gross margin decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to a combination of factors, including a less\nfavorable end-market mix, with a greater percentage of revenues coming from lower-margin end markets and applications\nand reduced production volumes, which impacted our manufacturing costs per unit.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of\nemployee-related expenses including salaries and stock-based compensation, as well as expensed material and facility\ncosts associated with the development of new processes and products. We also record R&D expenses for prototype wafers\nrelated to new products until the products are released to production. The following table compares R&D expenses for\nthe years ended years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(dollars in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Chang e 2021\nR&D expenses ..................................... $ 96.1 2.3 % $ 93.9 10.6 % $ 84.9\nHeadcount (at period end) ............................ 282 310 304\nR&D expenses increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to increased stock-based compensation\nexpense, higher salaries and related expenses due to annual salary increases and increased equipment-related expenses,\npartially offset by lower product development costs.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing (“S&M”) expenses consist primarily of employee-related\nexpenses, including salaries and stock-based compensation, and commissions to sales representatives, as well as\namortization of acquired intangible assets and facilities expenses, including expenses associated with our regional sales\nand support offices. The following table compares sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021:\n(dollars in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Chang e 2021\nSales and marketing expenses ......................... $ 64.6 3.2 % $ 62.6 2.9 % $ 60.8\nHeadcount (at period end) ............................ 317 320 280\n29\nS&M expenses increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses,\nincreased travel and trade show expenses, and increased stock-based compensation expense. These increases were partially\noffset by decreased commissions expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses consist primarily of\nemployee-related expenses, including salaries and stock-based compensation expenses for administration, finance, human\nresources and general management, as well as consulting, professional services, legal and auditing expenses. The table\nbelow compares G&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(dollars in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Chang e 2021\nG&A expenses ..................................... $ 33.2 15.0 % $ 28.9 (27.5)% $ 39.8\nHeadcount (at period end) ............................ 79 72 70\nG&A expenses increased in 2023 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses driven by increased\nheadcount and increased stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based awards. These increases were\npartially offset by recovery of bad debt and lower professional services expenses.\nOther operating expenses, net. Other operating expenses, net was $1.1 million in fiscal 2022. This amount\nconsisted of a $2.9 million expense resulting from the settlement of our litigation with Opticurrent LLC on May 16, 2022,\nin which we agreed to pay Opticurrent $2.9 million to end all outstanding legal disputes, partially offset by receipt of a\n$1.7 million distribution related to the bankruptcy liquidation of SemiSouth Laboratories, Inc., of which we were a creditor\nas a result of investments made in SemiSouth in 2011.\nOther income. Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents,\nmarketable securities and other investments, and the impact of foreign exchange gains or losses. The following table\ncompares other income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(dollars in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Chang e 2021\nOther income ...................................... $ 10.8 259.9% $ 3.0 179.9 % $ 1.1\nOther income increased in 2023 due primarily to an increase in interest income resulting from higher yields earned\non our investments.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes. Provision for income taxes represents federal, state and foreign taxes. The\nfollowing table compares the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(dollars in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Chang e 2021\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes .................... $ (9.8) (178.2)% $ 12.6 7.3 % $ 11.7\nEffective tax rate ................................... (21.4)% 6.9 % 6.7%\nIn 2023 and 2022, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income-tax rates of 21% due to\nthe geographic distribution of our world-wide earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, the impact of federal research tax credits\nand the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. Additionally, in 2023 and 2022, our\neffective tax rate was favorably impacted by the geographic distribution of our world-wide earnings in lower-tax\njurisdictions and federal research tax credits. In 2023, the rate was further favorably impacted by the release of $7.6 million\nof reserves related to federal uncertain tax positions as the statute of limitations for review of these positions expired.\nThese benefits were partially offset by U.S. tax on foreign income, known as global intangible low-taxed income. The\nprimary jurisdiction from which our foreign earnings are derived is the Cayman Islands, which is a non-taxing jurisdiction.\nIncome earned in other foreign jurisdictions was not material. We have not been granted any incentivized tax rates and do\nnot operate under tax holidays in any jurisdiction. For additional details, refer to Note 11, Provision for Income Taxes, in\nour Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had $311.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities at December 31, 2023\ncompared to $353.8 million at December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had working capital, defined\nas current assets less current liabilities, of approximately $462.7 million and $466.7 million, respectively.\nWe have a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the \"Credit Agreement\") that\nprovides us with a $75.0 million revolving line of credit to use for general corporate purposes with a $20.0 million sub-\nlimit for the issuance of standby and trade letters of credit. The Credit Agreement was amended on June 7, 2021, to provide\nan alternate borrowing rate as a replacement for LIBOR and extend the termination date from April 30, 2022 to\n30\nJune 7, 2026, with all other terms remaining the same. The Credit Agreement was amended with an effective date of\nJune 28, 2023 to include the Secured Overnight Financing Rates (“SOFR”) as interest rate benchmark rates, with all other\nterms remaining the same. Our ability to borrow under the revolving line of credit is conditioned upon our compliance\nwith specified covenants, including reporting and financial covenants, primarily a minimum liquidity measure and a debt\nto earnings ratio, with which we are currently in compliance. The Credit Agreement terminates on June 7, 2026; all\nadvances under the revolving line of credit will become due on such date, or earlier in the event of a default. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no advances outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nCash from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities generated cash of $65.8 million and $215.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. We generate cash primarily from operating activities in the ordinary course of business.\nIn 2023, our net income was $55.7 million, we also incurred $35.2 million of depreciation, $28.5 million of stock-\nbased compensation and $2.2 million of intangibles amortization partially offset by a $9.2 million increase in deferred\nincome taxes. Sources of cash also included a $6.6 million decrease in accounts receivable. These sources of cash were\npartially offset by a $27.7 million increase in inventories due to softening demand during the year, a $18.2 million decrease\nin taxes payable and accrued liabilities, a $5.4 million decrease in accounts payable (excluding payables related to property\nand equipment) due to timing of payments and a $1.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nIn 2022, our net income was $170.9 million, which included non-cash expenses of $34.9 million of depreciation,\n$22.4 million of stock-based compensation, $3.3 million for amortization of premium on marketable securities, $2.4\nmillion of intangibles amortization and a $2.6 million decrease in deferred income taxes. Sources of cash also included a\n$19.9 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $7.3 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets. These\nsources of cash were partially offset by a $36.2 million increase in inventories due to softening demand during the year\nand a $3.8 million decrease in accounts payable (excluding payables related to property and equipment) due to timing of\npayments and a $5.2 million decrease in taxes payable and accrued liabilities.\nCash from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted in a $14.2 million net use of cash,\nconsisting primarily of $20.9 million for purchases of property and equipment, primarily production-related machinery\nand equipment, partially offset by $6.7 million from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases.\nOur investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 generated $78.3 million of cash, consisting\nprimarily of $116.3 million from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, and proceeds of $1.2\nmillion from the sale of an office building, partially offset by $39.2 million for purchases of property and equipment,\nprimarily production-related machinery and equipment.\nCash from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023, resulted in a $93.0 million net use of cash.\nFinancing activities consisted primarily of $55.3 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $44.0 million for the\npayment of dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $6.2 million from the issuance of common stock\nthrough our employee stock purchase plan.\nOur financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022, resulted in a $346.4 million net use of cash.\nFinancing activities consisted primarily of $311.1 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $41.5 million for\nthe payment of dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $6.2 million from the issuance of common stock,\nincluding the exercise of employee stock options and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.\nDividends\nIn January 2022, our board of directors declared dividends of $0.18 per share to be paid to stockholders of record\nat the end of each quarter in 2022.\nIn February 2023, our board of directors raised the cash dividend with the declaration of four cash dividends of\n$0.19 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2023. In October 2023, our board of\ndirectors raised the cash dividend with the declaration of five cash dividends of $0.20 per share to be paid to stockholders\nof record at the end of the fourth quarter in 2023 (in lieu of the $0.19 per share announced in February 2023) and at the\nend of each quarter in 2024.\n31\nThe declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a\ndetermination that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders.\nStock Repurchases\nOver the years our board of directors has authorized the use of funds to repurchase shares of our common stock,\nincluding $100.0 million in January 2022, $50.0 million in February 2022, $75.0 million in April 2022 and $100.0 million\nin October 2022 with repurchases to be executed according to pre-defined price/volume guidelines. In 2022, we\nrepurchased 3.8 million shares for $311.1 million, leaving $81.3 million in funds authorized as of December 31, 2022.\nIn 2023, we repurchased 0.8 million shares for $55.3 million, leaving $26.0 million in funds authorized as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAuthorization of future stock repurchase programs is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend\non our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and business conditions as well as other factors.\nCapital Expenditures\nCash paid for property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2023 was $20.9 million. We expect capital\nexpenditures in fiscal 2024 to be primarily for machinery and equipment for use in the manufacture of our products to\nsupport future growth. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with cash on hand as well as cash provided by future\noperations.\nOther Information\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may change in future periods due to changes in our planned\ncash outlays, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to future acquisitions. The\nTax Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 generally allows companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings\nwithout incurring additional U.S. federal taxes beginning after December 31, 2017. Accordingly, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, our worldwide cash and marketable securities are available to fund capital allocation needs, including\ncapital and internal investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases and/or dividends without incurring significant U.S. federal\nincome taxes.\nIf our operating results deteriorate in future periods, either as a result of a decrease in customer demand or pricing\npressures from our customers or our competitors, or for other reasons, our ability to generate positive cash flow from\noperations may be jeopardized. In that case, we may be forced to use our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments,\nuse our current financing or seek additional financing from third parties to fund our operations. We believe that cash\ngenerated from operations, together with existing sources of liquidity, will satisfy our projected working capital and other\ncash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our uses of cash beyond the next 12 months will depend on many\nfactors, including the general economic environment in which we operate and our ability to generate cash flow from\noperations, which are uncertain but include funding our operations and additional capital expenditures.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements or relationships with\nunconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose\nentities, which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance-sheet arrangements or other contractually\nnarrow or limited purposes.\n32\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had the following non-cancelable contractual obligations:\nPaymentsDueby Pe r iod\nLessthan1\n(In thousands) Total Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years Over 5 Years\nOperating lease obligations(1) .................... $ 11,239 $ 3,168 $ 5,617 $ 2,211 $ 243\nPurchase obligations(2) .......................... $ 41,585 $ 41,585 $ — $ — $ —\n(1) Operating lease obligations represent undiscounted non-cancelable remaining lease payments.\n(2) Purchase obligations represent commitments to our suppliers and other parties for the purchases of goods and services, which\nprimarily consist of wafer and other inventory purchases, assembly and other manufacturing services, and purchases of property\nand equipment.\nIn addition to operating lease and purchase obligations, we have a contractual obligation related to income tax as\nof December 31, 2023, which primarily comprises unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $16.4 million, and was\nclassified as contra deferred tax assets or long-term income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 we also had approximately $1.7 million classified as long-term income taxes payable related to the\nestimated one-time transition tax from the enactment of the Tax Act which will be payable in three remaining annual\ninstallments. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with existing sources of liquidity, will satisfy the\ncash requirements for these contractual obligations.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor recently issued accounting announcements, see “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 2,\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment\nportfolio. We consider cash invested in highly liquid financial instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or\nless at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities greater\nthan three months are classified as short-term investments. We generally hold securities until maturity; however, they may\nbe sold under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, when necessary for the funding of acquisitions and other\nstrategic investments. As a result of this policy, we classify our investment portfolio as available-for-sale. We invest in\nhigh-credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our policy,\nwe seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and\nreinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high-credit quality securities and by constantly\npositioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer,\nguarantor or depository. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to\nfacilitate portfolio liquidity. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we held primarily cash equivalents and short-term\ninvestments with fixed interest rates. We do not hold any instruments for trading purposes.\nOur investment securities are subject to market interest rate risk and will vary in value as market interest rates\nfluctuate. To minimize market risk, we invest in high-credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit\nexposure to any one issuer, and therefore if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10% from interest rates\nas of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022, the increase or decrease in the fair market value of our portfolio on these\ndates would not have been material. We monitor our investments for impairment on a periodic basis. Refer to Note 5,\nMarketable Securities, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a\ntabular presentation of our available-for-sale investments and the expected maturity dates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk. As of December 31, 2023, our primary transactional currency was the U.S.\ndollar; in addition, we hold cash in Swiss francs and euros to fund the operation of our Swiss subsidiary. Cash balances\nheld in foreign countries are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the\nUnited States. The following represents the potential impact on our pretax income from a change in the value of the U.S.\n33\ndollar compared to the Swiss franc and euro as of December 31, 2023. This sensitivity analysis applies a change in the\nU.S. dollar value of 5% and 10%.\nDecemb er31,2023\n(in thousands of USD) 5% 10%\nSwiss franc and euro foreign exchange impact ......................................... $ 125 $ 250\nThe foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the U.S. dollar versus the Swiss franc and euro is recorded in other\nincome in our consolidated statements of income.\nWe have R&D and sales offices in various other foreign countries in which our expenses are denominated in the\nlocal currency, primary Asia and Western Europe. From time to time we may enter into foreign currency hedging contracts\nto hedge certain foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have an open foreign\ncurrency hedge program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts.\nWith two of our major suppliers, Seiko Epson Corporation (“Epson”) and ROHM Lapis Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n(“Lapis”) we have wafer supply agreements based in U.S. dollars; however, our agreements with Epson and Lapis also\nallow for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar.\nEach year, our management and these suppliers review and negotiate pricing; the negotiated pricing is denominated in\nU.S. dollars but is subject to contractual exchange rate provisions. The fluctuation in the exchange rate is shared equally\nbetween us and each of these suppliers.\nNevertheless, as a result of our above-mentioned supplier agreements, our gross margin is influenced by\nfluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. All else being equal, a 10% change in the\nvalue of the U.S. dollar compared to the Japanese yen would eventually result in a corresponding change in our gross\nmargin of approximately 1.5%; this sensitivity may increase or decrease depending on the percentage of our wafer supply\nthat we purchase from some of our Japanese suppliers and could subject our gross profit and operating results to the\npotential for material fluctuations.\n34\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Power Integrations, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Power Integrations, Inc. and subsidiaries (the\n\"Company\") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,\nstockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related\nnotes and schedules listed in the Index at Item 8 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the\nfinancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInventories – Provision for Excess and Obsolete Inventory – Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company's inventories are recorded at standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis, not\nin excess of net realizable value. The Company routinely evaluates quantities and values of inventories and records a\nprovision for excess and obsolete inventories to reduce its recorded inventory balance to its estimated net realizable value.\nManagement’s assumptions regarding the inventory quantities considered to be excess and obsolete are determined by\nanalyzing historical usage, demand forecasts, current economic trends, and historical write-offs.\nWe identified the determination of excess and obsolete inventory within work-in-process and finished goods inventory as\na critical audit matter due to the significant assumptions made by management when determining the excess and obsolete\ninventory quantities and the resulting provision. This required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent\n35\nof effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s excess and obsolete provision\nfor work-in-process and finished goods inventory.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s assumptions used in determining the excess and obsolete provision for\nwork-in-process and finished goods inventory included the following, among others:\n• We tested the effectiveness of the control over the determination of the provision for excess and obsolete\ninventories, including work-in-process and finished goods inventory.\n• We selected a sample of products from work-in-process and finished goods inventory as of\nDecember 31, 2022, and evaluated management's ability to accurately estimate forecasted demand by\ncomparing the respective products usage for the year ended December 31, 2023, to estimates made in\nthe prior year.\n• We selected a sample of products from work-in-process and finished goods inventory and evaluated the\nreasonableness of management's provision for work-in-process and finished goods inventory by\nconsidering recent usage, historical usage, contracts and communications with customers, expected\nproduct lifecycles, macroeconomic conditions, and inquiries with sales personnel.\n• We considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal communications to\nmanagement and the board of directors, Company press releases, and analyst reports, as well as our\nobservations and inquiries as to changes within the business.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 12, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\n36\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents ............................................. $ 63,929 $ 105,372\nShort-term marketable securities ........................................ 247,640 248,441\nAccounts receivable, net ............................................... 14,674 20,836\nInventories .......................................................... 163,164 135,420\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets ................................. 22,193 15,004\nTotal current assets .................................................. 511,600 525,073\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, net .................................... 164,213 176,681\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS, net ............................................ 4,424 6,597\nGOODWILL ......................................................... 91,849 91,849\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS ............................................. 28,325 19,034\nOTHER ASSETS ..................................................... 19,457 20,862\nTotal assets ........................................................ $ 819,868 $ 840,096\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable .................................................... $ 26,390 $ 30,088\nAccrued payroll and related expenses .................................... 13,551 14,778\nTaxes payable ....................................................... 1,016 938\nOther accrued liabilities ............................................... 7,910 12,572\nTotal current liabilities ............................................... 48,867 58,376\nLONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE.............................. 6,244 15,757\nOTHER LIABILITIES ................................................. 12,516 10,747\nTotal liabilities ..................................................... 67,627 84,880\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Notes 11, 12 and 13)\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value\nAuthorized - 140,000 shares\nOutstanding - 56,738 and 56,961 shares in 2023 and 2022, respectively ...... 23 24\nAdditional paid-in capital .............................................. — —\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss ..................................

THE COMPANY:\nPower Integrations, Inc. (“Power Integrations” or the “Company”), incorporated in California on March 25, 1988,\nand reincorporated in Delaware in December 1997, designs, develops, manufactures and markets analog and mixed-signal\nintegrated circuits (“ICs”) and other electronic components and circuitry used in high-voltage power conversion. The\nCompany’s products are used in power converters that convert electricity from a high-voltage source to the type of power\nrequired for a specified downstream use. In most cases, this conversion entails, among other functions, converting\nalternating current (“AC”) to direct current (“DC”) or vice versa, reducing or increasing the voltage, and regulating the\noutput voltage and/or current according to the customer’s specifications.\nA large percentage of the Company’s products are ICs used in AC-DC power supplies, which convert the high-\nvoltage AC from a wall outlet to the low-voltage DC required by most electronic devices. Power supplies incorporating\nthe Company’s products are used with all manner of electronic products including mobile phones, computing and\nnetworking equipment, appliances, electronic utility meters, battery-powered tools, industrial controls, and “home-\nautomation,” or “internet of things” applications such as networked thermostats, power strips and other building-\nautomation and security devices. The Company also supplies high-voltage LED drivers, which are AC-DC ICs specifically\ndesigned for lighting applications that utilize light-emitting diodes, and motor-drivers ICs for brushless DC (“BLDC”)\nmotors used in consumer appliances, HVAC systems, ceiling fans and a variety of industrial applications. The Company\nalso offers high-voltage gate drivers—either standalone ICs or circuit boards containing ICs, electrical isolation\ncomponents and other circuitry—used to operate high-voltage switches such as insulated-gate bipolar transistors\n(“IGBTs”) and silicon-carbide (“SiC”) MOSFETs. These combinations of switches and drivers are used for power\nconversion in high-power applications (i.e., power levels ranging from approximately 100 kilowatts up to gigawatts) such\nas industrial motors, solar- and wind-power systems, electric vehicles and high-voltage DC transmission systems.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company is organized and operates as one reportable segment, the design, development, manufacture and\nmarketing of integrated circuits and related components for use primarily in the high-voltage power conversion markets.\nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information presented on\na consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries\nafter elimination of all intercompany transactions and balances.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing\nbasis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowances for receivables,\ninventories, litigation and income taxes. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other factors, which the\nCompany believes to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made. However, as the effects of future events cannot be\ndetermined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from management’s estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company applies the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606-10, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers, and all related appropriate guidance. The Company recognizes revenue under the core principle\nto depict the transfer of control to the Company’s customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects\nto be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach: (1) identify\nthe contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price,\n42\n(4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a\nperformance obligation is satisfied.\nProduct revenues consist of sales to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, merchant power supply\nmanufacturers and distributors. The Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by\nmaster sales agreements, to be the contracts with a customer. In situations where sales are to a distributor, the Company\nhas concluded that its contracts are with the distributor as the Company holds a contract bearing enforceable rights and\nobligations only with the distributor. As part of its consideration of the contract, the Company evaluates certain factors\nincluding the customer’s ability to pay (or credit risk). For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer\nproducts, each of which is distinct, to be the identified performance obligations. In determining the transaction price the\nCompany evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the\nCompany expects to be entitled. As the Company’s standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company has\nelected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing\ncomponent. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product based on their relative standalone selling\nprice. The product price as specified on the purchase order is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable\ninput which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances. Revenue is recognized when control\nof the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied), which typically\noccurs at shipment. Further, in determining whether control has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present\nright to payment and legal title, along with risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer.\nFrequently, the Company receives orders for products to be delivered over multiple dates that may extend across\nseveral reporting periods. The Company invoices for each delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenues for each\ndistinct product delivered, assuming transfer of control has occurred. As scheduled delivery dates are within one year,\nunder the optional exemption provided by ASC 606-10-50-14 revenues allocated to future shipments of partially completed\ncontracts are not disclosed. The Company has also elected the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 to expense\ncommissions when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise\nrecognized is less than one year.\nSales to international customers that are shipped from the Company’s facility outside of the United States are\npursuant to EX Works, or EXW, shipping terms, meaning that control of the product transfers to the customer upon\nshipment from the Company’s foreign warehouse. Sales to international customers that are shipped from the Company’s\nfacility in California are pursuant to Delivered at Frontier, or DAF, shipping terms. As such, control of the product passes\nto the customer when the shipment reaches the destination country and revenue is recognized upon the arrival of the\nproduct in that country. Shipments to customers in the Americas are pursuant to Free on Board, or FOB, point of origin\nshipping terms meaning that control is passed to the customer upon shipment.\nSales to most distributors are made under terms allowing certain price adjustments and limited rights of return\n(known as “stock rotation”) of the Company’s products held in their inventory or upon sale to their end customers. Revenue\nfrom sales to distributors is recognized upon the transfer of control to the distributor. Frequently, distributors need to sell\nat a price lower than the standard distribution price in order to win business. At the time the distributor invoices its customer\nor soon thereafter, the distributor submits a “ship-and-debit” price adjustment claim to the Company to adjust the\ndistributor’s cost from the standard price to the pre-approved lower price. After the Company verifies that the claim was\npre-approved, a credit memo is issued to the distributor for the ship-and-debit claim. In determining the transaction price,\nthe Company considers ship-and-debit price adjustments to be variable consideration. Such price adjustments are estimated\nusing the expected value method based on an analysis of actual ship-and-debit claims, at the distributor and product level,\nover a period of time considered adequate to account for current pricing and business trends. Historically, actual price\nadjustments for ship-and-debit claims have not materially differed from those estimated and included when determining\nthe transaction price. Stock rotation rights grant the distributor the ability to return certain specified amounts of inventory.\nStock rotation adjustments are an additional form of variable consideration and are also estimated using the expected value\nmethod based on historical return rates. Historically, distributor stock rotation adjustments have not been material.\nSales to certain distributors are made under terms that do not include rights of return or price concessions after\nthe product is shipped to the distributor. Accordingly, upon application of steps one through five above, product revenue\nis recognized upon shipment and transfer of control.\nThe Company generally provides an assurance warranty that its products will substantially conform to the\npublished specifications for twelve months from the date of shipment. The Company’s liability is limited to either a credit\nequal to the purchase price or replacement of the defective part. Returns under warranty have historically been immaterial.\nAs such, the Company does not record a specific warranty reserve or consider activities related to such warranty, if any,\nto be a separate performance obligation.\n43\nInventories\nInventories (which consist of costs associated with the purchases of wafers from domestic and offshore foundries\nand of packaged components from offshore assembly manufacturers, as well as internal labor and overhead associated\nwith the testing of both wafers and packaged components).\nInventory is recorded at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not\nin excess of net realizable value. The Company routinely evaluates quantities and values of inventories and records a\nprovision for excess and obsolete inventories to reduce its recorded inventory balance to its estimated net realizable value.\nIn order to determine the provision management considers historical usage, forecasted demand, current economic trends\nand historical write-offs.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome-tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year based\non reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carry-\nforwards that are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under the provisions\nof ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, utilizing the tax rates that are expected to\napply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The\nCompany limits the deferred tax assets recognized related to certain officers’ compensation to amounts that it estimates\nwill be deductible in future periods based upon Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). The Company also recognizes\nvaluation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets to the amount that it estimates will more likely than not be realized\nbased on available evidence and management’s judgment. In the event that the Company determines, based on available\nevidence and management judgment, that all or part of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, it would\nrecord a valuation allowance in the period the determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves\nsignificant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these\nuncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the Company’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s\nresults of operations and financial position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters\nas income tax expense.\nThe U.S. tax rules require U.S. tax on foreign earnings, known as global intangible low taxed income. Under U.S.\nGAAP, we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions as a\ncurrent-period expense when incurred (the “period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s\nmeasurement of its deferred taxes (the “deferred method”). We selected the deferred method of accounting and recorded\nthe associated basis differences anticipated to influence prospective income inclusion calculations.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and the Company’s domain name are evaluated in accordance with ASC 350-10, Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets, and an impairment analysis is conducted on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators exist for a potential\nimpairment.\nIn accordance with ASC 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, long-lived\nassets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held\nand used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows\nexpected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an\nimpairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the\nasset.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers cash invested in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or\nless at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n44\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company generally holds securities until maturity; however, they may be sold under certain circumstances\nincluding, but not limited to, when necessary for the funding of acquisitions and other strategic investments. As a result,\nthe Company classifies its investment portfolio as available-for-sale. The Company classifies all investments with a\nmaturity date greater than three months at the date of purchase as short-term marketable securities in its consolidated\nbalance sheet. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s marketable securities consisted primarily of commercial\npaper, corporate bonds, government securities and/or other high-quality commercial securities.\nEmployee Benefits Plan\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan for all employees in the United States who meet certain\neligibility requirements. Participants may contribute up to the amount allowable as a deduction for federal income tax\npurposes. The Company is not required to contribute; however, the Company contributes a certain percentage of employee\nannual salaries on a discretionary basis, not to exceed an established threshold. The Company provided for a contribution\nof approximately $2.1 million, $2.0 million and $1.9 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRetirement Benefit Obligations (Pension)\nThe Company recognizes the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit pension or post-retirement\nplan as an asset or liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Actuarial gains and losses are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity, and are amortized as a component of net\nperiodic cost over the remaining estimated service period of participants.\nForeign Currency Risk and Foreign Currency Translation\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s primary transactional currency was U.S. dollars; in addition, the\nCompany holds cash in Swiss francs and euros to fund the operations of the Company’s Swiss subsidiary. The foreign\nexchange rate fluctuation between the U.S. dollar versus the Swiss franc and euro is recorded in other income in the\nconsolidated statements of income.\nGains and losses arising from the remeasurement of non-functional currency balances are recorded in other\nincome in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company recognized a loss of $0.4 million in 2023,\nan immaterial foreign exchange loss in 2022 and a loss of $0.6 million in 2021.\nThe functional currencies of the Company’s other subsidiaries are the local currencies. Accordingly, all assets\nand liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates as of the applicable balance sheet date. Revenues\nand expenses are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing during the period. Cumulative gains and losses from\nthe translation of the foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements have been included accumulated other comprehensive loss\nin stockholders’ equity.\nWarranty\nThe Company generally warrants that its products will substantially conform to the published specifications for\n12 months from the date of shipment. The Company’s liability is limited to either a credit equal to the purchase price or\nreplacement of the defective part. Returns under warranty have historically been immaterial, and as a result, the Company\ndoes not record a specific warranty reserve.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $1.3 million, $1.4 million and $1.3 million in 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nIndemnifications\nThe Company sells products to its distributors under contracts, collectively referred to as Distributor Sales\nAgreements (“DSA”). Each DSA contains the relevant terms of the contractual arrangement with the distributor, and\n45\ngenerally includes certain provisions for indemnifying the distributor against losses, expenses, and liabilities from damages\nthat may be awarded against the distributor in the event the Company’s products are found to infringe upon a patent,\ncopyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party (Customer Indemnification). The DSA generally limits the\nscope of and remedies for the Customer Indemnification obligations in a variety of industry-standard respects, including,\nbut not limited to, limitations based on time and geography, and a right to replace an infringing product. The Company\nalso, from time to time, has granted a specific indemnification right to individual customers.\nThe Company believes its internal development processes and other policies and practices limit its exposure\nrelated to such indemnifications. In addition, the Company requires its employees to sign a proprietary information and\ninventions agreement, which assigns the rights to its employees’ development work to the Company. To date, the Company\nhas not had to reimburse any of its distributors or customers for any losses related to these indemnifications and no material\nclaims were outstanding as of December 31, 2023. For several reasons, including the lack of prior indemnification claims\nand the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases, the Company cannot determine the maximum\namount of potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnifications.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements and\nexpand public entities’ segment disclosures in the annual and interim financial statements. The amendment will require\ndisclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and within\neach reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items and\ninterim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. All disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 are\nrequired for entities with a single reportable segment. The Company is required to adopt the amendments in fiscal year\n2024 for annual and retrospective reporting periods and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 for all interim and\nretrospective reporting periods; with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of adopting\nthese amendments on its consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect the amendment to have a\nmaterial impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose\n(1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax\nexpense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing\noperations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax\npayments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet\nbeen issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective\napplication is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\n3.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:\nASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements, clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As\nsuch, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants\nwould use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier\nvalue hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as\nquoted prices for identical assets in active markets; (Level 2) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are\nobservable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which\nrequires the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market\ndata, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.\nThe Company’s cash equivalents and investment instruments are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair-\nvalue hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing\nsources with reasonable levels of price transparency. The type of instrument valued based on quoted market prices in\nactive markets primarily includes money market securities. This type of instrument is generally classified within Level 1\nof the fair-value hierarchy. The types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs (Level 2 of the fair-value\nhierarchy) include investment-grade corporate bonds and commercial paper. Such types of investments are valued by using\na multi-dimensional relational model, the inputs are primarily benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes,\nissuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data including market research\npublications. The Company does not hold any instruments that would be classified within Level 3 of the fair-value\nhierarchy.\nThe fair value hierarchy of the Company’s cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, was as follows:\nFair Value Measureme nt a t\nDecember 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs\n(In thousands) Total Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2)\nCommercial paper ....................................... $ 20,275 $ — $ 20,275\nCorporate securities ...................................... 246,922 — 246,922\nMoney market funds ..................................... 491 491 —\nTotal ................................................ $ 267,688 $ 491 $ 267,197\n48\nFair Value Measureme nt a t\nDecember 31, 2022\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs\n(In thousands) Total Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2)\nCommercial paper ....................................... $ 58,683 $ — $ 58,683\nCorporate securities ...................................... 248,441 — 248,441\nMoney market funds ..................................... 363 363 —\nTotal ................................................ $ 307,487 $ 363 $ 307,124\nThe Company did not transfer any investments between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy in the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n5.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS:\nThe carrying amount of goodwill as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $91.8 million; there were no changes\nto goodwill in either of the respective fiscal years.\nIntangible assets consist primarily of developed technology, acquired licenses, and domain name and are reported\nnet of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company amortizes the cost of all intangible assets over the estimated useful life of the developed technology\nand technology licenses, which range from two to twelve years, with the exception of $1.3 million paid to acquire an\ninternet domain name. The Company acquired the rights to the internet domain name www.power.com, the Company’s\nprimary domain name; the cost to acquire the domain name has been recorded as an intangible asset and will not be\namortized as it has an indefinite useful life.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets was approximately $2.2 million, $2.4 million and $3.5 million in the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

STOCK PLANS AND SHARE BASED COMPENSATION:\nStock Plans\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had three stock-based compensation plans (the “Plans”) which are\ndescribed below.\n2007 Equity Incentive Plan\nThe 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (“2007 Plan”) was adopted by the board of directors on September 10, 2007, and\napproved by the stockholders on November 7, 2007, as an amendment and restatement of the 1997 Stock Option Plan\n(“1997 Plan”). The 2007 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock\nawards, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards, stock appreciation rights, performance-based (“PSU”) awards, long-term\nperformance based (“PRSU”) awards and other stock awards to employees, directors and consultants. The 2007 Plan\nexpired in September 2017 with no further grants to be made under this plan; however previous grants under this plan shall\nremain outstanding until they are exercised, vest, forfeited or expire.\n2016 Incentive Award Plan\nThe 2016 Incentive Award Plan (“2016 Plan”) was adopted by the board of directors on March 17, 2016 and\napproved by the stockholders on May 13, 2016. The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of RSU awards, PSU awards and\nPRSU awards. No other forms of equity-based awards, including stock options and stock appreciation rights, may be\ngranted under the 2016 Plan. As of December 31, 2023, 3.4 million awards have been issued, net of forfeitures or\ncancellations, and approximately 3.6 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2016\nPlan.\n1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan), eligible employees may apply accumulated\npayroll deductions, which may not exceed 15% of an employee’s compensation, to the purchase of shares of the\nCompany’s common stock at periodic intervals. The purchase price of stock under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85% of\nthe lower of (i) the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day of each offering period, or (ii) the\nfair market value of the Company’s common stock on the purchase date (as defined in the Purchase Plan). Each offering\nperiod consists of one purchase period of approximately six months duration. An aggregate of 7.5 million shares of\ncommon stock were reserved for issuance to employees under the Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2023, of the shares\nreserved for issuance, 6.9 million shares had been purchased and 0.6 million shares were reserved for future issuance under\nthe Purchase Plan.\nShares Reserved\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock reserved for\nfuture grant under all stock plans.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 718-10, Stock Compensation. Under the provisions of ASC 718-10,\nthe Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation in its financial statements over the requisite service\nperiod of the individual grants, which generally equals a four-year vesting period. The Company uses estimates of\nvolatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and forfeitures in determining the fair value of these awards\nand the amount of compensation expense to recognize. The Company uses the straight-line method to amortize all stock\nawards granted over the requisite service period of the award.\nThe following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense recognized in accordance with\nASC 718-10 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nYear E nd ed Decemb er 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCost of revenues ................................................. $ 1,692 $ 1,132 $ 2,359\nResearch and development ......................................... 10,939 10,428 12,127\nSales and marketing ............................................... 6,888 6,035 7,630\nGeneral and administrative ......................................... 9,009 4,769 15,493\nTotal stock-based compensation expense ............................. $ 28,528 $ 22,364 $ 37,609\n51\nThe following table summarizes total compensation expense related to unvested awards not yet recognized, net\nof expected forfeitures, and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\nUnrecognized Compensation Weighted Average\nExpense for Unvested Remaining Recognition\nAwards Period\n(In thousands) (In years)\nLong-term performance-based awards ........................ $ — —\nRestricted stock units ...................................... 46,856 2.66\nPurchase plan ............................................ 155 0.08\nTotal unrecognized compensation expense ..................... $ 47,011\nStock-based compensation expense in the year ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $28.5 million,\ncomprising approximately $23.4 million related to restricted stock units, $3.2 million related to performance-based awards\nand long-term performance-based awards and $1.9 million related to the Company’s Purchase Plan.\nStock-based compensation expense in the year ended December 31, 2022, was approximately $22.4 million,\ncomprising approximately $23.2 million related to restricted stock units, $1.9 million related to the Company’s Purchase\nPlan and a $2.7 million credit related to performance-based awards and long-term performance-based awards.\nStock-based compensation expense in the year ended December 31, 2021, was approximately $37.6 million,\ncomprising approximately $19.9 million related to restricted stock units, $15.7 million related to performance-based\nawards and $2.0 million related to the Company’s Purchase Plan.\nThe fair value of employees’ stock purchase rights under the Purchase Plan was estimated using the Black-\nScholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions used during the three years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021:\nYear En d ed Decem ber 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRisk-free interest rates .............................................. 5.15% 1.71 % 0.07%\nExpected volatility rates ............................................ 37% 41 % 41%\nExpected dividend yield ............................................ 0.90% 0.89 % 0.57%\nExpected term of purchase rights (in years) .............................. 0.49 0.50 0.50\nWeighted-average estimated fair value of purchase rights .................. $ 23.75 $ 21.63 $ 23.92\nNo options were granted or remain outstanding as of December 31, 2023. There were no options exercised during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 while total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021 were $0.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively.\nPSU Awards\nUnder the performance-based awards program, the Company grants awards in the performance year in an amount\nequal to twice the target number of shares to be issued if the maximum performance metrics are met. The number of shares\nthat are released at the end of the performance year can range from zero to 200% of the target number depending on the\nCompany’s performance. The performance metrics of this program are annual targets consisting of a combination of net\nrevenue, non-GAAP operating earnings and strategic goals.\nAs the net revenue, non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals are considered performance conditions,\nexpense associated with these awards, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the service period based on an\nassessment of the achievement of the performance targets. The fair value of these PSUs is determined using the fair value\nof the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant, reduced by the discounted present value of dividends expected\nto be declared before the awards vest.

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHIC NET REVENUES:\nCustomer Concentration\nThe Company’s top ten customers accounted for approximately 80%, 76% and 78% of revenues in 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. A significant portion of these revenues are attributable to sales of the Company’s products to\ndistributors of electronic components. These distributors sell the Company’s products to a broad, diverse range of end\nusers, including OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers. Sales to distributors in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were\n$307.4 million, $457.7 million and $525.7 million, respectively.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND CASH DIVIDENDS:\nCommon Stock Repurchases\nFrom time to time the Company’s board of directors has authorized the use of funds to repurchase shares of the\nCompany’s common stock. In October 2018, the Company’s board of director’s authorized the use of $80.0 million for\nthe repurchase of the Company’s common stock, and in each of April 2021 and October 2021, the Company’s board of\ndirectors authorized the use of an additional $50.0 million for the repurchase of the Company’s common stock. In January,\nFebruary, April and October 2022, the Company’s board of directors authorized the use of an additional $100.0 million,\n$50.0 million, $75.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, for the repurchase of the Company’s common stock, with\nrepurchases to be executed according to pre-defined price/volume guidelines.\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company purchased approximately 0.8 million shares, 3.8 million shares and 0.9\nmillion shares, respectively, for approximately $55.3 million, $311.1 million and $73.9 million, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had $26.0 million available for future stock repurchases.\nAuthorization of future stock repurchase programs is at the discretion of the Company’s board of directors and\nwill depend on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and business conditions as\nwell as other factors.\nCommon Stock Dividend\nThe following table presents the quarterly dividends declared per share of the Company’s common stock for the\nperiods indicated:\nYear E nd ed Decemb er 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nFirst Quarter ....................................................... $ 0.19 $ 0.18 $ 0.13\nSecond Quarter ..................................................... $ 0.19 $ 0.18 $ 0.13\nThird Quarter ....................................................... $ 0.19 $ 0.18 $ 0.13\nFourth Quarter ...................................................... $ 0.20 $ 0.18 $ 0.15\nThe Company paid approximately $44.0 million, $41.5 million and $32.6 million in cash dividends during 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn January 2021, the Company’s board of directors declared dividends of $0.13 per share to be paid to\nstockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2021. In October 2021, the Company’s board of directors raised the\nquarterly cash dividend with the declaration of five cash dividends of $0.15 per share (the first in lieu of the $0.13 per\nshare announced in January 2021) to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of the fourth quarter in 2021 and at the\nend of each quarter in 2022.\nIn January 2022, the Company’s board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend by an additional $0.03 per\nshare with the declaration of four cash dividends of $0.18 per share (in lieu of the $0.15 per share announced in\nOctober 2021) to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2022.\nIn February 2023, the Company’s board of directors declared dividends of $0.19 per share to be paid to\nstockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2023.

EARNINGS PER SHARE:\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average shares of common stock\noutstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average\nshares of common stock and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common\nequivalent shares included in this calculation consist of dilutive shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of outstanding\ncommon stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, the assumed issuance of awards under\n56\nthe stock purchase plan and contingently issuable performance-based awards, as computed using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nA summary of the earnings per share calculation is as follows:\nYear E nd ed Decemb er 31,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2021\nBasic earnings per share:\nNet income ....................................................... $ 55,735 $ 170,851 $ 164,413\nWeighted-average common shares ..................................... 57,195 57,801 60,327\nBasic earnings per share ............................................. $ 0.97 $ 2.96 $ 2.73\nDiluted earnings per share: (1)\nNet income ....................................................... $ 55,735 $ 170,851 $ 164,413\nWeighted-average common shares ..................................... 57,195 57,801 60,327\nEffect of dilutive awards:\nEmployee stock plans .............................................. 427 570 1,140\nDiluted weighted-average common shares ............................... 57,622 58,371 61,467\nDiluted earnings per share ............................................ $ 0.97 $ 2.93 $ 2.67\n(1) The Company includes the shares underlying performance-based awards in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the\nperformance conditions have been satisfied as of the end of the reporting period and excludes such shares when the necessary\nconditions have not been met. The Company has included in the 2023, 2022 and 2021 calculations those shares that were\ncontingently issuable upon the satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the end of the respective periods.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, no outstanding stock awards were determined to be anti-\ndilutive and therefore were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n11. PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES:\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under the provisions\nof ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, utilizing the tax rates that are expected to\napply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nU.S. and foreign components of income before income taxes were:\nYear E nd ed Decemb er 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nU.S. operations ..................................................... $ 2,995 $ 17,250 $ 241\nForeign operations ................................................... 42,912 166,176 175,894\nTotal income before income taxes ..................................... $ 45,907 $ 183,426 $ 176,135\nThe components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows:\nYear E nd ed Decemb er31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCurrent provision (benefit):\nFederal .......................................................... $ (1,193) $ 19,740 $ 23,648\nState ............................................................ 3 2 2\nForeign .......................................................... 1,331 1,079 1,608\n141 20,821 25,258\nDeferred provision (benefit):\nFederal ..........................................................

(2.3) — (0.1)\nTotal .......................................................... (21.4)% 6.9 % 6.7%\nThe Company’s effective tax rate is impacted by the geographic distribution of the Company’s world-wide\nearnings in lower-tax jurisdictions, federal research tax credits and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-\nbased payments. In 2023, the rate was further favorably impacted by release of $7.6 million of reserves related to federal\nuncertain tax positions as the statute of limitations for review of these positions expired. These benefits were partially\noffset by foreign income subject to U.S. tax, known as global intangible low-taxed income. The Company’s primary\njurisdiction where foreign earnings are derived is the Cayman Islands, which is a non-taxing jurisdiction. Income earned\nin other foreign jurisdictions was not material. The Company has not been granted any incentivized tax rates and does not\noperate under any tax holidays in any jurisdiction.\nThe components of the net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) were as follows:\nDecem ber 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nCapitalized R&D costs ........................................................ $ 30,886 $ 20,666\nOther reserves and accruals ..................................................... 861 2,516\nTax credit carry-forwards ...................................................... 28,223 26,154\nStock compensation ........................................................... 1,543 1,559\nCapital losses ................................................................ 141 150\nNet operating loss ............................................................ 2,269 2,217\nOther ...................................................................... 465 439\nValuation allowance ..........................................................

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent\nupon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.\nManagement considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income. In the event\nthat the Company determines, based on available evidence and management judgment, that all or part of the net deferred\ntax assets will not be realized in the future, the Company would record a valuation allowance in the period the\ndetermination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact\nof uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the\nCompany’s expectations could have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance primarily as a result of its\nCalifornia, New Jersey and Canada deferred tax assets as the Company believes that it is not more likely than not that the\ndeferred tax assets will be fully realized.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had utilized all of its federal research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had California research and development tax credit carryforwards\nof approximately $40.7 million (there is no expiration of research and development tax credit carryforwards for the state\nof California) and California net operating losses of $44.2 million which will begin to expire in 2032. As of\n58\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had Canadian scientific research and experimental development tax credit\ncarryforwards of approximately $3.8 million and New Jersey research and experimental development tax credit\ncarryforwards of approximately $0.8 million, which will start to expire in 2030 and 2029, respectively.\nThe Tax Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, generally allows companies to repatriate accumulated\nforeign earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal taxes beginning after December 31, 2017. Local foreign and\nU.S. states taxes may still be incurred upon repatriation. The Company has not provided for U.S. taxes on its undistributed\nearnings of foreign subsidiaries. The determination of the future tax consequences of the remittance of these earnings is\nnot practicable.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 740-10, relating to accounting for uncertain income taxes.\nReconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits:\nUnrecognized\n(In thousands) Tax Benefits\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at January 1, 2021 ............................................... $ 21,051\nGross increase for tax positions of current year ..................................................... 2,068\nGross decrease for tax positions of prior years ..................................................... —\nStatute of limitation release for tax positions of prior years ...........................................

An income tax benefit of $4.5 million, net of valuation allowance\nadjustments, would be recorded if fiscal year 2023 unrecognized tax benefits are recognized. The Company cannot\nreasonably estimate the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that could be adjusted in the next twelve months.\nThe Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in\nincome tax expense. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of $0.3 million and $1.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which have been recorded in long-term income taxes payable in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for the years\nthrough 2019. However, due to tax attributes, the IRS may calculate tax adjustments for the 2017 transition tax calculation\nfor positions taken prior to 2017 since it has an extended statute of limitations period totaling six years. The California\nFranchise Tax Board has started an audit for the Company’s tax years 2018 and 2019, it is currently ongoing.\n12. LEASES AND COMMITMENTS:\nFacilities and Leases\nThe Company owns its main executive, administrative, manufacturing and technical offices in San Jose,\nCalifornia. The Company also owns a research and development facility in New Jersey, a design center in Germany and a\nmultipurpose office building in Switzerland. The Company’s leases consist of operating leases for administrative office\nspaces, research-and-development facilities and sales offices in various countries around the world. The Company\ndetermines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. Some lease agreements contain lease and non-lease components,\nwhich are accounted for as a single lease component. Total lease expense was $3.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and $3.3 million in both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021; short-term and variable lease\nexpenses were not material during these periods.\n59\nBalance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nD e cember 31, December 31,\n(In thousands) Balance Sheet Classification 2023 2022\nRight-of-use assets\nOperating lease assets ..........................

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in lawsuits, or customers\nand distributors may make claims against the Company. In accordance with ASC 450 10, Contingencies, the Company\nmakes a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nOn January 6, 2020, the Company filed a complaint against CogniPower LLC in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Delaware for infringement of two of the Company’s patents and seeking a declaration of non-\ninfringement with respect to patents that CogniPower had charged the Company’s customers with infringing, based on\ncustomer use of the Company’s products. In response, CogniPower filed a motion to dismiss the Company’s declaratory\njudgment claims on the basis that CogniPower had not threatened the Company directly with suit. That motion was granted,\nso CogniPower’s claims for infringement initially went forward separately in their lawsuit against the Company’s\n60\ncustomers in the District of Delaware, but the Company filed a motion to intervene in that lawsuit and received a ruling\nallowing the Company to intervene in CogniPower’s customer lawsuit on February 1, 2021, and the parties thereafter\nagreed to dismiss the Company’s separate lawsuit against CogniPower. The remaining case is currently stayed, but the\nCompany recently filed a motion to amend its claims against CogniPower to include three additional patents that are in\nthe same family as the two CogniPower patents that are already in the lawsuit, after CogniPower accused the Company’s\ncustomers of infringing those three related patents in a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas. A ruling on the Company’s\nmotion is expected in the coming months, and the Company believes it has strong claims and defenses with respect to all\nof CogniPower’s asserted patents and intends to vigorously defend itself against CogniPower’s claims against the\nCompany’s technology, with appeals to follow if necessary.\nOn October 31, 2022, Waverly Licensing LLC filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of Texas. In its complaint, Waverly alleged that the Company was infringing one patent\npertaining to charging a battery-operated device. The Company believes it has strong claims and defenses, and intends to\nvigorously defend itself against Waverly’s claims, with appeals to follow if necessary. Because the Company believed that\nWaverly’s Texas complaint was improperly filed in the wrong court, the Company filed a motion to dismiss, and on\nNovember 30, 2022, the Company filed a complaint against Waverly Licensing LLC and related entities IP Edge LLC,\nMavexar LLC, and Array IP LLC in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking a declaration of\nnon-infringement with respect to a patent that Waverly charged the Company with infringing. The Texas court thereafter\ndismissed Waverly’s Texas complaint. The Company’s Delaware lawsuit is in its earliest stages, but on April 6, 2023, the\nDelaware defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on a series of covenants not to sue that the Delaware defendants filed\nwith the Court, with further proceedings on the Delaware defendants’ motion expected in the coming months.\nThe Company is unable to predict the outcome of legal proceedings with certainty, and there can be no assurance\nthat the Company will prevail in the above-mentioned unsettled litigations. These litigations, whether or not determined\nin the Company’s favor or settled, will be costly and will divert the efforts and attention of the Company’s management\nand technical personnel from normal business operations, potentially causing a material adverse effect on the business,\nfinancial condition and operating results. Currently, the Company is not able to estimate a loss or a range of loss for the\nongoing litigations disclosed above, however adverse determinations in litigation could result in monetary losses, the loss\nof proprietary rights, subject the Company to significant liabilities, require the Company to seek licenses from third parties\nor prevent the Company from licensing the technology, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition and operating results.\n14. RETIREMENT PLANS:\nThe Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan (Pension Plan) for its Swiss subsidiary in accordance with\nthe legal requirements of Switzerland. The plan assets, which provide benefits in the event of an employee’s retirement,\ndeath or disability, are held in legally autonomous trustee-administered funds that are subject to Swiss law. Benefits are\nbased on the employee’s age, years of service and salary, and the plan is financed by contributions by both the employee\nand the Company.\nThe net periodic benefit cost of the Pension Plan was not material to the Company’s financial statements during\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. At December 31, 2023, the projected benefit obligation was\n$11.4 million, the plan assets were $7.9 million and the net pension liability was $3.5 million. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe projected benefit obligation was $12.1 million, the plan assets were $8.2 million, and the net pension liability was\n$3.9 million. The Company has recorded the unfunded amount as a liability in its consolidated balance sheet at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, under the other liabilities caption. The Company expects to make contributions to the\nPension Plan of approximately $0.4 million during 2024. The accumulated unrealized actuarial activity on pension\nbenefits, net of tax, at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $1.6 million gain, $0.9 million gain and $0.7 million loss,\nrespectively. These amounts were reflected in Note 3 under the caption accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nIn accordance with the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic of ASC 715-20, Defined Benefits Plan, the\nCompany recognizes the over-funded or under-funded status of its defined post-retirement plan as an asset or liability in\nits statement of financial position. The Company measured the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the\nfiscal year-end.\n61\n15. BANK LINE OF CREDIT:\nOn July 27, 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association\n(the \"Credit Agreement\") that provides the Company with a $75.0 million revolving line of credit to use for general\ncorporate purposes with a $20.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby and trade letters of credit. The Credit\nAgreement was amended on April 30, 2018, to extend the termination date from July 26, 2019, to April 30, 2022, with all\nother terms remaining the same. The Credit Agreement was amended on June 7, 2021, to provide an alternate borrowing\nrate as a replacement for LIBOR and extend the termination date from April 30, 2022, to June 7, 2026, with all other terms\nremaining the same. The Credit Agreement was amended with an effective date of June 28, 2023 to include the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rates (“SOFR”) as interest rate benchmark rates, with all other terms remaining the same.\nThe Company’s ability to borrow under the revolving line of credit is conditioned upon the Company’s\ncompliance with specified covenants, including reporting and financial covenants, primarily a minimum cash requirement\nand a debt to earnings ratio. The Credit Agreement terminates on June 7, 2026; all advances under the revolving line of\ncredit will become due on such date, or earlier in the event of a default. The Company was compliant with all covenants\nand had no advances outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023.\n62\nSchedule II\nValuation and Qualifying Accounts\nThe Company maintains an allowance for the distributors’ ship-and-debit credits relating to the sell-through of\nthe Company’s products. This reserve is established using the Company’s historical ship-and-debit amounts and levels of\ninventory in the distributor channels.\nThe following is a summary of the activity in the allowance for ship-and-debit credits:\nBalance at\nBeginning Balance at End\n(In thousands) of Period Additions Deductions (1) of Period\nAllowance for ship-and-debit credits:\nYear ended December 31, 2021 ............................. $ 26,435 $ 311,443 $ (296,279) $ 41,599\nYear ended December 31, 2022 ............................. $ 41,599 $ 241,817 $ (230,232) $ 53,184\nYear ended December 31, 2023 ............................. $ 53,184 $ 202,159 $ (219,326) $ 36,017\n(1) Deductions relate to ship-and-debit credits issued which adjust the sales price from the standard distribution price to the pre-\napproved lower price.

Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement is required to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under\nthe Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable\nassurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report\non Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and\nExchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting, which consists\nof control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. To the extent\nthat components of our internal control over financial reporting are included within our disclosure controls and procedures,\nthey are included in the scope of our periodic controls evaluation. Based on our management’s evaluation (with the\nparticipation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,\nas defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\nreporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of our assets;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and\nexpenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and\ndirectors; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use\nor disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting\nobjectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human\ndiligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Because of\nsuch limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nManagement conducted an assessment of Power Integrations’ internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization (COSO) of the\nTreadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013.

In our opinion, the Company maintained,\nin all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company\nand our report dated February 12, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained\nin all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\nWe believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nand that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 12, 2024\n65\nItem 9B.

If you return your signed proxy card to us before the Annual Meeting, we will vote your\nshares as you direct.\n• To vote over the telephone, dial toll-free 1-800-652-VOTE (8683) in the United States or Canada using a touch-tone\nphone and follow the recorded instructions. You will be asked to provide Power Integrations’ number and control\nnumber from the enclosed proxy card or Notice.

Brokers and nominees can use their discretion to vote “uninstructed” shares with\nrespect to matters that are considered to be “routine,” but not with respect to “non-routine” matters. Under the applicable rules and\ninterpretations of the NYSE, “non-routine” matters are matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of stockholders, such\nas mergers, stockholder proposals, elections of directors (even if not contested), executive compensation (including any advisory\nstockholder votes on executive compensation and on the frequency of stockholder votes on executive compensation), and certain\ncorporate governance proposals, even if management supported. Accordingly, your broker or nominee may not vote your shares on\nProposals 1, 2 or 4 without your instructions but may vote your shares on Proposal 3.\nWhat if I return a proxy card or otherwise vote but do not make specific choices?\nIf you return a signed and dated proxy card or otherwise vote without marking voting selections, your shares will be voted, as\napplicable, “For” the election of all our seven nominees for director, “For” the advisory approval of executive compensation, and “For”\nthe ratification of the Audit Committee’s selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of\nPower Integrations for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2024; your shares will not be voted on the stockholder proposal for simple\nmajority vote. If any other matter is properly presented at the Annual Meeting, your proxy holder (one of the individuals named on your\nproxy card) will vote your shares using his or her best judgment.\n3\nWho is paying for this proxy solicitation?\nWe will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to these proxy materials, our directors and employees may also\nsolicit proxies in person, by telephone, or by other means of communication. Directors and employees will not be paid any additional\ncompensation for soliciting proxies. We may also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy\nmaterials to beneficial owners.\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one Notice or set of proxy materials?\nIf you receive more than one Notice or set of proxy materials, your shares may be registered in more than one name or in\ndifferent accounts. Please follow the voting instructions on the proxy cards in the proxy materials or Notices to ensure that all of your\nshares are voted.\nCan I change my vote or revoke my proxy after submitting my proxy?\nStockholder of Record; Shares Registered in Your Name\nYes. You can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the Annual Meeting. If you are the\nrecord holder of your shares, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways:\n• You may submit another properly completed proxy card with a later date.\n• You may vote again over the internet or by telephone.\n• You may send a timely written notice that you are revoking your proxy to Power Integrations’ Corporate Secretary at\n5245 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, California 95138-1002.\n• You may attend the Annual Meeting and vote at the Annual Meeting. Simply attending the Annual Meeting will not,\nby itself, revoke your proxy.\nYour most current proxy card or telephone or internet proxy is the one that is counted.\nBeneficial Owner; Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank\nIf your shares are held by your broker or bank as a nominee or agent, you should follow the instructions provided by your\nbroker or bank.\nWhen are stockholder proposals due for next year’s annual meeting?\nTo be considered for inclusion in next year’s proxy materials, your proposal must be submitted in writing by\nNovember 29, 2024, to our Corporate Secretary at 5245 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, California 95138-1002; provided, however, that if\nour 2025 annual meeting of stockholders is held before April 17, 2025, or after June 16, 2025, then the deadline is a reasonable amount\nof time prior to the date we begin to print and mail our proxy statement for the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders. If you wish to\nsubmit a proposal that is not to be included in next year’s proxy materials or nominate a director pursuant to our Bylaws, you must\nprovide specified information in writing to our Corporate Secretary at the address above by November 29, 2024, except that if our 2025\nannual meeting of stockholders is held before April 17, 2025, or after June 16, 2025, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be\nreceived not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement of the date of such\nmeeting is made. You are also advised to review our Bylaws, which contain a description of the information required to be submitted\nas well as additional requirements about advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nIn addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements under our Bylaws, to comply with the universal proxy rules, stockholders\nwho intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the Company’s nominees must provide in their notice any\nadditional information required by Rule 14a-19(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nHow are votes counted?\nVotes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting, who will separately count, with respect\nto the proposal to elect directors, votes “For,” “Withhold” and broker non-votes; and with respect to other proposals, votes “For,”\n“Against,” abstentions and, if applicable, broker non-votes. Abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect and will not be counted\ntowards the vote total for any proposal.\nWhat are “broker non-votes”?\nWhen a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” does not give instructions to the broker or nominee holding the shares\nas to how to vote on matters deemed by the NYSE to be “non-routine,” the broker or nominee cannot vote the shares. These unvoted\nshares are counted as “broker non-votes.”\n4\nHow many votes are needed to elect directors?\nUnder our Bylaws, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, which means that the director nominees with the greatest\nnumber of votes cast will be elected. Each stockholder may, in respect of each share held, cast one vote with respect to each vacancy\non the Board. There is no cumulative voting for the election of directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, each of the nominees has tendered an irrevocable resignation as a director, which resignation is conditioned\nupon both (A) such director failing to have received more “For” votes than “Withheld” votes in this election and (B) acceptance by the\nBoard of Directors of such resignation. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the nominees were required to tender the\nirrevocable resignations before the Board could nominate the nominees for re-election as director.\nIf, in an uncontested election such as this election, a director fails to receive more “For” votes than “Withheld” votes for\nelection, then, within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote, the Nominating and Governance Committee will act to\ndetermine whether to accept the director’s conditional resignation and will submit such recommendation for prompt consideration by\nthe Board, and the Board will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee’s recommendation. The Nominating and Governance\nCommittee and the Board may consider any factors they deem relevant in deciding whether to accept a director’s conditional resignation.\nHow many votes are needed to approve each of Proposals 2, 3 and 4?\nTo be approved, each of Proposals 2, 3 and 4 must receive a majority of the votes cast on the matter. If you “Abstain” from\nvoting, it will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposal. Broker non-votes will also have no effect.\nWhat is the quorum requirement?\nA quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present if stockholders holding at least a\nmajority of all of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting are present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. On the\nRecord Date, there were 56,877,055 shares outstanding and entitled to vote. Thus the holders of 28,438,528 shares must be present in\nperson or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting to have a quorum.\nYour shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your\nbroker, bank or other nominee) or if you attend the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the\nquorum requirement. If there is no quorum, the chair of the Annual Meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares present at the\nAnnual Meeting in person or represented by proxy may adjourn the Annual Meeting to another date.\nHow can I find out the results of the voting at the Annual Meeting?\nWe expect to announce the preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. In addition, final voting results will be published\nin a current report on Form 8-K that we expect to file with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting. If final voting\nresults are not available to us in time to file a Form 8-K within four business days after the Annual Meeting, we intend to file a Form 8-K\nto publish preliminary results and, within four business days after the final results are known to us, file an amendment to the Form 8-K\nto publish the final results.\nWhat proxy materials are available on the internet?\nThe proxy statement and annual report to stockholders are available at: http://www.edocumentview.com/POWI.\n5\nPROPOSAL 1\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nThe Board is elected annually at the annual meeting of stockholders. Vacancies on the Board may be filled only by persons\nelected by a majority of the remaining directors. A director elected by the Board to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the year,\nand until the director’s successor is duly elected and qualified. This includes vacancies created by an increase in the number of directors.\nAs of March 29, 2024, the Board will have seven members, all of whose terms of office expire at the Annual Meeting. Proxies\nmay not be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named.\nEach of the nominees listed below is currently a director of Power Integrations who was previously elected by the stockholders.\nIf elected at the Annual Meeting, each of these nominees would be elected and qualified to serve until the 2025 annual meeting of\nstockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, or, if sooner, until the director’s death, resignation or removal.\nIt is Power Integrations’ policy to encourage directors and director nominees to attend the Annual Meeting. All of the Company’s then\nnine directors attended the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders.\nAll elections shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast. Unless marked otherwise we will vote executed proxies\nreturned to us for the nominees named below. The seven nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected. If\na nominee receives more “Withheld” votes than “For” votes, then notwithstanding the election of that nominee, if the Board determines\nthat, based on the fact that the director received more “Withheld” votes than “For” votes, and the other facts it may deem relevant, the\nBoard may decide to accept the nominee’s conditional resignation previously submitted as required under our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines. See “How many votes are needed to elect directors?” in “Questions and Answers about These Proxy Materials and Voting”\nabove for a description of these guidelines. If any nominee becomes unavailable for election as a result of an unexpected occurrence,\nyour shares may be voted for the election of a substitute nominee proposed by Power Integrations. Each person nominated for election\nhas agreed to serve if elected. Power Integrations’ management has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable to serve.\nThis Proposal 1 is to elect the seven nominees as directors named herein. The biography of each of the nominees below contains\ninformation regarding such nominees as of March 22, 2024, including age, service as a director, business experience, director positions\nheld currently or at any time during the last five years, information regarding involvement in certain legal or administrative proceedings,\nif applicable, and the experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills of each director, including those that led to the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee’s and the Board’s conclusion that each nominee should continue to serve as a director of Power Integrations.\nWendy Arienzo, Ph.D., age 68, has served as a director of Power Integrations since April 2017.

The Board consults with Power Integrations’ counsel to ensure\nthat the Board’s determinations are consistent with all relevant securities laws and other laws and regulations regarding the definition\nof “independent,” including those set forth in the applicable Nasdaq listing standards, as in effect from time to time.\nConsistent with these considerations, after review of all relevant identified transactions or relationships between each director,\nor any of his or her family members, and Power Integrations, its senior management and its independent registered public accounting\nfirm, the Board has affirmatively determined that all of the directors who served during 2023, other than Mr. Balakrishnan, our president\nand chief executive officer, are independent directors within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq listing standards. In making this\ndetermination, the Board found that none of the directors or nominees for director other than Mr. Balakrishnan had a material or other\ndisqualifying relationship with Power Integrations. Mr. Balakrishnan, by virtue of being Power Integrations’ president and chief\nexecutive officer, is not an independent director.\nInformation Regarding the Board and Its Committees\nThe Board has adopted the Corporate Governance Guidelines to help assure that the Board will have the necessary authority\nand practices in place to make decisions that are independent of Power Integrations’ management. The guidelines are also intended to\nalign the interests of directors and management with Power Integrations’ stockholders. The Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth\nthe practices the Board will follow with respect to, among other things, Board composition and selection, Board meetings, executive\nofficer succession planning, Board committees, compensation, director stock ownership and director education and orientation.

Each of the committees has authority to engage legal counsel or other\nexperts or consultants, as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities. The Board has determined that each member of each\ncommittee meets the applicable rules and regulations regarding “independence” and that each member is free of any relationship that\nwould interfere with his or her individual exercise of independent judgment with regard to Power Integrations.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee oversees Power Integrations’ corporate accounting and financial reporting process. For this purpose, the\nAudit Committee performs several functions, including:\n• evaluates the performance of and assesses the qualifications of the independent registered public accounting firm;\n• determines and approves the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm;\n• determines whether to retain or terminate the existing independent registered public accounting firm or to appoint and\nengage a new independent registered public accounting firm;\n• reviews and approves the retention of the independent registered public accounting firm to perform any proposed\npermissible non-audit services;\n• monitors the rotation of partners of the independent registered public accounting firm on Power Integrations’ audit\nengagement team as required by law;\n• confers with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of internal\ncontrols over financial reporting;\n• establishes procedures, as required under applicable law, for the receipt, retention and treatment of whistleblower\ncomplaints received by Power Integrations regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and\nthe confidential and anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing\nmatters;\n• meets to review Power Integrations’ annual audited consolidated financial statements and quarterly financial\nstatements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm;\n• reviews and, if it determines appropriate, approves related person transactions;\n• reviews and discusses with management and, as appropriate, the independent auditor, the company’s major financial\nrisk exposures and the steps taken by management to monitor and control these exposures; and\n• adopts procedures for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, three directors compose the Audit Committee: Mr. Iyer, Mrs. Ganti and Mr. Vig. The\nBoard has adopted a written Audit Committee Charter which can be found on our website at www.power.com. The Audit Committee\nmet six times in 2023.\nThe Board annually reviews the Nasdaq listing standards definition of independence for Audit Committee members and has\ndetermined that all members of Power Integrations’ Audit Committee are independent (as independence is currently defined in\nRule 5605(c)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) of the Nasdaq listing standards). The Board has determined that each of Messrs. Iyer and Vig qualifies as\n10\nan “audit committee financial expert,” as defined in applicable SEC rules. The Board made a qualitative assessment of Messrs. Iyer’s\nand Vig’s level of knowledge and experience based upon their extensive experience, including as senior executive officers with financial\noversight functions.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee reviews and approves the overall compensation strategy and policies for Power Integrations.\nFor this purpose, the Compensation Committee performs several functions, including:\n• with respect to the chief executive officer, reviews and approves all compensation, including incentive-based\ncompensation and equity compensation awards while seeking to achieve an appropriate level of risk and reward, and\ndevelops and reviews annual performance objectives and goals relevant to compensation and awards and evaluates\nthe performance of the chief executive officer in light of these goals and objectives;\n• reviews incentive-based compensation plans in which our executive officers participate, and determines the salaries,\nincentive and equity compensation for executive officers, and oversees the evaluation of management;\n• approves all employment, severance, or change-in-control agreements, special or supplemental benefits, or provisions\nincluding the same, applicable to executive officers;\n• proposes the adoption, amendment, and termination of stock option plans, stock appreciation rights plans, retirement\nand profit-sharing plans, stock bonus plans, stock purchase plans, bonus plans, deferred compensation plans, and other\nsimilar programs;\n• grants rights, participation and interests in our compensation plans to eligible participants;\n• approves and periodically reviews the salary, bonus and equity award ranges for non-executive officers and other\nemployees, and authorizes the chief executive officer to approve compensation levels for such non-executive officers\nand other employees within such ranges;\n• reviews and approves such other compensation matters as the Board or the chief executive officer wishes to have the\nCompensation Committee approve;\n• reviews and recommends to the Board the compensation to be paid to our non-employee directors for their service on\nthe Board and its committees and any changes thereto, other than compensation received pursuant to automatic equity\naward grants under stockholder approved equity compensation plans;\n• reviews with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (included in this proxy statement) and considers\nwhether to recommend that it be included in proxy statements and other filings;\n• reviews and evaluates the results of advisory votes of the company’s stockholders regarding executive compensation;\nand\n• reviews with the chief executive officer the plans for succession to the offices of Power Integrations’ executive officers\nand makes recommendations to be considered by the Board with respect to the selection of appropriate individuals to\nsucceed to those positions.\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, three directors compose the Compensation Committee: Dr. Arienzo, Mr. Brathwaite and\nMs. Gioia. All members of the Compensation Committee are independent (as independence is currently defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of\nthe Nasdaq listing standards). The Board has adopted a written Compensation Committee Charter, which can be found on our website\nat www.power.com. The Compensation Committee met six times in 2023.\nCompensation Committee Processes and Procedures\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board determines all compensation for our executive officers, including our chief\nexecutive officer. The Compensation Committee also administers our compensation plans, including equity incentive plans, and makes\nrecommendations to the Board regarding the adoption, amendment, and termination of these compensation plans. The Compensation\nCommittee also analyzes, considers and recommends to the Board the compensation to be paid to our non-employee directors for their\nservice on the Board and its committees, other than compensation received pursuant to automatic equity award grants under stockholder-\napproved equity compensation plans.\nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to obtain advice or assistance from consultants, legal counsel, accounting or\nother advisors as appropriate, to perform its duties, and to determine the terms, costs and fees for such engagements, which are paid for\nby Power Integrations. The Compensation Committee also has full access to all books, records, facilities and personnel of Power\nIntegrations. The Compensation Committee may from time to time delegate duties or responsibilities to subcommittees or to one member\nof the Compensation Committee.\n11\nThe Compensation Committee meets as often as it deems appropriate, but not less frequently than once each year to review the\ncompensation and awards of the executive officers and other employees of Power Integrations, and otherwise perform its duties under\nits charter.\nOur chief executive officer, Mr. Balakrishnan, reviews with the Compensation Committee on a regular basis our compensation\nphilosophy and programs, including the compensation of the named executive officers, so that the Compensation Committee can\nrecommend any changes necessary to keep our compensation philosophy and programs aligned with our business objectives.\nMr. Balakrishnan makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation of the named executive\nofficers. The Compensation Committee also utilizes an outside compensation consultant to provide it with advice on competitive\ncompensation plans. The Compensation Committee considers, but is not bound to and does not always accept, management’s or the\noutside consultant’s recommendations with respect to executive compensation. The Compensation Committee discusses\nMr. Balakrishnan’s compensation with him, but deliberates and makes decisions with respect to Mr. Balakrishnan’s compensation\nwithout him present.\nMr. Balakrishnan attends some of the Compensation Committee’s meetings, but leaves the meetings as appropriate when\nmatters of executive compensation specific to him are discussed.\nFor 2023, the Compensation Committee engaged an independent compensation consulting firm, Radford, part of the Rewards\nand Solutions practice at Aon plc (“Aon”), to assist in the analysis of compensation survey data. Aon attended Compensation Committee\nmeetings from time to time and provided peer group analysis, feedback and recommendations to the Compensation Committee on\nexecutive compensation and director compensation. Aon was instructed to review compensation at peer companies for the named\nexecutive officers and the company’s directors, and to give comments and recommendations based on that review. Aon was also\nexpected to use its experience with the company and other similar companies and to apply judgment based on that experience. In addition\nto survey data, the Compensation Committee analyzes information reported in peer companies’ SEC filings for all elements of\ncompensation, including salary, cash incentive compensation and equity compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews on at\nleast an annual basis the six factors required by Nasdaq to be reviewed by the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation\nconsultant prior to receiving advice from the compensation consultant.\nSubject to business needs, the Compensation Committee’s policy is to grant restricted stock units (“RSUs”), to certain new\nemployees on the first trading day of the month following the date of hire. In addition, we make grants of annual performance stock\nunits (“PSUs”) and RSUs to continuing non-executive employees generally on the first day the company’s common stock trades on the\nNasdaq Global Select Market in April of such year, and the Compensation Committee makes grants to executive officers on the date of\nCompensation Committee action with respect to PSUs and RSUs.\nThe Board determines outside director compensation, after receiving the recommendations from the Compensation Committee\nand the same independent consultant engaged by the Compensation Committee and used by the Compensation Committee in connection\nwith determining executive officer compensation.\nA further description of the Compensation Committee processes and procedures and the specific determinations of the\nCompensation Committee with respect to executive compensation for fiscal year 2023 are described in greater detail in the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement.\nNominating and Governance Committee\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for recommending the nomination of directors to the Board and for\nestablishing and monitoring our corporate governance. For this purpose, the Nominating and Governance Committee performs several\nfunctions, including:\n• evaluates and recommends to the Board director nominees for each election of directors;\n• determines criteria for selecting new directors, including desired board skills and attributes, and identifies and actively\nseeks individuals qualified to become directors;\n• reviews and makes recommendations to the Board concerning qualifications and the appointment and removal of\ncommittee members;\n• develops, recommends for Board approval, and reviews on an ongoing basis the adequacy of Power Integrations’\ncorporate governance principles;\n• reviews, discusses and assesses the performance of the Board, including Board committees; and\n• considers Board nominees and proposals submitted by stockholders or proposals to be submitted by the company to\nthe company’s stockholders regarding corporate governance matters and makes recommendations to the Board\nregarding such matters, and establishes any policies, processes and procedures, including procedures to facilitate\nstockholder communication with the Board.\n12\nThe Board has adopted a written Nominating and Governance Committee Charter, which can be found on our website at\nwww.power.com. As of the date of this proxy statement, three directors compose the Nominating and Governance Committee:\nMessrs. Brathwaite and Iyer and Dr. Arienzo. The Nominating and Governance Committee met five times in 2023. All members of the\nNominating and Governance Committee are independent (as independence is currently defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq listing\nstandards).\nIn considering whether to recommend any candidates for inclusion in the Board’s slate of recommended director nominees,\nincluding candidates recommended by stockholders, the Nominating and Governance Committee applies the criteria set forth in Power\nIntegrations’ Corporate Governance Guidelines. These criteria include the candidate’s ability to read and understand financial\nstatements, age, personal integrity and ethics, relevant expertise upon which to be able to offer advice and guidance to management,\nhaving sufficient time to devote to the affairs of the company, demonstrated experience in his or her field, ability to exercise sound\nbusiness judgment, and having the commitment to rigorously represent the long-term interests of the company’s stockholders. In\naddition, when conducting its assessment, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers any criteria for director qualifications\nset by the Board, as well as diversity, skills, and such other factors as it deems appropriate given the current needs of the Board and the\ncompany to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability. When considering diversity, the Board and Nominating and\nGovernance Committee views “diversity” as diversity of experience and expertise. The Board and Nominating and Governance\nCommittee believe that having a Board diverse in experience and expertise enables the Board, as a body, to have the broad range of\nrequisite expertise and experience to guide the company and management and to fulfill its role of oversight and stewardship. However,\nneither the Board nor the Nominating and Governance Committee has developed a policy with respect to diversity in identifying\nnominees for director, other than as set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines to consider diversity when assessing nominees.\nIn the case of incumbent directors whose terms of office are set to expire, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews\nsuch directors’ overall service to the company during their term, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation,\nquality of performance, and any other relationships and transactions that might impair such directors’ independence. In the case of new\ndirector candidates, the Nominating and Governance Committee also determines whether the nominee should be independent for Nasdaq\npurposes, which determination is based upon applicable Nasdaq listing standards, applicable SEC rules and regulations and the advice\nof counsel, if necessary. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no\nparticular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees. The Nominating and Governance Committee then uses its\nnetwork of contacts to compile a list of potential candidates, but may also engage, if it deems appropriate, a professional search firm.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee conducts any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications\nof possible candidates after considering the function and needs of the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee meets to\ndiscuss and consider such candidates’ qualifications and then recommends a nominee to the Board by majority vote.\nTo date, the Nominating and Governance Committee has not paid a fee to any third party to assist in the process of identifying\nor evaluating director candidates. To date, the Nominating and Governance Committee has not received a timely recommended director\nnominee from a stockholder or stockholders holding more than 5% of our voting stock.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders who demonstrate,\nby written documentation, satisfactory to the Nominating and Governance Committee, that such stockholders hold outstanding shares\nof the company. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not intend to alter the manner in which it evaluates candidates,\nincluding the minimum criteria set forth above, based on whether the candidate was recommended by a stockholder or not. Stockholders\nwho wish to recommend individuals for consideration by the Nominating and Governance Committee to become nominees for election\nto the Board in 2025 may do so by delivering a written recommendation to the Nominating and Governance Committee at the following\naddress: 5245 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, California 95138-1002 by November 29, 2024. Submissions must include the full name of the\nproposed nominee, a description of the proposed nominee’s business experience for at least the previous five years, complete\nbiographical information, and a description of the proposed nominee’s qualifications as a director. Any such submission must be\naccompanied by the written consent of the proposed nominee to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nAs set forth in Power Integrations’ Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board’s leadership structure shall be either (a) a\nseparate Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, or (b) a Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer who is the\nsame person, together with a Lead Independent Director. The Nominating and Governance Committee determined that either of these\nstructures is appropriate for Power Integrations as each provides for an independent director to take the functional role where it is\nappropriate for an independent director to fulfill that function. Currently, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are\nthe same person and separate from the Lead Independent Director.\nAt this time, the Board believes that our CEO is best situated to serve as Chairman of the Board. Balu Balakrishnan is highly\nknowledgeable and has longstanding experience with respect to our business, operations and industry and ongoing executive\nresponsibility for the Company. As such, he is well positioned to identify strategic priorities and lead the Board’s consideration and\n13\nanalysis of such priorities. In addition, he offers a robust understanding of risks facing the Company. In the Board's view, this enables\nthe Board to better understand the Company and work with management to enhance stockholder value. In addition, the Board believes\nthat this structure enables it to better fulfill its risk oversight responsibilities and enhances the ability of the CEO to effectively\ncommunicate the Board's view to management.\nConcurrent with Mr. Balakrishnan’s appointment as Chairman of the Board in 2023, the Board appointed Mr. Balakrishan S.\nIyer as the lead independent director to help reinforce the independence of the Board as a whole. The position of lead independent\ndirector has been structured to serve as an effective balance to a combined CEO/Chairman of the Board. The lead independent director\nis empowered to, among other duties and responsibilities, preside over Board meetings, act as liaison between the Chairman of the Board\nand the independent directors, preside over meetings of the independent directors, and consult with the Chairman of the Board in\nplanning and setting schedules and agendas for Board meetings. As a result, we believe that the lead independent director can help\nensure the effective independent functioning of the Board in its oversight responsibilities. In addition, we believe that the lead\nindependent director is better positioned to build a consensus among directors and to serve as a conduit between the other independent\ndirectors and the Chairman of the Board, for example, by facilitating the inclusion on meeting agendas of matters of concern to the\nindependent directors. In light of Mr. Iyer’s extensive history with and knowledge of the Company, and because the Board’s lead\nindependent director is empowered to play a significant role in the Board’s leadership and in reinforcing the independence of the Board,\nwe believe that the Company has a balanced and effective Board governance structure.\nRole of the Board in Risk Oversight\nThe Board has an active role, as a whole and at the committee level, in overseeing management of the company’s risks. The\nBoard regularly reviews information regarding the Company’s credit, liquidity, operations, information technology (“IT”) and\ncybersecurity practices as well as the risks associated with each. The Audit Committee charter specifies that the committee shall review\nand discuss with management, and the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm as appropriate, the Company’s major\nfinancial risk exposures and the steps taken by management to monitor and control these exposures. The Compensation Committee is\nresponsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to the Company’s executive compensation plans and arrangements. The\nNominating and Governance Committee manages risks associated with the independence of the Board and potential conflicts of interest.\nWhile each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the Board is regularly\ninformed through committee reports about such risks. The full Board actively oversees the Company’s IT and cybersecurity policies,\nprocedures and risk assessments, and management reports to the Board on information security matters on a quarterly basis, or more\nfrequently as needed. We partner with third parties to help support our cybersecurity systems and maintain an awareness of current best\npractices, and we deliver quarterly cybersecurity awareness training to all employees.\nCompensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management\nWith the help of the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consulting firm, Aon, the Compensation\nCommittee has reviewed the Company’s compensation policies and practices as they relate to risk management for all employees,\nincluding executive officers. The compensation policies and practices reviewed by the Compensation Committee included: (1) annual\nbase salaries; (2) the annual and long-term performance-based incentive award plans; (3) equity incentive awards under the 2016\nIncentive Award Plan; (4) the Employee Stock Purchase Plan; and (5) the Executive Officer Benefits Agreements. Following such\nreview, the Compensation Committee determined that risks arising from the Company’s compensation policies and practices for its\nemployees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In coming to this conclusion, the Compensation\nCommittee also considered the mitigating effects of the Company’s compensation “claw-back” policy which requires the “claw-back”\nof incentive compensation paid to current and former executive officers when that compensation is based upon achievement of financial\nresults that later require a financial accounting restatement.\nMeetings of the Board\nThe Board met six times in 2023. All directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of the meetings of the Board and\nthe committees on which they served, held during the portion of the last fiscal year for which they were directors or committee members\nin 2023.\nAs required under applicable Nasdaq listing standards, in fiscal year 2023, Power Integrations’ independent directors met in\nregularly scheduled executive sessions at which only independent directors were present.\nStockholder Communications with the Board\nThe Board has adopted a formal process by which stockholders may communicate with the Board or any of its directors.\nStockholders who wish to communicate with the Board may do so by sending written communications addressed as follows: Power\nIntegrations Board Communication, 5245 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, California 95138-1002. Any communication sent must state the\nnumber of shares owned by the stockholder making the communication. The communications will be reviewed by the Chairman of the\n14\nBoard. The Chairman of the Board will forward such communication to the Board or to any individual director to whom the\ncommunication is addressed unless the communication is unduly frivolous, hostile, threatening or similarly inappropriate, in which case,\nthe Chairman of the Board shall discard the communication.\nSustainability, Corporate Responsibility and Business Ethics\nThe average home contains dozens of devices that spend the vast majority of their time in standby or no-load conditions. Due\nmainly to inefficient power supplies, the energy wasted by these devices adds up to a massive burden on our economy and our\nenvironment. A 2015 study1 found that in an average U.S. home, products in standby or other idle conditions consumed approximately\n$165 worth of electricity per year. Nationwide, this added up to an amount of power equivalent to the production of 50 large power\nplants. Our EcoSmart technology drastically reduces the amount of power wasted by electronic products when they are plugged in but\nnot in use. We estimate that in 2023 this technology saved approximately 15 terawatt-hours of electricity, an amount equal to the entire\nannual consumption of about two million homes.2 In addition to these standby savings, the highly efficient silicon and gallium-nitride\ntransistors incorporated in our integrated circuits also enable highly efficient “active-mode” operation of electronic products. We believe\nour BridgeSwitch™ motor-driver products offer the highest efficiency available for powering brushless direct current (“DC”) motors\nused in many home-appliance applications, while our SCALE gate-drivers are used in a variety of clean technologies such as solar and\nwind energy systems, high-voltage DC transmission lines and electric transportation.\nAs a producer of technologies and products that generate significant environmental benefits, we understand that there is\neconomic opportunity in operating with the good of society and the environment in mind. We take a long-term approach to planning\nand decision making, and invest for sustainable growth and profitability. We foster stable, long-term relationships with manufacturing\npartners holding ISO quality and environmental certifications. We value our employees, giving them the tools and training to grow as\nindividuals, and the freedom to take risks in the service of innovation. Despite a challenging fiscal year 2023, requiring that we prudently\nmanage expenses, we gave normal annual salary increases and continued to hire, contributing to a below average employee turnover\nrelative to our industry. As a result of our long-term, sustainable approach, we have a track record of positive earnings, high levels of\ncustomer satisfaction and below-average employee turnover relative to our industry.\nAs a fabless semiconductor company, we regard our manufacturing partners as an extension of our operations. We have a\nrigorous qualification process and choose only established wafer foundries and assembly-and-test sub-contractors who are ISO 14001\ncertified for environmental compliance and IATF 16949 certified for quality management. All of our foundry partners have roadmaps\nto deliver substantial reductions in GHG/CO2 emissions. We expect our manufacturing partners to subscribe to our Supplier Code of\nConduct and regularly audit our suppliers to ensure compliance. As a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative, we are committed\nto ensuring that all of our products containing cobalt, tungsten, gold, tantalum and tin are conflict-free or sourced from compliant\nsmelters and refiners.\nWe operate a 600-kilowatt solar array at our San Jose headquarters, which generates enough power to effectively take one of\nour three buildings off the grid and to power our parking lot lights. Among the ten largest commercial solar installations in Silicon\nValley at the time of its completion, the system is expected to prevent more than 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions over 25 years. In 2023,\nwe undertook an expansion of the solar array at our headquarters which when completed, will add more than a megawatt of additional\ngenerating capacity along with nearly a hundred new electric-vehicle charging stations. In 2022, we opened a new facility in Biel,\nSwitzerland featuring a 25-kilowatt solar array. In 2021, we installed 43 kilowatts of solar capacity at our facility in Ense, Germany.\nWe have a skilled and diverse workforce, and we offer competitive compensation including generous benefits, paying an above-\naverage percentage of the cost of employees’ health, dental and vision insurance. We offer flexible spending accounts for healthcare\nand child-care expenses, matching 401(k) contributions, an employee stock purchase plan, paid vacation and family leave, life and\ndisability insurance, flu vaccinations, tuition reimbursement, health-and-wellness programs designed to promote physical well-being\nand other mental health services. We encourage employee skill growth by offering tuition reimbursement of up to $5,250 each year for\njob related education. We offer workshops on a range of personal development topics such as financial planning, nutrition and stress\nmanagement. We also support employees’ charitable giving by matching up to $750 of donations per employee per year.\nAdditional information, including workforce diversity and injury data, quantitative reporting on energy usage and the energy\nsavings enabled by our products, and the reports and policies listed below, can be found at the “Sustainability and Citizenship” section\nof our corporate website, www.power.com/company/sustainability-and-citizenship:\n• Supplier Code of Conduct\n• Human Rights Policy\n• Conflict Minerals Report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n1 National Resources Defense Council, May 2015 (https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/home-idle-load-IP.pdf)\n2 U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator\n15\n• Conflict Minerals Policy Statement\n• UK Modern Slavery Act Statement\n• Environment, Health and Safety Policy\n• RoHS/REACH Compliant and Halogen Free Statement\n• Certification of REACH SVHC Non-Usage\n• Environmental, Health and Safety Policy\n• Injury and Illness Prevention Program\n• Whistleblower Policy\n• Non-discrimination Policy\nPower Integrations has adopted the Power Integrations, Inc. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all officers,\ndirectors and employees. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be found on our website, www.power.com, and is available in\nprint to any stockholder who requests it. Requests for printed copies of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be made by writing\nto Attn: Investor Relations Department, Power Integrations, Inc., 5245 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, California 95138-1002. We intend to\nsatisfy the disclosure requirements of Form 8-K regarding an amendment to, or a waiver from, a provision of our Code of Business\nConduct and Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller,\nor persons performing similar functions by posting such information on our website listed above.\nBoard Stock Ownership Guidelines\nPursuant to Power Integrations’ Corporate Governance Guidelines and to align the interests of the Company’s directors with\nthe interests of the Company’s stockholders, the Board believes that directors should have a significant financial stake in the Company.\nAccordingly, the Board believes that each director who has served on the Board for three years (excluding service prior to the date of\nadoption of the board stock ownership guidelines) should own an aggregate number of shares of our common stock that shall have a\nvalue equal to or exceeding three times the annual cash retainer payable by the Company for such director’s service on the Board. At its\ndiscretion, the Board may evaluate whether this requirement should be waived in the case of any director, who, because of his or her\npersonal circumstances, would incur a hardship by complying with this requirement. Currently all members of the Board comply with\nthe guidelines.\nChief Executive Officer Stock-Ownership Guidelines\nPursuant to Power Integrations’ Corporate Governance Guidelines and to align the interests of our chief executive officer with\nthe interests of the Company’s stockholders, the Board believes that the chief executive officer should have a significant financial stake\nin the Company. Accordingly, the Board believes that our chief executive officer, upon reaching three years of service in this role\n(excluding service prior to the date of the chief executive officer stock ownership guidelines) should own an aggregate number of shares\nof our common stock with a value equal to or exceeding three times the chief executive officer’s annual base salary. At its discretion,\nthe Board may evaluate whether this requirement should be waived in the case of the chief executive officer, who, because of his or her\npersonal circumstances, would incur a hardship by complying with this requirement, including as a result of a decrease in the value of\nour common stock.\nAs of March 22, 2024, Mr. Balakrishnan owned outright 419,360 shares of our common stock (including shares owned through\nhis personal trust), with a value of approximately $29.4 million.\nExecutive Officer Stock Ownership\nAlthough we do not have minimum mandatory stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers other than our chief\nexecutive officer, the structure of our compensation programs acts as a functional equivalent of minimum stock ownership requirements,\nas our executive officers: (1) hold unvested RSUs, which entitle the executive officers to receive shares of our common stock in the\nfuture upon vesting (unvested RSUs as of March 22, 2024, for the Company’s named executive officers were as follows: 92,300 shares\nfor Mr. Balakrishnan; 36,375 shares for Mr. Nayyar; 26,975 shares for Mr. Barsan; 21,629 shares for Mr. Gupta; and 19,499 shares for\nMr. Yee); and (2) hold unvested PSUs and PRSUs, which entitle the executive officer to receive shares of our common stock in the\nfuture upon vesting which occurs upon achieving established performance metrics (currently collectively 148,800 shares for\nMr. Balakrishnan; 26,000 shares for Mr. Nayyar; 18,400 shares for Mr. Barsan; 15,000 shares for Mr. Gupta; and 12,200 shares for Mr.\nYee).\nMinimum Vesting Periods for Executive Officer Equity Grants\nAlthough we do not have minimum mandatory vesting periods for equity grants made to our executive officers, our historical\npractice, which our Compensation Committee intends to continue in the future, is to have vesting periods on our equity grants typically\nas follows: (1) for RSUs, vesting over four years with 25% of the shares subject to the RSU vesting on each of the first four anniversaries\n16\nof the date of grant; (2) for PSUs, vesting after one year, but only to the extent that the performance metrics for the PSUs are met; and\n(3) for PRSUs vesting after three years, but only to the extent that the performance metrics for the PRSUs are met.\nMinimum Vesting Periods for Director Equity Grants\nNon-employee directors each receive an annual equity compensation grant, which consists of RSUs that vest in full effective\nimmediately prior to the commencement of the Company’s first annual meeting of stockholders in the year following the year of the\nannual grant, provided that the recipient is still providing services to the Company as a director. A new eligible director generally\nreceives a similar grant pro-rated to the remaining portion of the year prior to the next annual grants of equity awards to non-employee\ndirectors.\nProhibition on Hedging\nOur Board has adopted a policy that prohibits directors, executive officers and other insiders (as defined in such policy) from\nengaging in short sales, transactions in put or call options, hedging transactions or other inherently speculative transactions with respect\nto our common stock at any time.\n17\nPROPOSAL 2\nADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) and Section 14A of the Exchange\nAct, Power Integrations’ stockholders are entitled to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s named\nexecutive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules. This vote is not intended to address any specific\nitem of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the Company’s named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and\npractices described in this proxy statement.\nThe compensation of the Company’s named executive officers subject to the vote is disclosed in the Compensation Discussion\nand Analysis, the compensation tables, and the related narrative disclosure contained in this proxy statement. As discussed in those\ndisclosures, the company believes that its compensation policies and decisions are focused on pay-for-performance principles, strongly\naligned with our stockholders’ interests and consistent with current market practices. Compensation of the Company’s named executive\nofficers is designed to enable the Company to attract and retain talented and experienced executives to lead the company successfully\nin a competitive environment.\nOur executive compensation program has been designed to retain and encourage a talented, motivated and focused executive\nteam by providing competitive compensation within our market. We believe that our executive compensation program provides an\nappropriate balance between salary and “at-risk” forms of variable incentive compensation, as well as a mix of incentives that encourage\nexecutive focus on both short- and long-term goals as a company without encouraging inappropriate risks to achieve performance.\nHighlights of our program include:\n• A mixture of salary and variable incentive compensation that provides for a substantial portion of executive\ncompensation to be “at-risk” and dependent on our performance as a company which aligns the interests of executive\nofficers with those of the company’s stockholders;\n• Long-term, equity-based incentive compensation to align the interests of executive officers with stockholders and to\nprovide each executive officer with an incentive to manage the company from the perspective of an owner with an\nequity stake in the business; and\n• A compensation “claw-back” policy which conditions the earning and payment of any cash or stock bonuses to\nexecutive officers on an agreement to repay a portion of such bonuses in the event of a financial accounting\nrestatement.\nAccordingly, the Board is asking the stockholders to indicate their support for the compensation of the Company’s named\nexecutive officers as described in this proxy statement by casting a non-binding advisory vote “FOR” the following resolution:\n“RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Power Integrations’ named executive officers, as disclosed in the proxy\nstatement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and\nnarrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”\nBecause the vote is advisory, it is not binding on the Board or the Company. Nevertheless, the views expressed by the\nstockholders, whether through this vote or otherwise, are important to management and the Board and, accordingly, the Board and the\nCompensation Committee intend to consider the results of this vote in making determinations regarding executive compensation\narrangements in the future.\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS\nA VOTE IN FAVOR OF PROPOSAL 2\n18\nPROPOSAL 3\nRATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Audit Committee has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP as Power Integrations’ independent registered public accounting\nfirm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The Board has directed that management submit the selection of Deloitte & Touche\nLLP as Power Integrations’ independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting. In\ndetermining whether to reappoint the independent auditor, the Audit Committee takes into consideration various factors, including the\nauditor’s historical and recent performance on the audit; the length of time the firm has served in this role; professional qualifications;\nthe quality of ongoing discussions with the auditor; external data, including recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board reports\non the auditor and its peer firms; and the appropriateness of fees.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP has audited Power Integrations’ financial statements since 2005. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche\nLLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be\navailable to respond to appropriate questions.\nNeither Power Integrations’ Bylaws nor other governing documents or law requires stockholder ratification of the selection of\nDeloitte & Touche LLP as Power Integrations’ independent registered public accounting firm. However, the Board is submitting the\nselection of Deloitte & Touche LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to\nratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit\nCommittee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during\nthe year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Power Integrations and its stockholders.\nPrincipal Accountant Fees and Services\nThe following table represents aggregate fees billed to Power Integrations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 by Deloitte & Touche LLP, Power Integrations’ independent registered public accounting firm.\nFiscal Fiscal\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nAudit Fees(1) ....................................................................... $ 1,515 $ 1,485\nAudit-Related Fees .................................................................. — —\nTax Fees(2) ......................................................................... 164 170\nAll Other Fees ...................................................................... — —\nTotal Fees ......................................................................... $ 1,679 $ 1,655\n(1) Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our consolidated annual financial statements\nand review of the interim consolidated financial statements included in quarterly reports and services that are normally provided\nby Deloitte & Touche LLP in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. Audit fees for 2023 and 2022\ninclude fees for professional services rendered for the audits of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\n(2) In 2023 and 2022, tax fees related primarily to tax planning and tax compliance advice.\nAll fees described above were approved by the Audit Committee.\nPre-Approval Policy and Procedures\nThe Audit Committee has a policy to approve in advance the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm\nfor all audit services and non-audit services, based on independence, qualifications and, if applicable, performance, and approve the fees\nand other terms of any such engagement; provided, however, that the Audit Committee may establish pre-approval policies and\nprocedures for any engagement to render such services, provided that such policies and procedures (a) are detailed as to particular\nservices, (b) do not involve delegation to management of the Audit Committee’s responsibilities, and (c) provide that, at its next\nscheduled meeting, the Audit Committee is informed as to each such service for which the independent auditor is engaged pursuant to\nsuch policies and procedures. In addition, the Audit Committee may delegate to one or more members of the committee the authority to\ngrant pre-approvals for such audit and non-audit services, provided that (1) the decisions of such member(s) to grant any such pre-\napproval shall be presented to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting and (2) the Audit Committee has established policies\nand procedures for such pre-approval of services consistent with the requirements of clauses (a) and (b) above.\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS\nA VOTE IN FAVOR OF PROPOSAL 3\n19\nPROPOSAL 4\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE\nJohn Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, who holds 50 shares of our common stock,\nwhich he has held for more than three years, intends to submit the proposal as set forth below for consideration at the Annual Meeting. The\nCompany is not responsible for the contents of the proposal. If properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the Board is not making any\nrecommendation regarding this proposal.\nProposal 4 – Simple Majority Vote\nShareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws (that is explicit\nor implicit due to default to state law) that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be replaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes\ncast for and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority in compliance with applicable laws. If necessary this means the closest standard\nto a majority of the votes cast for and against such proposals consistent with the applicable laws. This includes making the necessary changes\nin plain English.\nShareholders are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance. Supermajority voting\nrequirements have been found to be one of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to “What\nMatters in Corporate Governance” by Lucien Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School. Supermajority requirements\nare used to block initiatives supported by most shareowners but opposed by a status quo management.\nThis proposal topic won from 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs, FirstEnergy,\nMcGraw-Hill and Macy’s. These votes would have been higher than 74% to 88% if more shareholders had access to independent proxy voting\nadvice. This proposal topic also received overwhelming 98%-support each at the 2023 annual meetings of American Airlines (AAL) and The\nCarlyle Group (CG).\nThe overwhelming shareholder support for this proposal topic at hundreds of major companies raises the question of why Power\nIntegrations had not initiated this proposal topic earlier.\nPlease vote yes:\nSimple Majority Vote – Proposal 4\nBoard of Directors’ Response\nThe Board has considered the proposal set forth above relating to the removal of supermajority voting standards in our restated\ncertificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and has determined to make no voting recommendation to our stockholders.\nThe proposal is advisory in nature only. Stockholders should note that approval of this proposal would not, by itself, implement a\nmajority voting standard as described in the proposal, and the Board and our stockholders would need to take subsequent action to\namend our restated certificate of incorporation and/or our amended and restated bylaws.\nThe proposal asks that we amend any provisions in our charter and bylaws which require more than a simple majority vote to\ninstead require only a simple majority vote. The default voting standard for stockholder action under our governing documents is a\nmajority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote. However, as permitted by Delaware law, our governing documents\nspecify supermajority voting standards applicable only to certain extraordinary transactions and fundamental changes in corporate\ngovernance. For example, the only supermajority provisions included in our governing documents are:\n• Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Article Seventh. Requiring the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting\npower of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company to amend the amended and restated bylaws when\npresented for stockholder approval.\n20\n• Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Article Ninth. Requiring the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting\npower of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company to amend the following provisions of the restated\ncertificate of incorporation:\no Article Fifth.\n change the method by which any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders must be effected,\nincluding the method by which directors shall be elected and hold office until the next Annual Meeting\n(Article Fifth, Sections A-C);\n change the method by which special meetings of stockholders of the Company may be called (Article Fifth,\nSection D);\no Article Sixth.\n change the number of directors that constitute the Board (Article Sixth, section A);\n change the method by which vacancies resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal, or other\ncause can be filled on the Board (Article Sixth, Sections B and C);\no Article Seventh.\n amend the provision which provides for the method for the Board and stockholders to amend the amended\nand restated bylaws;\no Article Eighth.\n amend the provision that provides when a director shall be personally liable to the Company or its\nstockholders for breaches of fiduciary duty;\no Article Ninth. Amend the provision which provides for the method to amend the restated certificate of incorporation;\nand\n• Amended and Restated Bylaws, Article IX. Requiring the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the\noutstanding shares of capital stock of the Company to amend the amended and restated bylaws when presented for stockholder\napproval.\nThe Board adopted these limited supermajority voting requirements to ensure that there is broad support for any extraordinary\ntransactions or fundamental changes to corporate governance affecting all stockholders. Under the proposed voting standard, only a\nmajority of the votes actually cast for or against a proposal at any annual or special meeting is required; consequently, a few large\nstockholders could approve certain key actions and significantly alter our governance structure. For example, in the event of a meeting\nin which only 50% plus one share of our outstanding shares of capital stock were present and entitled to vote a stockholder meeting (the\nminimum number to constitute a quorum), holders of 25% plus one share of our outstanding capital stock could approve changes to our\ncorporate governance structure. Such a circumstance would be avoided by maintaining the current, limited supermajority voting\nstandards.\nThe Board further notes that as of March 22, 2024, the shareholder proponent of this proposal owned approximately 50 shares\nof the Company’s common stock out of more than 56.9 million shares outstanding. Nevertheless, the Board is interested in the viewpoints\nof the Company’s stockholders and will evaluate the voting results on Proposal No. 4, together with additional stockholder input received\nin the course of the Company’s regular stockholder engagement program, in determining what actions it will take.\nAccordingly, the Board has elected not to make a recommendation with respect to this proposal.\nTHE BOARD IS NOT MAKING ANY RECOMMENDATION REGARDING PROPOSAL 4\n21\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD*\nDuring 2023, four independent, non-employee directors served on the Audit Committee: Mr. Iyer, Mrs. Ganti, Dr. Sayiner and\nMr. Vig. Dr. Sayiner retired from service on the company’s Board of directors on May 19, 2023. Following Dr. Sayiner’s retirement,\nthree directors composed the Audit Committee: Mr. Iyer, Mrs. Ganti and Mr. Vig. The Committee operates under a written charter\nadopted by the Board, which can be found on our website at www.power.com.\nThe Audit Committee, the Company’s management and the independent registered public accounting firm (Deloitte & Touche\nLLP) have specific but different responsibilities relating to Power Integrations’ financial reporting. Management is responsible for Power\nIntegrations’ internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for\nauditing the Company’s financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls. The Audit Committee’s\nresponsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.\nThe Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of any independent\nauditor (including resolution of disagreements between management and the auditor regarding financial reporting) engaged by the\ncompany for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work. The Audit Committee consults with the independent\nauditor to assure partner rotation at least every five years, as required by applicable rules, and in order to assure continuing auditor\nindependence. The Audit Committee annually evaluates the qualifications, performance and independence of the auditor. The evaluation\nincludes reviewing the auditor’s quality-control procedures and a review of the lead audit partner, taking into consideration the opinions\nof management and the Company’s internal auditors. The results of the evaluation are reported to the Board together with any\nrecommendations for necessary actions.\nThe Audit Committee meets with the auditor periodically throughout the year to discuss the planning and staffing of the annual\naudit. The Audit Committee also meets with both management and the auditor to discuss the results of the annual audit, including the\nauditor’s assessment of the quality, not just acceptability, of accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and\nestimates, the adequacy of the financial statement disclosures and any other matters required to be communicated to the Committee\nunder the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”).\nIn this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023, with management and Deloitte & Touche LLP. The Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte & Touche\nLLP the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB. The Audit Committee has also received the\nwritten disclosures and the letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the\nindependent accountants’ communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent\nregistered public accounting firm the accounting firm’s independence.\nBased on its discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee has\nrecommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Power Integrations’ Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE\nBalakrishnan S.

The maximum number of shares subject to purchase rights under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is a\nfunction of stock price and total employee contributions. As such we cannot reasonably determine the number of shares subject\nto outstanding purchase rights as of December 31, 2023.\n(3) On July 28, 2009, this plan was amended to generally prohibit outstanding options or stock appreciation rights from being\ncanceled in exchange for cash without stockholder approval and already prohibited the repricing of any outstanding stock\nawards and the canceling and re-granting of any outstanding stock awards without stockholder approval.\n25\nDELINQUENT SECTION 16(a) REPORTS\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10%\nof our common stock to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. These persons are required\nby SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file.\nTo our knowledge, based solely on our review of electronic filings with the SEC of such reports and written representations\nfrom our executive officers and directors that no other reports were required during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we believe\nthat all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to the executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than\n10% of our common stock were complied with in 2023.\n26\nCOMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS\nCash Compensation. Pursuant to our cash compensation policy, each of our directors, with the exception of Mr. Balakrishnan,\nreceives $11,250 per quarter to serve as a member of the Board, and the chairman of the Board, or Lead Independent Director when the\nchairman of the Board is an employee of our company, receives an additional $7,500 per quarter to serve in such capacity. Our non-\nemployee directors do not receive per-meeting fees.\nIn addition, the chairs of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee, receive\n$5,000, $3,750 and $2,500 per quarter, respectively. Non-chair members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and\nNominating and Governance Committee receive $2,500, $2,000 and $1,250 per quarter, respectively, to serve on these committees.\nNon-employee directors are reimbursed for all reasonable travel and related expenses incurred in connection with attending\nBoard and committee meetings.\nEquity Awards. Additionally, directors who are not employees of Power Integrations each receive equity compensation.\nInitial and annual equity incentive grants are made to non-employee directors primarily under the Power Integrations 2016\nIncentive Award Plan (the “2016 Plan”) as follows (the “Directors Equity Compensation Program”):\n• On the first trading day of July in each year (the “Regular Grant Date”), each continuing eligible director will receive\na grant of an equity award in the form RSUs under the 2016 Plan with an aggregate value of $120,000 (the “Equity\nAward”). Each such Equity Award would vest in full effective immediately prior to the commencement of the\nCompany’s first annual meeting of stockholders in the year following the year of the Regular Grant Date, provided\nthat the recipient is still providing services to the Company as a director and provided further, that 100% of the shares\nsubject to such Equity Award would be deemed fully vested upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control,” as such\nterm is defined in the 2016 Plan;\n• A new eligible director generally would receive an Equity Award consisting of RSUs equal to the prorated portion of\nthe Company’s annual Equity Awards based on the time between the date the new director is appointed to the Board\nand the first trading day of Nasdaq in the month of July following such director’s appointment; and\n• The Directors Equity Compensation Program will remain in effect at the discretion of the Board or the Compensation\nCommittee.\nMr. Balakrishnan, our chief executive officer and president, was not compensated for his services as Chairman and member of\nthe Board.\nThe following table shows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 certain information with respect to the compensation\nof all non-employee directors of Power Integrations:\nDirector Compensation for Fiscal Year 2023\nFees Earned or R estricted Stock\nName Paid in Cash(1) Unit Awards(2)(3) Total\nWendy Arienzo ....................................................... $ 65,000 $ 118,992 $ 183,992\nNicholas E.

The grant date fair value was\ncalculated by multiplying the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date by the number of shares underlying\nthe award, reduced by the discounted present value of dividends expected to be declared before the awards vest.\n(3) As of December 31, 2023, each non-employee director held 1,265 unvested restricted stock units.\nOn January 3, 2023, Ms. Gioia received an initial equity grant with an aggregate value of approximately $60,000 which fully\nvested on May 19, 2023. On April 3, 2023, Mr. Vig received an initial equity grant with an aggregate value of approximately $30,000\nwhich fully vested on May 19, 2023. An equity award with an aggregate value of approximately $120,000 was granted to each non-\nemployee director on July 3, 2023. No other equity awards were granted to non-employee directors in fiscal year 2023. The RSU grants\nwill vest immediately prior to the Annual Meeting, subject to the non-employee director’s continued service to the date of the Annual\nMeeting. The number of RSUs issued under such equity award was calculated as $120,000 divided by the per share fair market value\nof our common stock on the date of grant.\n28\nCOMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nThe primary objectives of the Compensation Committee with respect to executive compensation are as follows:\n1. To establish compensation levels that enable us to attract and retain qualified executive management;\n2. To fairly compensate executives for the value of work provided;\n3. To compensate executives for achieving specific company goals and objectives;\n4. To align the incentives of our executives with the interests of our stockholders by providing equity awards to executives\nso that each executive has a meaningful ownership interest in our company; and\n5. To implement executive compensation programs in an objective and non-discriminatory manner.\nTo achieve these objectives, the Compensation Committee implements and maintains compensation plans that tie a substantial\nportion of the executives’ overall compensation to our company’s financial performance and the price of our common stock. Overall,\nan executive’s total compensation is intended to create an executive compensation program that is set at levels competitive with the\nexecutive compensation paid by other comparable public technology companies.\nThe Compensation Committee believed the metrics of the 2023 executive compensation plan (the “2023 Plan”) were directly\ntied to our core operating performance, were key factors in driving stockholder value, and were important business elements that Power\nIntegrations’ executives could meaningfully influence. By focusing on these metrics, the Compensation Committee sought to align the\nfinancial interests of our executives with those of our stockholders.\nRole of Our Chief Executive Officer in Determining Compensation. Mr. Balakrishnan, Power Integrations’ president and\nchief executive officer, reviews with the Compensation Committee on a regular basis our compensation philosophy and programs,\nincluding with respect to the named executive officers (the executive officers appearing in our summary compensation table in this\nproxy), so that the Compensation Committee can make any changes necessary to keep the company’s compensation philosophy and\nprograms aligned with the company’s business objectives. Mr. Balakrishnan makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee\nwith respect to the compensation of the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee also utilizes an outside compensation\nconsultant to stay abreast of developments in the competitive landscape for executive compensation. The Compensation Committee\nconsiders, but is not bound to and does not always accept, management’s and the outside consultant’s recommendations with respect to\nexecutive compensation. The Compensation Committee discusses Mr. Balakrishnan’s compensation with him, but deliberates and\nmakes decisions with respect to Mr. Balakrishnan’s compensation without him present.\nMr. Balakrishnan attends some of the Compensation Committee meetings, but leaves the meetings as appropriate when matters\nof executive compensation specific to him are discussed or voted upon.\nComparative Compensation Analysis and Role of Compensation Consultant. Power Integrations generally aligns both its\ncash and equity compensation to market comparables. In 2023, the Compensation Committee engaged an independent compensation\nconsulting firm, Radford, part of the Rewards and Solutions practice at Aon plc (“Aon”), to assist in the analysis of compensation survey\ndata. Aon attends Compensation Committee meetings from time to time and provides peer-group analysis, feedback and\nrecommendations to the Compensation Committee. In addition to survey data, the Compensation Committee considers from time to\ntime information reported in peer companies’ SEC filings for all elements of compensation, including salary, annual cash and equity\nincentive or bonus compensation, and equity compensation.\n29\nIn 2023, Aon performed a review of the performance metrics (revenue, non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals) used\nin connection with the establishment of the 2023 Plan, including the number of PSUs granted to each of the named executive officers,\nand the revenue target used in connection with the company’s grant of PRSUs.\nThe Compensation Committee utilized Aon’s compensation survey performed in October 2022 to complete the 2023\ncompensation review. The 2022 peer analysis considered peer companies to be U.S. based semiconductor companies with similar global\nscope and complexity, and businesses falling into specific categories of semiconductors and related services, such as integrated circuits,\nsemiconductor solutions and computer communications and with revenues between 50% to 250% Power Integrations’ revenues and\nmarket capitalizations of 33% to 300% of Power Integrations’ market capitalization. The peer group that resulted from this screening\nmethod consisted of 17 companies and was large and diverse enough that the addition or elimination of any two companies did not alter\nthe overall analysis materially.\nThe full list of seventeen companies was as follows:\nCompany Name Company Name\nAdvanced Energy Industries, Inc. Maxlinear, Inc.\nAllegro MicroSystems, Inc. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.\nAmbarella, Inc. Rambus, Inc.\nAxcelis Technologies, Inc. Semtech Corporation\nCirrus Logic, Inc. Silicon Labs, Inc.\nDiodes, Inc. Synaptics Incorporated\nKnowles Corporation Universal Display Corporation\nLattice Semiconductor Corporation Wolfspeed, Inc.\nMACOM Technology Solutions, Inc.\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee continued to utilize the 50th percentile as a general reference point, but not a specific\ntarget, for the aggregate value of base salary and target performance-based equity incentive compensation for the named executive\nofficers, and the 75th percentile as a general reference point, but not a specific target, for long-term equity incentive compensation. The\nCompensation Committee continued to utilize a higher general reference point for long-term equity incentive compensation than the\nother components of executive compensation to provide a stronger incentive to the executive officers to manage the company as owners\nwith equity stakes in the business.\nIn 2023, based on the 2022 Aon survey data and other relevant factors, the Compensation Committee determined it was\nappropriate that Mr. Balakrishnan’s and the named executive officers’ equity compensation and equity grants for 2023 be the same\ncombination of RSUs, PSUs and PRSUs as was granted in 2022. The PRSU grants are intended to promote and retain stability within\nthe executive team by setting multi-year performance targets.\nThe Compensation Committee is not bound by award formulas and is free to exercise its discretion to adjust salaries, bonus\nawards and equity awards. Generally, in arriving at compensation levels the Compensation Committee also considers the pay history of\neach executive, the relative pay among executives, the performance of the company and the performance and experience of each\nexecutive.\nThe Role of Stockholder Say-on-Pay Votes. Each year since 2011, we have provided our stockholders with the opportunity to\ncast an advisory vote on executive compensation, and at each of these annual meetings of stockholders our stockholders approved the\ndisclosure of the executive compensation plans. In 2023, more than 95% of the shares present and entitled to vote at the annual meetings\nof stockholders were cast in favor of the disclosure of the compensation of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee\nviewed this approval as a strong endorsement of our compensation policies and practices and continued to conduct itself in a manner\nconsistent with past practice in establishing the following year’s base salaries and equity compensation. Although the stockholder vote\nis non-binding, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of future votes, including the vote which will take place at the\nAnnual Meeting, when making future compensation decisions for named executive officers.\nExecutive Compensation Components\nThe 2023 Plan comprised the following components:\na) base salary,\nb) performance-based equity incentive awards (“PSUs”),\nc) long-term performance-based equity incentive awards (“PRSUs”) and\nd) long-term time-based equity incentive awards (“RSUs”).\n30\nIn addition, the named executive officers are eligible to participate in our health and welfare programs, employee stock purchase\nplan (subject to limitations), 401(k) plan and other benefit programs generally available to employees of the company.\nBase Salary. We pay a base salary to each of our named executive officers to provide an appropriate and competitive base level\nof current cash income. The Compensation Committee generally reviews base salaries annually, and adjusts them from time to time to\nrealign salaries with perceived market levels after taking into account individual responsibilities, performance and experience. In 2023,\nthe Compensation Committee granted salary increases of approximately 2% for the Company’s chief executive officer and 5% for the\nother named executive officers. The adjusted salary levels were consistent with peer company salary levels for analogous positions.\nShort-term Performance-based Equity Incentive Awards. The Compensation Committee believes that a substantial portion of\nthe annual compensation for each executive officer should be in the form of variable (i.e., performance-based) equity incentive awards.\nThese awards are intended to compensate executive officers for achieving annual financial goals at the corporate level. The\nCompensation Committee utilizes these awards to attract and retain qualified executives, align their interests with those of the\nCompany’s stockholders, and provide appropriate executive and leadership incentives.\nIn 2023, as in prior years, the Compensation Committee granted performance-based equity incentive awards in the form of\nPSUs. The aggregate value of PSUs awarded on the grant date to all of the named executive officers was approximately 12% higher\nthan the PSUs awarded pursuant to the 2022 Plan. The PSUs are awarded at the beginning of the fiscal year in the amount of 200% of\nthe number of shares that will ultimately vest if the one-year target performance criteria are met but not exceeded. The PSUs vest\ndepending on the extent to which the Company meets or exceeds the minimum performance criteria discussed under “Mechanics of\n2023 Performance-based Equity Incentive Awards” below; the amount of shares vesting can range from zero to 100% of the shares\nawarded.\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee utilized an Aon survey and 2022 peer group analysis directly comparing the value of\nindividual 2022 target PSU awards with the short-term incentive compensation paid to executive officers in analogous positions at peer\ncompanies in verifying the Compensation Committee’s general reference point for the 2023 target value. The value of the PSU grants\nfor each officer at target was between the 25th and 50th percentiles of the value of cash targets for each position in the Aon survey.\nOverall, the value of 2023 PSU target compensation was approximately 139% of the annual base salary for the company’s chief\nexecutive officer and approximately 71% to 77% of annual base salary for the company’s other named executive officers.\nThese percentages are consistent with 2022 and positioned between the 25th and 50th percentiles for similar compensation at our peer\ncompanies.\nMechanics of 2023 Performance-based Equity Incentive Awards\nFor the 2023 Plan, the Compensation Committee determined that the number of shares subject to the PSUs that would ultimately\nvest, and therefore our officers would receive, would be determined based upon the company’s 2023 performance in three areas: net\nrevenue, non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals. The Compensation Committee’s intent in the design of the 2023 Plan was to\nemphasize revenue growth and to focus management on operating profitability by tying vesting to non-GAAP operating income (as\ndefined below) and create long-term value for our stockholders. The weighting of these components was as follows:\nThreshold(1) Target(2) Maximum(3)\nNet revenue ................................................................ 0 % 35% 70%\nNon-GAAP operating income ................................................. 0 % 35% 70%\nStrategic goals .............................................................. 0 % 30% 60%\nTotal ...................................................................... 0 % 100% 200%\n(1) No PSUs would vest for a specific performance goal if Power Integrations’ 2023 actual net revenue or revenue growth rate,\nactual non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals, as applicable, did not exceed at least an established minimum amount\nas set forth in the 2023 Plan.\n(2) Target represents the number of PSUs which would vest for a specific goal if Power Integrations’ 2023 actual net revenue or\nrevenue growth, actual non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals, as applicable, met but did not exceed the established\ntarget amount as set forth in the 2023 Plan.\n(3) Maximum represents the maximum awards which could vest for a specific goal if Power Integrations’ 2023 actual net revenue\nor revenue growth, actual non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals, as applicable, met or exceeded the established\nmaximum amounts as set forth in the 2023 Plan.\n“Non-GAAP operating income” means operating income for 2023 determined in accordance with the generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding the following items: (i) stock-based compensation expenses recorded\nunder Accounting Standard Codification 718-10; (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the fair-value write-up of\nacquired inventory, (iii) any other expenses related to mergers and acquisitions and (iv) any other adjustment made to arrive at the\n31\ncompany’s non-GAAP financial information as presented in our SEC filings. The Compensation Committee excluded these items\nbecause the Compensation Committee reasoned that these items were not indicative of operating performance and did not relate to\nachieving Power Integrations’ compensation objectives.\nRevenue Component:\nThe Company regards revenue growth as a key measure of its success and maintains a goal of growing revenues at a rate\nexceeding that of the analog semiconductor industry as reported by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”). The Compensation\nCommittee set the below revenue thresholds based on the prevailing macroeconomic and industry conditions, intending that the difficulty\nof attaining the thresholds would be consistent with that of prior years, i.e., that the target and maximum levels under the 2023 Plan\nrepresented challenging, aggressive goals.\nThe PSUs vesting under the revenue component shall be calculated based on an Absolute Measure and Relative Measure, each\nas described below, with the higher of the two calculations resulting in the actual shares vested.\nAbsolute Measure: The PSUs would not vest for the named executive officers with respect to the revenue component of the\n2023 Plan if 2023 revenues failed to exceed $540 million. To the extent 2023 actual revenues exceeded $540 million, the number of\nshares subject to the PSUs vesting would have increased linearly from zero at $540 million, up to 100% of the target amount at $590\nmillion, and linearly from that level up to a maximum of 200% of the target amount at $620 million.\nRelative Measure: The PSUs would not vest for the named executive officers with respect to the revenue component of the\n2023 Plan if the Company’s revenue annual growth rate (“AGR”) for the year ended December 31, 2023, failed to exceed a minimum\nthreshold set at four percentage points lower than the revenue AGR of the analog semiconductor industry (the “Index”), derived using\nhistorical and forecasted revenue data reported by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”). To the extent the Company’s\nrevenue AGR exceeded the minimum threshold of four percentage points below the Index, the number of PSU shares vesting would\nhave increased linearly from zero at the minimum threshold, up to 100% of the target amount when the Company’s revenue AGR was\nequal to the Index, and linearly from that level up to a maximum of 200% of the target amount when the Company’s revenue AGR was\nequal to or greater than four percentage points higher than the Index. In the event that the Company’s revenue AGR is zero or negative,\nvesting is limited to no more than 100% of the target amount. In January 2024, under the revenue component, based on the $444.5\nmillion of net revenue achieved in 2023, the Compensation Committee determined that none of the total target PSUs awarded would\nvest in 2024.\nNon-GAAP Operating Income Component:\nThe PSUs would not vest for the named executive officers with respect to the non-GAAP operating income component of the\n2023 Plan if 2023 non-GAAP operating income failed to exceed $129.1 million. To the extent actual non-GAAP operating income\nexceeded $129.1 million, the number of shares subject to the PSUs vesting would have increased linearly from zero at $129.1 million\nof non-GAAP operating income up to 100% of the target amount at $152.3 million, and linearly from that level up to a maximum of\n200% of the target amount at $162.1 million. The non-GAAP operating income thresholds were derived from the revenue thresholds\nbased on the Board-approved budget for 2023. The Compensation Committee believed that reaching these levels would have been\nunlikely without market-share gains and operational effectiveness. In January 2024, under the non-GAAP operating income component,\nbased on the $65.5 million of non-GAAP operating income achieved in 2023, the Compensation Committee determined that none of\nthe total target PSUs awarded would vest in 2024.\nStrategic Goals Component:\nThe PSUs would not vest for the named executive officers with respect to the strategic-goals component of the 2023 Plan if the\nestablished goals were not achieved. Each of the strategic goals was assigned a percentage of 2% to 18% adding up to 30% of the target.\nThe strategic-goals portion of the 2023 Plan consisted of five strategic goals, including goals related to product development, design\nwins impacting future revenue growth, targeted market penetration through flat rate of design wins, increased wafer and manufacturing\ncapacity and manufacturing cost reductions. If all of the strategic goals met or exceeded the minimum established threshold, then the\nnumber of shares subject to PSU vesting for the strategic goals component would have increased linearly from zero at the minimum\nlevel up to 100% if the target strategic goals were met, and up to a maximum of 200% if the stretch strategic goals were met or exceeded.\nIn January 2024, under the strategic goals component, based on the level of strategic goals achieved in 2023, the Compensation\nCommittee determined that approximately 200% of the total target PSUs awarded would vest in 2024.\nLong-term Equity Incentive Awards. In 2023, the Compensation Committee approved grants of RSUs and PRSUs. The RSU\nawards typically have a four-year vesting period with one-fourth of the RSUs vesting on each anniversary of the grant-date over\nfour years, in accordance with the Company’s standard vesting schedule for RSUs. The Company’s PRSU program provides for the\nissuance of PRSUs which will vest on the three-year period ending December 31, 2025, based on the Company’s performance measured\nagainst the PRSU program’s established performance targets. PRSUs are granted in an amount equal to twice the target number of shares\n32\nto be issued if the maximum performance metrics are met. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end\nof a three-year performance period based on results achieved versus the Company’s performance goals, and may range from zero to\n200% of the target number. The actual vesting for PRSUs granted in fiscal 2023 shall be based on higher achievement under either the\n“Relative Measure” or the “Absolute Measure”. The Relative Measure is based on the Company’s compound annual growth rate\n(“CAGR”) of revenue as measured against the revenue CAGR of the analog semiconductor industry (“Relative Measure”), over the\nrespective three-year performance period. The Absolute Measure is a performance goal related to the Company’s revenue growth over\nthe respective three-year performance period as compared to defined internal revenue targets. Both described measures of multi-year\ntargets for growth are intended to have difficulty in attaining. As with the PSUs, the PRSUs are awarded in the amount of 200% of the\nnumber of shares that will ultimately vest if the target revenue threshold is met but not exceeded, with the full amount vesting if the\nmaximum is met or exceeded. The portion of PRSUs that will vest will be calculated as described above for the three-year period ending\nDecember 31, 2025 as compared to the established minimum, target and maximum thresholds, and will vest in early 2026 upon\ndetermination by the Compensation Committee of the achievement of the performance condition. In the event of any mergers,\nacquisitions or divestitures or any patent or other litigation settlements or judgements during the performance period, the minimum,\ntarget and maximum revenue thresholds shall be adjusted based on an approved plan presented to the Board.\nThe 2023 PRSU awards would not vest in early 2026 if the Company’s actual revenue CAGR or net revenues for the three-year\nperiod ending December 31, 2025 does not exceed at least the established minimum threshold amount under either the Relative Measure\nor Absolute Measure, respectively. To the extent the revenue CAGR or net revenues for the three-year period ending December 31, 2025\nexceeds the minimum threshold, the PRSU vesting would increase linearly from zero at the minimum threshold up to 100% of the target\nthreshold, with the number of shares vesting increasing linearly above the target threshold, up to a maximum of 200% of the target\namount of shares based on higher achievement under the Relative Measure or the Absolute Measure. At this point, based on current\nprojections, no vesting of PRSUs would be achieved.\nDetermination of Amounts of RSUs and PRSUs\nThe Compensation Committee approved a target PRSU grant of 40,400 units and a RSU grant of 40,400 units, to\nMr. Balakrishnan. The aggregate target grant-date fair value of these grants was $6.5 million. The Compensation Committee considered\nthe value of the PRSU grant as a percentage of the total long-term equity award. For the chief executive officer’s 2023 equity grants,\nthe Compensation Committee awarded 50% in the form of target PRSUs and 50% in the form of RSUs. This percentage was deemed\nappropriate considering the difficulty of setting long-term performance criteria in an industry experiencing constant and disruptive\nchange.\nThe Compensation Committee approved a target PRSU grant of 8,500 units and a RSU grant of 25,500 units with an aggregate\ntarget grant-date fair value of approximately $2.7 million to Mr. Nayyar. For Mr. Barsan, the Compensation Committee approved a\ntarget PRSU grant of 5,600 units and a RSU grant of 16,800 units with an aggregate target grant-date fair value of approximately\n$1.8 million. For Mr. Gupta the Compensation Committee approved a target PRSU grant of 4,700 units and a RSU grant of 14,100 units\nwith an aggregate target grant-date fair value of approximately $1.5 million. For Mr. Yee, the Compensation Committee approved a\ntarget PRSU grant of 3,300 units and a RSU grant of 9,900 units with an aggregate target grant-date fair value of approximately\n$1.1 million.\nThe total value of the long-term incentive awards for the named executive officers was determined considering both the\nleadership and relative contribution of each executive to the performance of the company, and the long-term incentive pay of peer\ncompanies along with data from Aon. As a group, the value of the long-term incentive grants noted above to the named executive\nofficers was positioned at the 50th percentiles for similar compensation at our peer companies.\nStock Ownership Guideline. In April 2013, the company established a CEO stock-ownership guideline, believing that\nownership of the Company’s common stock is an effective means to reinforce alignment of the chief executive officer’s interests with\nthose of the Company’s stockholders, and such guidelines were amended in April 2021. Our chief executive officer is required to own\na number of shares of the Company’s common stock having a value equal to at least three times his current base salary. This stock\nownership guideline provides for a three-year period to attain the target ownership level. As of March 22, 2024, Mr. Balakrishnan’s\nstock ownership exceeded the stock ownership guidelines.\nEmployment Agreements. The named executive officers are employed at-will. Based on the Company’s desire to link executive\ncompensation with performance, the executive-compensation program does not include employment agreements.\nOther Compensation. Our executive officers are party to benefits agreements and offer letters (“Employment Benefits\nAgreements”) that contain provisions regarding severance benefits in the event the executive is terminated without cause, resigns for\ngood reason or is terminated within 18 months following a change of control or Mr. Balakrishnan ceasing to be our chief executive\nofficer (a “Termination upon Change of Control”).\n33\nIn the event of a termination without cause or resignation for good reason these benefits include (i) a cash severance payment\nbased upon the executive’s highest annual salary from the company in the preceding three years and 50% of the value of the executive’s\nannual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum applicable performance level (100% in the case of\nMr. Balakrishnan), (ii) payment of a pro-rated portion, based on the number of days served in the performance period, of the executive’s\ntargeted annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum applicable performance level, (iii) the pro-rated portion of\nany PRSUs earned prior to termination at the performance level as determined by the Board or Compensation Committee on the date of\ndetermination, (iv) continued health coverage and (v) in the case of Mr. Balakrishnan, accelerated vesting of stock options and RSUs.\nIf the executive incurs a Termination upon Change of Control, the benefits include (i) a cash severance payment based upon\nthe executive’s highest annual salary from the company in the preceding three years and 50% of the value of the executive’s annual\nperformance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum applicable performance level (200% in the case of Mr. Balakrishnan and\nup to 100% in the case of any senior executives), (ii) payment of a pro-rated portion of the executive’s targeted annual performance-\nbased equity incentive awards at the maximum applicable performance level, (iii) 100% accelerated vesting of outstanding PSUs and\nPRSUs at the maximum applicable performance level, (iv) in the case of a change of control without termination, 25% accelerated\nvesting of stock options and RSUs, provided, however (a) Mr. Balakrishnan’s stock options and RSUs vest in full, and (b) 50% (or\n100% if a senior executive) of all stock options and RSUs shall vest in full prior to Change of Control to the extent the acquiring\ncompany does not assume the company’s stock options and RSUs.\nAfter a set age, if an executive officer retires following an extended amount of service to our company, the executive officer\nmay also receive continued health plan coverage, a pro-rated portion of any PRSUs earned prior to termination at the performance level\nas determined by the Board or Compensation Committee, and extended time to exercise stock options pursuant to the Employment\nBenefits Agreements. The Compensation Committee approved these Employment Benefits Agreements because it believes these\nseverance provisions are necessary to retain our current executives and to attract future executives. The level of benefits under the\nEmployment Benefits Agreements was established by the Compensation Committee to provide retention incentives in line with similar\nincentives at comparable companies. Certain of these severance benefits are coupled with non-competition and non-solicitation\nobligations intended to protect our proprietary data that might not be enforceable in the absence of additional consideration. The\nseverance benefits are also intended to attract and retain executive officers by mitigating the risk of employment and compensation loss\ndue to a change of control. A summary of the material terms of these Employment Benefits Agreements, together with a quantification\nof the benefits available under the benefits agreements, may be found in the section below entitled “Summary of Executive\nCompensation-Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and Change of Control Agreements.”\nPerquisites and Generally Available Benefit Programs. We annually review the perquisites that named executive officers\nreceive. Our named executive officers, like our other employees, are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan. In\naddition, the named executive officers may participate in the various employee benefit plans that are generally available to all employees,\nincluding medical, vision and dental care plans; flexible spending accounts for healthcare; life, accidental death and dismemberment\nand disability insurance; and paid time off.\nWe also maintain a 401(k) retirement savings plan for the benefit of all of our employees, including our named executive\nofficers. In 2023, 2022 and 2021 Power Integrations contributed to the employee 401(k) plan; the plan provided a contribution match\nof 4% of salary up to a maximum of $13,200 in 2023, $12,200 in 2022, and $11,600 in 2021.The Company’s contribution is discretionary\nand the decision to contribute is made by the company each year based on business conditions. We do not provide specified retirement\nprograms such as pension plans, or deferred compensation plans. We provide certain retirement benefits to the named executive officers,\nas described below under the heading “Retirement Benefits.”\nCompensation “Clawback”. In 2009, we implemented a compensation “clawback” mechanism with respect to compensation\nof our executive officers. The claw-back conditions the payment of any cash or equity bonuses to executive officers on an agreement to\nrepay a portion of the bonuses in the event of a financial accounting restatement resulting from error or intentional misconduct by the\nofficers. Specifically, any officer determined by the Board to have engaged in intentional misconduct resulting in material\nnoncompliance by the company with any financial reporting requirements of federal securities laws, in turn resulting in the restatement\nof any financial statement filed in the twelve months prior to the bonus payout, will reimburse the company the difference between the\namount of any bonus received and the amount the officer would have received had the amount of the bonus been calculated based on\nthe restated financial statements. We adopted a new Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy, effective as of October 2, 2023 to\ncomply with Nasdaq listing standards, which requires the “clawback” of incentive compensation paid to current and former executive\nofficers when that compensation is based upon achievement of financial results that later require a restatement whether or not resulting\nfrom error or intentional misconduct by such executive officers.\nA copy of the Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy is included as Exhibit 97 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n34\nCompensation Committee Report*\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis\ncontained in this proxy statement. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board\nthat the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated into Power Integrations’ Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nCompensation Committee:\nWendy Arienzo (Chair)\nNicholas Brathwaite\nNancy Gioia\n∗ The material in this report is not “soliciting material,” is not deemed “filed” with the SEC, and is not to be incorporated by reference\ninto any filing of Power Integrations under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act, whether made\nbefore or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language contained in such filing.\n35\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following table shows the compensation awarded to, or earned by, our chief executive officer, our chief financial officer\nand our three other most highly compensated executive officers serving in such capacity at December 31, 2023.

Assumptions used in the\ncalculation of these amounts are included in Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the case of annual and long-term performance-based\nequity incentive awards granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021, all of which were subject to certain performance conditions, as further\ndescribed in the “Compensation Discussion & Analysis” section with respect to the 2023 grants, the fair value at the grant date\nis based upon the probable outcome of the satisfaction of the performance conditions. The grant-date fair value was calculated\nby multiplying the closing stock price on the grant date by each award, reduced by the discounted present value of dividends\nexpected to be declared before the awards vest.\na. The amounts for 2023 are presented at target. Assuming the maximum level of performance conditions was achieved\nfor performance-based awards, the grant-date fair value of the stock awards granted to Mr. Balakrishnan, Mr. Nayyar,\nMr. Barsan, Mr. Gupta and Mr. Yee in 2023 is $11,755,296, $4,112,345, $2,896,047, $2,451,509 and $1,871,719,\nrespectively.\nb. The amounts for 2022 are presented at target.

For a description of the 2023 Plan, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis.”\n(2) Reflects PSUs granted pursuant to the 2023 Plan, which were granted under the 2016 Incentive Award Plan. No PSUs were to\nvest if Power Integrations’ 2023 actual revenue or revenue AGR relative to the analog semiconductor industry, actual non-\nGAAP operating income and strategic goals did not exceed at least established minimum amounts as set forth in the 2023 Plan;\ntarget represents the number of performance stock units which would have vested if the metrics in the 2023 Plan were met at\ntarget; and maximum represents the maximum awards which would have vested if the metrics in the 2023 Plan were met at or\nabove the maximum amounts, which maximum number of performance is 200% of the target number. Payouts were to increase\nlinearly from the minimum to target and target to maximum, based on performance. The Compensation Committee determined\nthat Power Integrations satisfied the strategic goals component under the 2023 Plan at the maximum level. Accordingly,\napproximately 60% of the target PSUs vested and the underlying shares were issued in February 2024.\n(3) Reflects PRSUs granted. No PRSUs are to vest if Power Integrations’ revenue CAGR for the three-year period ending\nDecember 31, 2025, or its 2025 net revenues, do not exceed at least the minimum amounts specified in the relative and absolute\nperformance measures respectively. Target represents the number of PRSUs which would vest if Power Integrations’\nperformance equals the target threshold specified by either measure; maximum represents the awards which would vest if\nPower Integrations’ performance equals or exceeds the established maximum amounts relative to that respective measure.\n37\n(4) Restrictions on the RSU awards lapse at the rate of 25% per year with full vesting on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant,\nsubject to the awardee’s continued service to the Company.\n(5) Represents the grant-date fair value of stock awards as determined in accordance with ASC 718. In the case of time-based\nRSUs, the grant-date fair value was calculated by multiplying the closing price of our common stock on the grant date by the\nnumber of shares underlying the award reduced by the discounted present value of dividends expected to be declared before\nthe awards vest. In the case of performance-based equity incentive awards, the grant-date fair value is presented at target, which\nrepresented the probable outcome of the satisfaction of the performance conditions at the date of grant.\nThe amount of salary and grant-date fair value of performance-based equity incentive awards in proportion to total\ncompensation in 2023 varied by executive but was consistent with the Compensation Committee’s objectives with respect to executive\ncompensation. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” above for a discussion of our 2023 annual and long-term performance\nstock units and other elements of compensation.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at 2023 Fiscal Year-End\nThe following table shows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, certain information regarding outstanding equity\nawards at fiscal year-end for the named executive officers.

In May 2014, Power Integrations entered into an amended and restated chief executive\nofficer benefits agreement with Balu Balakrishnan, which was amended in June 2020 solely to clarify a definition therein (as amended,\nthe “CEO Benefits Agreement”) and amended and restated executive officer benefits agreements with Sandeep Nayyar, chief financial\nofficer, and Radu Barsan, vice president, technology, which were also amended in June 2020 solely to clarify a definition therein. An\nexecutive officer benefits agreement was also entered into with Sunil Gupta, vice president, operations, and Yang Chiah Yee, vice\npresident, worldwide sales, in connection with commencement of their employment in February 2021 and July 2021, respectively, of\nwhich both were amended in August 2022 solely to grant Mr. Gupta and Mr. Yee the benefits of a senior executive. The executive\nofficers’ benefits agreements referenced in this paragraph, including the CEO Benefits Agreement, as amended as the case may be, are\nreferred to as the “Executive Officer Benefits Agreements,” and the executive officers referred to in this paragraph, are referred to as\nthe “Officers.” The Executive Officer Benefits Agreements, as amended as the case may be, provide for certain benefits, as described\n39\nbelow, including: acceleration of vesting of stock options, RSUs, and in certain circumstances, PSUs, and PRSUs, upon a change of\ncontrol of Power Integrations,\n• severance benefits in the event of termination of employment by Power Integrations without cause or resignation by\nthe Officer for good reason within 18 months after a change of control or change in our chief executive officer (a\n“Termination Upon Change of Control”),\n• severance benefits in the event of termination of employment by Power Integrations without cause or resignation by\nthe Officer for good reason, and\n• retirement benefits.\nThese benefits are coupled with non-competition obligations that might not be enforceable in the absence of additional\nconsideration. The executive officers must also execute a release of claims in a form reasonably satisfactory to the company and continue\nto abide by the terms and conditions of any confidentiality and/or proprietary rights agreement between the respective executive officers\nand the company.\nA change of control is defined in the Executive Officer Benefits Agreements as an acquisition by any person of a beneficial\nownership of 50% or more of Power Integrations’ voting stock or outstanding shares of common stock, certain mergers or other business\ncombinations involving Power Integrations, the sale of more than 50% of Power Integrations’ assets, liquidation of Power Integrations,\nor a change in the majority of the incumbent members of the Board within a two-year period (except changes in the Board’s composition\napproved by a majority of the directors). “Cause” includes, among other acts, a material act of theft, dishonesty, fraud, falsification of\nrecords, improper disclosure of confidential information, or an intentional act by the Officer causing harm to the reputation of Power\nIntegrations, and “good reason” includes, among other acts, a material decrease in the Officer’s compensation or benefits following a\nchange of control, a demotion or material reduction in responsibility level, or relocation of more than 50 miles from the Officer’s current\nwork place or a material adverse change in working conditions or established working hours which persist for a period of six months.\nUpon a change of control, 100% of Mr. Balakrishnan’s then-unvested shares subject to options or RSUs will vest and all then-\nunvested shares subject to PSUs and PRSUs shall accelerate and vest at the maximum performance level for each applicable award\nimmediately prior to the consummation of the change of control. With respect to the other Officers, upon a change of control, 100% of\nthe then-unvested shares subject to PSUs and PRSUs shall accelerate and vest at the maximum performance level for each applicable\naward immediately prior to the consummation of the change of control, and 25% of the Officer’s then-unvested shares subject to options\nor RSUs will vest. However, if an acquiring company does not assume the options or RSUs, 50% of the Officer’s then-unvested shares\nwill vest if the Officer is a “new executive” (generally an executive with fewer than five years of service to Power Integrations as an\nexecutive officer) and 100% of the Officer’s then-unvested shares will vest if the Officer is a “senior executive” (generally an executive\nwith at least five years of continuous service to Power Integrations as an executive officer). Mr. Nayyar, Mr. Barsan, Mr. Gupta and\nMr. Yee are senior executives.\nMr. Balakrishnan is entitled to severance benefits in the event that he is terminated without cause or he resigns for good reason\nwithin 18 months after a change of control. These severance benefits include a payment equal to the sum of two years of his highest\nannual salary in the preceding three years (or his currently effective salary if it would be his highest annual salary) from Power\nIntegrations plus 200% of the cash value of his targeted annual performance-based equity incentive awards, at the maximum achievable\nperformance level (whether consisting of cash or stock awards, measured as of the date of termination). Also, Mr. Balakrishnan shall\nreceive the cash value of that portion of his then effective targeted annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum\nachievable performance level as measured on the date of termination, prorated based on days through the date of termination (i.e., a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the applicable performance period prior to such termination of employment\nand the denominator of which is the total number of days in the applicable performance period). In addition, Mr. Balakrishnan shall\nreceive accelerated vesting of 100% of all his then-outstanding stock options and other stock awards (to the extent such stock awards\ndo not constitute a portion of his annual performance-based equity incentive awards), extension of the post-termination stock option\nexercise period to one year, and continued medical and dental coverage under the Power Integrations’ health plans for twenty-\nfour months at Power Integrations’ expense.\nEach Officer other than Mr. Balakrishnan is entitled to severance benefits in the event that such Officer is terminated without\n“cause” or resigns for “good reason” within 18 months after (i) a change of control or (ii) the date that Mr. Balakrishnan ceases to serve\nas chief executive officer. These severance benefits include a payment equal to six months of the Officer’s highest annual salary in the\npreceding three years (or the Officer’s currently effective salary if it would be such Officer’s highest annual salary) from Power\nIntegrations plus the cash value of 50% of the Officer’s targeted annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum\nachievable performance level (whether consisting of cash or stock awards measured as of the date of termination) and for a senior\nexecutive, up to an additional six months of the Officer’s highest annual salary and the cash value of 50% of the Officer’s annual\nperformance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum achievable performance level (whether consisting of cash or stock awards,\nmeasured as of the date of termination) until such senior executive secures new employment, paid on a ratable monthly basis. Also, the\nOfficer shall receive the cash value of that portion of the Officer’s then effective targeted annual performance-based equity incentive\n40\nawards at the maximum achievable performance level as measured on the date of termination, prorated based on days through the date\nof termination (i.e., a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the applicable performance period prior to such\ntermination of employment and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the applicable performance period). In addition,\neach Officer is entitled to the accelerated vesting of 50% of then-unvested shares subject to options or stock awards (to the extent such\nstock awards do not constitute a portion of the Officer’s annual performance-based equity incentive awards) if the Officer is a new\nexecutive, or vesting of 100% of then unvested shares subject to options or stock awards (to the extent such stock awards do not constitute\na portion of the Officer’s annual performance-based equity incentive awards) if the Officer is a senior executive, extension of the post-\ntermination stock option exercise period to one year for vested options, and continued medical and dental coverage under the Power\nIntegrations’ health plans at Power Integrations’ expense for up to six months if the Officer is a new executive, or for up to twelve months\nif the Officer is a senior executive.\nIn addition, each Officer is entitled to severance benefits in the event of termination of employment by Power Integrations\nwithout cause or resignation by such Officer for good reason. Such severance benefits include a payment equal to six months\n(twelve months in the case of Mr. Balakrishnan) of the Officer’s highest annual salary in the preceding three years (or the Officer’s\ncurrently effective salary if it would be such Officer’s highest annual salary) plus 50% (100% in the case of Mr. Balakrishnan) of the\nOfficer’s annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum achievable performance level (whether consisting of cash\nor stock awards, measured as of the date of termination), and the cash value of that portion of the Officer’s then effective targeted annual\nperformance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum achievable performance level as measured on the date of termination,\nprorated based on days through the date of termination. In addition, each Officer and Mr. Balakrishnan is entitled to receive a pro rata\nportion of any outstanding PRSUs based on the number of days served by such Officer, or Mr. Balakrishnan, prior to the date of\ntermination as compared to the performance period for such PRSUs, with any such PRSU vesting at the performance levels as determined\nby the Power Integrations’ Board or Compensation Committee on the date of determination, as well as continued medical and dental\ncoverage under the Power Integrations’ health plans for six months (twelve months in the case of Mr. Balakrishnan) at Power\nIntegrations’ expense. In addition, Mr. Balakrishnan is entitled to vesting acceleration of 50% of all his then-unvested stock options and\nRSUs.\nEach Officer is entitled to retirement benefits if he has served Power Integrations for 15 years and has achieved an age of 50,\nor has served Power Integrations for 10 years and has achieved an age of 55, is not employed elsewhere, full time (other than for an\norganization described in section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), or otherwise engaged in “Competition”\n(as defined in the Executive Officer Benefits Agreement) with Power Integrations, and does not recruit or employ any present or future\nemployee of Power Integrations. The Officer is entitled to the extension of his post-termination stock option exercise period for vested\noptions for the earlier of the term of the option (not to exceed five years in the case of Officers other than Mr. Balakrishnan) or the\ntermination of the option in connection with any change of control and medical and dental benefits for such Officer and such Officer’s\ndependents at Power Integrations’ expense until such Officer achieves the age of 65; thereafter, participation in the health plans would\nbe at the Officer’s expense. In addition, each Officer and Mr. Balakrishnan is entitled to receive a pro-rated portion of any outstanding\nPRSUs based on the number of days served by such Officer or Mr. Balakrishnan, prior to the date of retirement as compared to the\nperformance period for such PRSUs, with any such PRSU vesting at the performance levels as determined by the Power Integrations’\nBoard or Compensation Committee on the date of determination. In the event the Officer’s service to Power Integrations’ is terminated\ndue to death or permanent disability after satisfying the requirements to achieve retirement benefits, such Officer, or such Officer’s\nbeneficiaries, shall be entitled to the preceding benefits.\nPower Integrations will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that the Officer will continue to be eligible for coverage\nunder Power Integrations’ medical and dental plans upon retirement. These retirement benefits will also become available if an Officer\nwas eligible for such benefits and his employment terminates due to death or disability.\nIf any of the payments and benefits provided under the Executive Officer Benefits Agreements in connection with a change of\ncontrol (the “Payments”) would result in a “parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,\nthe amount of such Payments will be either (i) the full amount of the Payments or (ii) a reduced amount which would result in no portion\nof the Payments being subject to excise tax (as defined in the Executive Officer Benefits Agreements, as amended), whichever amount\nprovides the greatest amount of benefit to the Officer.\n41\nRetirement Benefits\nThe following table provides information concerning the actuarial present value of retirement health benefits as of\nDecember 31, 2023, for each named executive officer.\nPresent Value of\nNumber of Years Accumulated\nName Credited Service Benefit (in $000)\nBalu Balakrishnan .............................................................. 35 —\nSandeep Nayyar ............................................................... 13 $ 18\nRadu Barsan .................................................................. 10 —\nSunil Gupta ................................................................... 2 $ 35\nYang Chiah Yee ............................................................... 2 $ 39\nHaving reached the appropriate age and the required years of service with Power Integrations, Mr. Nayyar and his spouse are\neligible to receive medical benefits upon retirement until they achieve the age of 65. Having reached the age of 65 Messrs. Balakrishnan\nand Barsan are not eligible to receive medical benefits upon retirement. The valuation method and all material assumptions are as\nfollows: The amounts determined in the above table are associated with the provision of health care coverage after retirement. The\nvaluation method is pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification 715, Retirement\nBenefits Compensation, (“ASC 715”). The Projected Unit Credit attribution method was used; the attribution of the obligation is over\nthe period from hire to benefit eligibility (the earlier of age 50 with 15 years of service or age 55 with 10 years of service). Other than\nfor eligibility purposes, service is not considered in the calculation. The benefit consists of health-care coverage from retirement until\nage 65. The basis for the benefit is premiums paid by the employer to a third-party insurer, without additional subsidy imputed. The\nobligations were calculated using the following assumptions:\n• The discount rate for future payments was 6.01% as of December 31, 2023.\n• The assumed annual increase in health care costs is 10% as of December 31, 2023, with the annual increase lessening\nby ½% per year, to an ultimate rate of 5% after 2035.\n• 25% of active participants are assumed to become eligible and elect coverage at retirement.\n• Retirement is assumed to take place at age 62, or at first eligibility if older.\n• 2/3 of active employees are assumed to have eligible spouses who, at the employee’s retirement, will be covered by\nthe plan. Husbands are assumed to be three years older than their wives.\n42\nPotential Payments upon Retirement or Change of Control\nThe following table provides information concerning the estimated payments and benefits that would be provided in each of\nthe circumstances described above. Payments and benefits are estimated assuming that the triggering event took place on December 31,\n2023, and the price per share of Power Integrations’ common stock is $82.11, the closing price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on\nDecember 29, 2023, the last trading day of 2023. There can be no assurance that a triggering event would produce the same or similar\nresults as those estimated below if such event occurs on any other date or at any other price, or if any other assumption used to estimate\npotential payments and benefits is not correct. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any potential payments\nor benefits, any actual payments and benefits may be different. The information presented below assumes no adjustment of the payment\nof benefits to help avoid excise tax under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\nPotential Payments Upon Involuntary\nTermination Other Than for Cause or\nVoluntary Termination for Good Continuation of Service Without Termination\nReason After Change of Control\nNot within 18 Within 18\nmonths of a months of a Acquiring Company Acquiring Company\nRetirement Change of Change of Assumes Does Not Assume\nName/Type of Benefit Benefits Control (1) Control (2) RSUs/PRSUs(3) RSUs/PRSUs(4)\nBalu Balakrishnan\nCash Severance-Base Salary ..................... $ — $ 710,000 $ 1,420,000 $ — $ —\nSeverance-Equity Bonus (5) ...................... — 1,970,640 3,941,280 1,970,640 1,970,640\nRSU Vesting Acceleration (6) ..................... — 5,312,517 10,625,034 10,625,034 10,625,034\nPRSU Vesting Acceleration (7) .................... — — 17,144,568 17,144,568 17,144,568\nContinued Coverage of Employee Benefits (8) ........ — 27,494 54,988 — —\nTotal Termination Benefits: (9) .................... $ — $ 8,020,651 $ 33,185,870 $ 29,740,242 $ 29,740,242\nSandeep Nayyar\nCash Severance-Base Salary ..................... $ — $ 225,000 $ 450,000 $ — $ —\nSeverance-Equity Bonus (5) ...................... — 344,862 689,724 689,724 689,724\nRSU Vesting Acceleration (6) ..................... — — 4,403,149 1,100,787 4,403,149\nPRSU Vesting Acceleration (7) .................... — — 2,791,740 2,791,740 2,791,740\nContinued Coverage of Employee Benefits (8) ........ 36,045 25,301 50,602 — —\nTotal Termination Benefits: (9) .................... $ 36,045 $ 595,163 $ 8,385,215 $ 4,582,251 $ 7,884,613\nRadu Barsan\nCash Severance-Base Salary ..................... $ — $ 207,500 $ 415,000 $ — $ —\nSeverance-Equity Bonus (5) ...................... — 320,229 640,458 640,458 640,458\nRSU Vesting Acceleration (6) ..................... — — 3,304,928 826,232 3,304,928\nPRSU Vesting Acceleration (7) .................... — — 2,052,750 2,052,750 2,052,750\nContinued Coverage of Employee Benefits (8) ........ — 9,917 19,834 — —\nTotal Termination Benefits: (9) .................... $ — $ 537,646 $ 6,432,970 $ 3,519,440 $ 5,998,136\nSunil Gupta\nCash Severance-Base Salary ..................... $ — $ 192,500 $ 385,000 $ — $ —\nSeverance-Equity Bonus (5) ...................... — 279,174 558,348 558,348 558,348\nRSU Vesting Acceleration (6) ..................... — — 2,367,149 591,787 2,367,149\nPRSU Vesting Acceleration (7) .................... — — 1,642,200 1,642,200 1,642,200\nContinued Coverage of Employee Benefits (8) ........ — 25,301 50,602 — —\nTotal Termination Benefits: (9) .................... $ — $ 496,975 $ 5,003,299 $ 2,792,335 $ 4,567,697\nYang Chiah Yee\nCash Severance-Base Salary ..................... $ — $ 192,500 $ 385,000 $ — $ —\nSeverance-Equity Bonus (5) ...................... — 270,963 541,926 541,926 541,926\nRSU Vesting Acceleration (6) ..................... — — 1,976,716 494,179 1,976,716\nPRSU Vesting Acceleration (7) .................... — — 1,439,388 1,439,388 1,439,388\nContinued Coverage of Employee Benefits (8) ........ — 28,323 56,646 — —\nTotal Termination Benefits: (9) .................... $ — $ 491,786 $ 4,399,676 $ 2,475,493 $ 3,958,030\n(1) Reflects benefits in the event of involuntary termination other than for cause or voluntary termination for good reason: with\nrespect to Mr. Balakrishnan twelve months salary plus his annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum\napplicable performance level (measured as of the termination date), plus 50% acceleration of all his then-unvested RSUs plus\ntwelve months medical and dental coverage;

The PSUs deemed vested will be paid in shares of\nPower Integrations’ common stock equal to the number of PSUs deemed vested, and the market value is determined using\n$82.11 per share, the closing price per share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market at December 29, 2023, the last trading day of\n2023.\n(6) Reflects the aggregate market value of unvested RSU awards for which vesting would accelerate in such event. The aggregate\nmarket value is computed by multiplying (i) $82.11, the closing price per share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on\nDecember 29, 2023, the last trading day of 2023, by (ii) the number of unvested awards that would be subject to accelerated\nvesting in such event at December 31, 2023.\n(7) Reflects the aggregate market value of unvested PRSU awards for which vesting would accelerate in such event. The aggregate\nmarket value is computed by multiplying (i) $82.11, the closing price per share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on\nDecember 29, 2023, the last trading day of 2023, by (ii) the number of unvested awards that would be subject to accelerated\nvesting in such event at December 31, 2023.\n(8) For retirement, upon completion of service and age requirements, health coverage is paid until the age of 65. For severance,\nreflects the cost of health coverage (COBRA) to maintain the benefits currently provided, calculated based upon the rates at\nDecember 31, 2023.\n(9) The total termination benefits received by the Officer for termination within 18 months of a change of control may be lower\nthan what is stated in this table in light of a provision in the Officers’ respective Executive Officers Benefits Agreement which\nstates that if any of the payments and benefits provided under such agreements (the “Payments”) in connection with a change\nof control would result in a “parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the amount of such\nPayments will be either (i) the full amount of the Payments or (ii) a reduced amount which would result in no portion of the\nPayments being subject to excise tax (as defined in the respective agreements), whichever amount provides the greatest amount\nof benefit to the Officer.\nThe table above describes potential payments to our Officers in the event of retirement or a change of control as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The table includes the acceleration of outstanding performance stock units in connection with a change of control.\nPolicy on Hedging\nOur Board has adopted a policy that prohibits directors, executive officers and other “insiders” from engaging in short sales,\ntransactions in put or call options, hedging transactions or other inherently speculative transactions with respect to our common stock at\nany time. Further, our employee handbook extends this policy to all of our employees.\n44\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION\nPower Integrations’ Compensation Committee consists of Dr. Arienzo, Mr. Brathwaite and Ms. Gioia. None of the current\nmembers of the Compensation Committee is or has ever been an officer or employee of Power Integrations or its subsidiaries. None of\nPower Integrations’ executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has\none or more executive officers serving as a member of Power Integrations’ Board or Compensation Committee.\nPay Ratio\nThe annual total compensation of the median employee and the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer were\ncalculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. Using the methodology described below, our\nCEO’s annual total compensation in 2023 as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement was\n$8,218,982 and our median employee’s annual total compensation in 2023 was $98,813. As a result, our 2023 CEO to median employee\npay ratio was approximately 83:1.\nWe chose December 1, 2023 as the date for establishing the employee population used in identifying the median employee and\nused fiscal 2023 the measurement period. We identified the median employee using a consistently applied compensation measure which\nincludes annual base salary or wages, target annual performance-based equity awards based on their grant date fair values, target\ncommissions and target long-term equity awards based on their grant date fair values. Permanent employees who joined in 2023 and\npermanent employees who were on leave during 2023 were assumed to have worked for the entire year. All U.S. and non-U.S. employees\nemployed as of December 1, 2023 were captured. No cost-of-living adjustments were made.\nThis pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our human resources system\nof record and the methodology described above. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and\ncalculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to\napply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio\nreported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment\nand compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their\nown pay ratios.\nPAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE\nThe Compensation Actually Paid, (“CAP”) disclosed below for our Principal Executive Officer (“PEO”) and Non-PEO named\nexecutive officers “Non-PEO NEOs”, which represents the average amounts of all named executive officers excluding our PEO, was\ncalculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K. The CAP figures presented in the table below\nincorporate total executive compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table adjusted for changes in the fair value of\nequity awards and pension benefits. Accordingly, CAP does not equate to the amount that is actually paid to any executive in a given\nyear and is merely a measurement determined by the SEC in an effort to identify the relationship between executive compensation and\na Company’s financial performance.\nThe following table sets forth the CAP to our PEO and average of our Non-PEO NEOs, serving in such capacity, along with\ncertain measures of Company performance in each of the four years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020:\nSummary Av erage Summary Average Value of I ni tia l Fixed\nCompensation Compensation Compensation Compensation $100 Investment Based on\nTable Actually Paid Table Total for Actually Paid Total Shareholder Peer Group\nTotal to the Non-PEO to Non-PEO Return Total Shareholder (in thousands)\nYear for PEO PEO (1) (2) NEOs NEOs (1) (3) (TSR) - POWI Return (4) Net Income Net Revenues\n2023 ... $ 8,218,982 $ 6,836,603 $ 2,503,959 $ 2,415,342 $ 171.35 $ 238.72 $ 55,735 $ 444,538\n2022 ... $ 7,015,329 $ (13,137,041) $ 1,737,581 $ (725,064) $ 148.28 $ 142.94 $ 170,851 $ 651,138\n2021 ... $ 6,564,685 $ 16,724,842 $ 1,784,763 $ 3,351,766 $ 190.35 $ 219.51 $ 164,413 $ 703,277\n2020 ... $ 5,733,115 $ 23,622,794 $ 1,514,513 $ 4,824,198 $ 166.78 $ 153.66 $ 71,176 $ 488,318\n(1) See supplemental disclosures below for adjustments made to arrive at CAP for PEO and Non-PEO NEOs.\n(2) For fiscal years 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020, Balu Balakrishnan served as our President and Chief Executive officer.\n(3) For fiscal years 2023, Non-PEO NEOs were Sandeep Nayyar, Radu Barsan, Sunil Gupta and Yang Chiah Yee. For fiscal 2022\nand 2021, Non-PEO NEOs were Sandeep Nayyar, Radu Barsan, Mike Matthews and Yang Chiah Yee. For fiscal year 2020,\nNon-PEO NEOs were Sandeep Nayyar, Radu Barsan, Mike Matthews and Ben Sutherland.\n45\n(4) Peer Group TSR is based on Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) (the “Industry Index”). SOX is\na market cap weighted index of 30 US-listed semiconductor companies.\nThe following graph shows the relationship between CAP and TSR for both the Company and Industry Index, as represented\nby the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Sector Index. TSR shows the cumulative total return on an investment of $100 in\ncash on December 31, 2019, through December 31, 2023, in our common stock and the Industry Index, assuming that all dividends were\nreinvested. The return shown on the graph below is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and we do not make or endorse\nany predictions as to future stockholder returns.\nThe following graph shows the relationship between CAP and Net Income:\n46\nThe following graph shows the relationship between CAP and Net Revenues:\nThe following are the Company’s three most important performance measures for determining NEO compensation for 2023:\n2023 Performance Measures\nNet Revenues\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\nRelative Revenue (1)\n(1) Relative Revenue refers to the Company’s Revenue CAGRs as compared to the Revenue CAGR of the analog semiconductor\nindustry over similar periods. See section “Mechanics of 2023 Performance-based Equity Incentive Awards” above for\nfurther details.\nPay versus Performance Supplemental Disclosures\nAs demonstrated graphically above, the compensation of our named executive officers is structured in a way that closely aligns\ncompensation with overall company performance and further serves to align executive and stockholders’ interests. As described in the\n“Executive Compensation Components” section above, a significant portion of executive compensation is given in the form of RSUs,\nPSUs and PRSUs. That section also describes the performance conditions upon which PSUs and PRSUs are valued and thresholds which\nultimately determine the number of shares that would vest. For purposes of calculating CAP, the fair value of stock awards is driven by\nchanges in the Company’s stock price and in the case of performance-based awards, changes in the expected achievement of the\nperformance targets.\nThe below table shows the reconciliation between amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table to arrive at CAP for\nour PEO.\nSummary Exclusion of Exclusion of Inclusion of Inclusion of Compensation\nCompensation Change in Stock Pension Service Equity Actually\nTable Total for Pension Value for Awards for Cost for Values for Paid to\nYear PEO PEO PEO PEO PEO (1) PEO\n2023 .............. $ 8,218,982 — $ 7,497,159 — $ 6,114,780 $ 6,836,603\n2022 .............. $ 7,015,329 — $ 6,310,294 — $ (13,842,076) $ (13,137,041)\n2021 .............. $ 6,564,685 — $ 5,890,071 — $ 16,050,228 $ 16,724,842\n2020 .............. $ 5,733,115 — $ 5,080,867 — $ 22,970,546 $ 23,622,794\n(1) As calculated in table below for Total – Inclusion of Equity Values PEO.\n47\nThe below table shows the reconciliation between amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table to arrive at CAP on\naverage for our Non-PEO NEOs.\nAverage Average Average Average Average Average\nSummary Exclusion of Exclusion of Inclusion of Inclusion of Compensation\nCompensation Change in Stock Pension Service Equity Actually\nTable Total Pension Value for Awards for Cost for Values for Paid to\nYear Non-PEO NEOs Non-PEO NEOs Non-PEO NEOs Non-PEO NEOs Non-PEO NEOs (1) Non-PEO NEOs\n2023 .............. $ 2,503,959 — $ 2,080,893 — $ 1,992,276 $ 2,415,342\n2022 .............. $ 1,737,581 — $ 1,325,853 — $ (1,136,792) $ (725,064)\n2021 .............. $ 1,784,763 — $ 1,415,573 — $ 2,982,576 $ 3,351,766\n2020 .............. $ 1,514,513 — $ 1,145,772 — $ 4,455,457 $ 4,824,198\n(1) As calculated in table below for Total - Average Inclusion of Equity Values Non-PEO NEOs.\nThe fair value of our equity awards is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718-10, Stock Compensation.\nTime-vested restricted stock unit grant date fair values are calculated using the stock price as of date of grant.

Brathwaite. During fiscal 2023, we did not have any other related-party\ntransactions requiring review, nor did we have any transactions where the policy and procedure were not followed.\n48\nHOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS\nThe SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for\nNotices of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and Annual Meeting materials with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the\nsame address by delivering a single Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or set of Annual Meeting materials addressed to\nthose stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially means extra convenience for\nstockholders, allows us to save money by reducing the number of documents we must print and mail and helps protect the environment\nas well.\nHouseholding is available to both registered stockholders (i.e., those stockholders with certificates registered in their name)\nand street name holders (i.e., those stockholders who hold their shares through a brokerage).\nIf you are a registered stockholder and have consented to our mailing of proxy materials and other stockholder information\nonly to one account in your household, as identified by you, we will deliver or mail a single copy of our Notice of Internet Availability\nof Proxy Materials or set of Annual Meeting materials, as applicable, for all registered stockholders residing at the same address unless\ncontrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that it will be\nhouseholding communications to your address, householding, will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your\nconsent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a Notice of Internet Availability\nof Proxy Materials or a separate set of printed Annual Meeting materials, as applicable, please notify your broker or direct your written\nrequest to Investor Relations Department, Power Integrations, Inc., 5245 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, California 95138-1002, or contact\nthe Investor Relations Department at (408) 414-8528.

Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Notice of\nInternet Availability of Proxy Materials or set of Annual Meeting materials, as applicable, at their address and would like to request\nhouseholding of their communications should contact their brokers.\nOTHER MATTERS\nThe Board knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are\nproperly brought before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote on such matters\nin accordance with their best judgment.\nBy Order of the Board of Directors.\n/s/ Sandeep Nayyar\nSandeep Nayyar\nChief Financial Officer & Vice President of Finance\nMarch 29, 2024\nA copy of Power Integrations’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, is available\nat www.power.com.
