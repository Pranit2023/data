Blaser, President and Chief Executive Officer, QuidelOrtho. “We remain focused on our top business-critical priorities, including delivering on our customer commitments with the highest levels of quality and compliance, as well as executing on company-wide cost-savings and business efficiency initiatives. Further, we continue to reinforce the strength of our leadership team with key talent hires, while also aligning our organization to be more agile, reducing complexity and increasing customer focus.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024**\n\nThe Company reported total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 of $727 million, compared to $744 million in the prior year period. The decrease in total revenue was primarily due to higher COVID-19 and influenza revenue in the prior year period. Foreign currency translation impacted the Company’s Labs business by 100 basis points but did not significantly impact the Company’s overall third quarter 2024 revenue. \n\nGAAP diluted loss per share for the third quarter of 2024 was ($0.30), compared to diluted loss per share of ($0.19) in the prior year period. GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $20 million, compared to $13 million in the prior year period. GAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $15 million, compared to an operating income of $26 million in the prior year period, and GAAP operating margin was 2%, compared to 4% in the prior year period. Third quarter 2024 results included $37 million in integration-related charges. \n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.85, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.90 in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $171 million, compared to $169 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 23.5%, compared to 22.7% in the prior year period. \n\n_____________________________  \n---  \n1 |  Recurring revenue, a non-GAAP measure, means revenues from sales of our assays, reagents, consumables and services, and excludes instruments. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures.   \n2 |  Operating expenses includes Selling, Marketing and Administrative and Research and Development expenses.   \n  \n**Full-year 2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nThe Company reinstated its full year 2024 financial guidance as of November 7, 2024, as follows: \n\nTotal revenues (reported)  |  $2.75 - $2.80 billion   \n---|---  \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $530 – $550 million   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin  |  19.3% - 19.6%   \nAdjusted diluted EPS  |  $1.69 - $1.91   \n_Please see the Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results presentation on the “Investor Relations” page of the Company’s website for the assumptions on which the Company’s 2024 financial guidance is based._  \n  \nJoseph Busky, Chief Financial Officer of QuidelOrtho remarked, “Our decision to reinstate our full year financial guidance reflects our solid performance in the first nine months of the year, and more importantly, increased visibility into the impact of our cost-savings initiatives. This 2024 financial guidance is in line with the commentary we shared earlier this year. Looking forward, the cost-savings initiatives support our previously announced plan to achieve $100 million in annualized cost-savings and position us to realize incremental cost-savings in the future.” \n\nA reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted EPS, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not provided because comparable GAAP measures for such measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation. We are not, without unreasonable effort, able to reliably predict the impact of impairment charges and related tax benefits, employee compensation costs and other adjustments. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and may have a material impact on our future GAAP results. In addition, the Company believes any such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nQuidelOrtho will hold a conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss its financial results.

These statements are any statement contained herein that is not strictly historical, including, but not limited to, QuidelOrtho’s commercial, integration and other strategic goals, financial guidance and other future financial condition and operating results, including results of cost-savings initiatives, and other future plans, objectives, strategies, expectations and intentions. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “might,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “goal,” “project,” “strategy,” “future,” “continue” or similar words, expressions or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the beliefs and expectations of QuidelOrtho’s management as of today and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or outcomes may differ significantly from those set forth or implied in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth or implied in the forward-looking statements: fluctuations in demand for QuidelOrtho’s non-respiratory and respiratory products; supply chain, production, logistics, distribution and labor disruptions and challenges; the challenges and costs of integrating, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies as a result of the business combination of Quidel Corporation and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics Holdings plc; and other macroeconomic, geopolitical, market, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting the business of QuidelOrtho generally, including those discussed in QuidelOrtho’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), including under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of the Form 10-K. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events because these statements are based on assumptions that may not come true and are speculative by their nature. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to QuidelOrtho and speak only as of the date hereof. QuidelOrtho undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking information or time-sensitive information included in this press release, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed expectations or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release contains financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, including but not limited to “recurring revenue, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue,” “constant currency, recurring revenue and revenue changes, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue,” “constant currency, Labs revenue and revenue changes,” “non-GAAP operating expenses,” “adjusted diluted EPS,” “adjusted EBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA margin,” “adjusted free cash flow” and other non-GAAP financial measures included in the reconciliation tables accompanying this press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures eliminate impacts of certain non-cash, unusual or other items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance, and the Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management’s financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the Company’s historical operating results and comparison to competitors’ operating results. The Company’s definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and reports filed with the Commission in their entirety. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release. \n\n**QuidelOrtho** Consolidated Statements of Operations  (Unaudited)  (In millions except per share data)   \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \nTotal revenues  |  $  |  727.1  |  $  |  744.0  |  $  |  2,075.1  |  $  |  2,255.2   \nCost of sales, excluding amortization of intangibles  |  374.8  |  374.6  |  1,114.7  |  1,140.7   \nSelling, marketing and administrative  |  186.4  |  194.1  |  579.3  |  575.6   \nResearch and development  |  55.9  |  61.5  |  171.4  |  185.7   \nAmortization of intangible assets  |  51.9  |  51.4  |  155.5  |  153.6   \nIntegration related costs  |  36.8  |  26.5  |  90.3  |  80.4   \nGoodwill impairment charge  |  —  |  —  |  1,743.9  |  —   \nAsset impairment charge  |  —  |  2.2  |  56.9  |  3.2   \nOther operating expenses  |  6.3  |  7.4  |  23.6  |  17.0   \nOperating income (loss)  |  15.0  |  26.3  |  (1,860.5  |  )  |  99.0   \nInterest expense, net  |  42.9  |  37.7  |  122.9  |  110.9   \nOther expense, net  |  0.9  |  4.1  |  7.2  |  8.0   \nLoss before income taxes  |  (28.8  |  )  |  (15.5  |  )  |  (1,990.6  |  )  |  (19.9  |  )   \nBenefit from income taxes  |  (8.9  |  )  |  (2.8  |  )  |  (117.0  |  )  |  (2.8  |  )   \nNet loss  |  $  |  (19.9  |  )  |  $  |  (12.7  |  )  |  $  |  (1,873.6  |  )  |  $  |  (17.1  |  )   \nBasic loss per share  |  $  |  (0.30  |  )  |  $  |  (0.19  |  )  |  $  |  (27.92  |  )  |  $  |  (0.26  |  )   \nDiluted loss per share  |  $  |  (0.30  |  )  |  $  |  (0.19  |  )  |  $  |  (27.92  |  )  |  $  |  (0.26  |  )   \nWeighted-average shares outstanding -

Corporation\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of QuidelOrtho Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company” or\n“QuidelOrtho”) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and\nArticle 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete\nfinancial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation (consisting of normal\nrecurring accruals) have been included. Refer to the Summary of Abbreviated Terms at the end of this Quarterly Report for definitions of\nterms used throughout the document.\nThe information at September 29, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, is unaudited. For\nfurther information, refer to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2023 included in QuidelOrtho’s Annual Report. Operating results for any quarter are historically seasonal in nature and are not necessarily\nindicative of the results expected for the full year.\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year that ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December, and fiscal quarters\nthat end on the Sunday nearest to the end of the months of March, June and September. For 2024 and 2023, the Company’s fiscal year will\nend or has ended on December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For 2024 and 2023, the Company’s third quarter ended on\nSeptember 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively. The three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 each\nincluded 13 and 39 weeks, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior periods amounts to conform to the current period presentation. Such amounts include a\nreclassification of $2.2 million and $3.2 million recognized in the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively, related to\nimpairment of long-lived assets from (i) Cost of sales, excluding amortization of intangibles (excludes $1.3 million and $1.4 million for the\nthree and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively), and (ii) Research and development (excludes $0.9 million and $1.8 million for\nthe three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively), to Asset impairment charge.\nThe reclassifications did not have an impact on the Company’s previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements\nof Comprehensive Income (Loss), Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThere have been no accounting pronouncements issued or adopted during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 that are expected to\nhave a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 2. Computation of Earnings Per Share\nThe following table presents the calculation of the weighted-average shares used in computing basic and diluted EPS in the respective\nperiods:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 67.3 66.9 67.1 66.8\nDilutive potential shares issuable from stock options and RSUs(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:12) — — — —\nDiluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 67.3 66.9 67.1 66.8\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 11/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\n10\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 12/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\n(1) In the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, all potential shares of common stock issuable for stock options and RSUs\nwere excluded from the dilutive calculations above because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of potential\nshares of common stock issuable for stock options and RSUs on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding would have been\nas follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 67.3 66.9 67.1 66.8\nDilutive potential shares issuable from stock options and RSUs 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.5\nDiluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 67.5 67.3 67.4 67.3\nStock options and RSUs where the combined exercise price and unrecognized stock-based compensation was greater than the average\nmarket price for the Company’s common stock were not included in the computations of diluted weighted-average shares because the effect\nwould have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. These stock options and RSUs represented 1.9 million and 2.0 million shares\nof common stock for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and 1.7 million and 1.6 million shares of common\nstock for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively.\nNote 3. Revenue\nContract Balances\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an asset when revenue is recognized\nprior to invoicing a customer (a “contract asset”). Contract assets are included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the\nCompany’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and are transferred to accounts receivable when the right to payment becomes unconditional. The\nbalance of contract assets recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was\n$39.5 million and $46.2 million, respectively.\nThe contract asset balance consisted of the following components:\n• a customer supply agreement under which the difference between the timing of invoicing and revenue recognition resulted in a\ncontract asset of $1.9 million as of December 31, 2023. There was no contract asset remaining as of September 29, 2024;\n• contractual arrangements with certain customers under which the Company invoices the customers based on reportable results\ngenerated by its reagents; however, control of the goods transfers to the customers upon shipment or delivery of the products, as\ndetermined under the terms of the contract. Using the expected value method, the Company estimates the number of reagents that\nwill generate a reportable result. The Company records the revenue upon shipment and an associated contract asset, and relieves\nthe contract asset upon completion of the invoicing. The balance of the contract asset related to these arrangements was $39.5\nmillion and $41.8 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively; and\n• one of the Company’s contract manufacturing agreements that recognizes revenue as the products are manufactured resulted in a\ncontract asset of $2.5 million as of December 31, 2023. There was no contract asset remaining as of September 29, 2024.\nThe Company reviews contract assets for expected credit losses resulting from the collectability of customer accounts. Expected losses are\nestablished based on historical losses, customer mix and credit policies, current economic conditions in customers’ country or industry, and\nexpectations associated with reasonable and supportable forecasts. No credit losses related to contract assets were recognized during the\nthree and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023.\nThe Company recognizes a contract liability when a customer pays an invoice prior to the Company transferring control of the goods or\nservices (“contract liabilities”). The Company’s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue primarily related to customer service\ncontracts.

At the end of each interim period, the Company estimates its annual effective tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary\nquarterly earnings to calculate the tax related to ordinary income. The tax effects for other items that are excluded from ordinary income are\ndiscretely calculated and recognized in the period in which they occur.\nFor the three months ended September 29, 2024, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $8.9 million in relation to loss before\nincome taxes of $28.8 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.9%. For the three months ended October 1, 2023, the Company\nrecognized an income tax benefit of $2.8 million in relation to loss before income taxes of $15.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of\n18.1%. For the three months ended September 29, 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to\nthe utilization of net operating losses previously not benefited due to valuation allowances. For the three months ended October 1, 2023, the\neffective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to net operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited\ndue to the establishment of valuation allowances and Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, partially offset by non-U.S. earnings being taxed\nat rates that were different than the U.S. statutory rate, R&D credits, foreign tax credits and foreign exchange losses.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $117.0 million in relation to loss before\nincome taxes of $1,990.6 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 5.9%. For the nine months ended October 1, 2023, the Company\nrecognized an income tax benefit of $2.8 million in relation to loss before income taxes of $19.9 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of\n14.1%. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to\ngoodwill impairment charges that were nondeductible for tax purposes. For the nine months ended October 1, 2023, the effective tax rate\ndiffered from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to net operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the\nestablishment of valuation allowances and Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, partially offset by non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that\nwere different than the U.S. statutory rate, R&D credits, foreign tax credits and foreign exchange losses.\nThe balance of unrecognized tax benefits at September 29, 2024, not including interest and penalties, was $30.1 million, of which $22.6\nmillion could affect the effective income tax rate in future periods, if recognized. The Company also recognizes interest and penalties related\nto unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. At September 29, 2024, the Company had approximately $4.5 million of interest and penalties\naccrued related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company estimates that within the next 12 months, its uncertain tax positions, excluding\ninterest, should decrease by $11.7 million.\nThe Company is subject to periodic audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Due to the carryforward of unutilized credits, the\nCompany’s federal tax years from 2012 and onwards are subject to examination by the U.S. authorities. The Company’s state and foreign\ntax years for 2001 and onwards are subject to examination by applicable tax authorities. The Company believes that it has appropriate\nsupport for the income tax positions taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an\nassessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.\n(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)I(cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nOrtho is currently under audit in certain jurisdictions for tax years under the responsibility of Johnson & Johnson.

Assets Held for Sale\nThe following criteria are considered before concluding assets are classified as held for sale: 1) management’s commitment to a plan to sell,\n2) availability for immediate sale in its present condition, 3) initiation of an active program to identify a buyer, 4) probability of a completed\nsale within one year, 5) actively marketed for sale at a reasonable price in relation to its current fair value, and 6) likelihood of significant\nchanges to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. If all of the criteria are met as of the balance sheet date, the net assets\nare presented separately in the balance sheet as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and is no\nlonger depreciated or amortized while classified as held for sale. The Company assesses the fair value of a long-lived asset less any costs to\nsell at each reporting period and until the asset is no longer classified as held for sale.\nAs part of the Company’s cost-savings initiatives, the Company has been evaluating its real estate footprint with the goal to relocate and\nconsolidate its operations to improve long-term results. As a result, the Company has decided to (i) sell the McKellar, San Diego, CA facility\nand (ii) sell the Raritan, NJ facility with the intent to subsequently lease back the right to use the property. In the second quarter of 2024, the\nproperties met the requirements for reclassification from property, plant and equipment, net to assets held for sale when it became probable\nthat the properties would be sold within one year. The carrying value of the assets was reduced to its estimated relative fair value less costs\nto sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $56.9 million that was included in Asset impairment charge.\nNote 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\nChanges in goodwill were as follows:\n(In millions) North America EMEA China Other Total\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 1,743.9 $ 582.4 $ 85.7 $ 80.0 $ 2,492.0\nImpairment charge (1,743.9) — — — (1,743.9)\nForeign currency translation — 21.8 1.6 (0.9) 22.5\nBalance at September 29, 2024 $ — $ 604.2 $ 87.3 $ 79.1 $ 770.6\n16\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 18/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter and monitors throughout the year for\nimpairment triggering events that indicate that the carrying value of one or more of its reporting units exceeds its fair value.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company concluded that (i) the sustained decline in the Company’s stock price and market\ncapitalization that occurred during the first quarter of 2024, (ii) the faster than expected decline in COVID-19 and flu markets, and (iii) the\ndelay in the timing of expected commercialization for Savanna were triggering events requiring an interim goodwill impairment assessment\nfor all reporting units.\nBased on the Company’s interim goodwill impairment assessment in the first quarter of 2024, the Company concluded that the North\nAmerica reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill\nimpairment charge of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024 for the North America reporting unit, which represented a full impairment of\nthe goodwill allocated to the North America reporting unit. The decline in the estimated fair value of the North America reporting unit and\nthe resulting impairment were primarily driven by revised short-term and mid-term forecasts for revenue and EBITDA expectations in North\nAmerica.\nThe estimated fair values of the EMEA, Latin America and JPAC reporting units as of the interim testing date exceeded their respective\ncarrying values. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective\nreporting unit) ranged from approximately 30% to 150%. Due to the significant excess of fair value over carrying value of these reporting\nunits, they are less sensitive to changes in forecast assumptions. To evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the interim\ngoodwill impairment test for the EMEA, Latin America and JPAC reporting units, the Company applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the\nfair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical\n5% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective\nreporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 25% to 140%.\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units consisted of a fair value calculation that combines an income\napproach, using a discounted cash flow method, and a market approach, using the guideline public company method. The quantitative\ngoodwill impairment assessment requires the application of a number of significant assumptions, including estimates of future revenue\ngrowth rates, EBITDA margins, discount rates and market multiples. The projected future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, and\nthe resulting projected cash flows are based on historical experience and internal annual operating plans reviewed by management,\nextrapolated over the forecast period. Discount rates are determined using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk factors\nspecific to the reporting units. Market multiples are based on the guideline public company method using comparable publicly traded\ncompany multiples of revenue and EBITDA for a group of benchmark companies.\nThe Company believes the assumptions that were used in the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment are reasonable and consistent\nwith assumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants.\nThe Company also reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthe carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. Given the indications of possible impairment that occurred during the first\nquarter of 2024, the Company tested its North America long-lived asset group for recoverability and impairment as of March 31, 2024.\nRecoverability of long-lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash\nflows expected to be generated by the asset group. The undiscounted cash flows for the North America long-lived asset group were above\nthe carrying value and the Company determined that the long-lived asset group was recoverable, and no impairment existed as of March 31,\n2024. Subsequent to the first quarter of 2024, no impairment indicators were noted.\n17\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 19/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nNote 9.

Amounts related to the three and nine\nmonths ended September 29, 2024 were not material.\nNote 11. Commitments and Contingencies\nOn April 12, 2024, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action complaint under the federal securities laws against\nthe Company and three of its current and former executives. The complaint, which is captioned Bristol County Retirement System v.\nQuidelOrtho Corporation, et al., Case No. 1:24-cv-02804-MKV (S.D.N.Y.) (the “Bristol County Complaint”), asserts claims for violations\nof Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder related to statements regarding sales of the\nCompany’s COVID-19 diagnostic tests and the 510(k) submission for its Savanna RVP4 assay. The Bristol County Complaint seeks a\njudgment determining that the lawsuit can be maintained as a class action and awarding the plaintiff and putative class damages, pre- and\npost-judgment interest, attorneys’ and experts’ fees, and costs.\nOn April 25, 2024, and June 21, 2024, two purported stockholders of the Company filed separate stockholder derivative complaints,\npurportedly on behalf of the Company, against the current and certain former members of the Company’s Board of Directors and three of its\ncurrent and former executives. The complaints, which are captioned Matthew Whitfield v. Kenneth F. Buechler, Ph.D., et al., Case No. 1:24-\ncv-03176-MKV (S.D.N.Y.) (the “Whitfield Complaint”), and Steven Pinkney v. Douglas Bryant, et al., Case No. 1:24-cv-4753-MKV\n(S.D.N.Y.) (the “Pinkney Complaint”), assert claims for violations of Sections 10(b), 14(a), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5\nand 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of\ncontrol, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets related to statements regarding sales of the Company’s COVID-19 diagnostic\ntests and the 510(k) submission for its Savanna RVP4 assay. The Whitfield and Pinkney Complaints seek judgments awarding compensatory\nand punitive damages against the individual defendants, directing an accounting by the individual defendants, directing the Company and\nthe individual defendants to take actions to improve the Company’s governance and procedures, and awarding the costs and disbursements\nof the action, including attorneys’ fees, accountants’ and experts’ fees, costs, and expenses.\nThe Company disputes the allegations of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Nevertheless, the outcomes of\nthese lawsuits are uncertain and cannot be predicted with any certainty. Accordingly, at this time, the Company is not able to estimate a\npossible loss or range of loss that may result from these lawsuits or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse\neffect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in other litigation and legal proceedings, including matters related to product liability claims,\ncommercial disputes and intellectual property claims, as well as regulatory, employment, and other claims related to its business. The\nCompany accrues for legal claims when, and to the extent that, amounts associated with the claims become probable and are reasonably\nestimable. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any\nother, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required\nto estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from these matters are inherently difficult\nto predict. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those claims. For\nthose matters as to which the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss, the Company is not able to determine whether\nthe loss will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nManagement believes that all such current legal actions, in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany. However, the resolution of, or increase in any accruals for, one or more matters may have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s results of operations and cash flows.\n19\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 21/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nNote 12. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents the Company’s hierarchy for its assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the\nfollowing periods:\nSeptember 29, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nMarketable securities $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 55.8 $ — $ 55.8\nDerivative assets — 10.3 — 10.3 — 6.9 — 6.9\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ — $ 10.3 $ — $ 10.3 $ — $ 62.7 $ — $ 62.7\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities $ — $ 47.1 $ — $ 47.1 $ — $ 27.5 $ — $ 27.5\nContingent consideration — — — — — — 0.1 0.1\nTotal liabilities measured at fair\nvalue $ — $ 47.1 $ — $ 47.1 $ — $ 27.5 $ 0.1 $ 27.6\nThere were no transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 29,\n2024 and fiscal year 2023.\nMarketable securities consist of investment-grade corporate and government debt securities, corporate asset-backed securities and\ncommercial paper. Derivative financial instruments are based on observable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Observable inputs\ninclude broker quotes, daily market foreign currency rates and forward pricing curves.\nFinancial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value\nThe estimated fair value of the Company’s borrowings under the Term Loan was $2,293.9 million at September 29, 2024, compared to the\ncarrying amount, excluding debt issuance costs, of $2,317.1 million. The estimated fair value of the Company’s borrowings under the Term\nLoan was $2,396.0 million at December 31, 2023, compared to the carrying amount, excluding debt issuance costs, of $2,420.2 million. The\nestimate of fair value is generally based on the quoted market prices for similar issuances of long-term debt with the same maturities, which\nis classified as a Level 2 input.\nNote 13. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company selectively uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage market risk associated with changes in interest rates and\nforeign currency exchange rates. The use of derivatives is intended for hedging purposes only, and the Company does not enter into\nderivative transactions for speculative purposes.\nCredit risk represents the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled\nif all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements\nthat reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. The Company does not have any derivative\ninstruments with credit-risk related contingent features that would require it to post collateral.\nInterest Rate Hedging Instruments\nThe Company’s interest rate risk relates primarily to interest rate exposures on variable rate debt, including the Revolving Credit Facility\nand Term Loan. Refer to “—Note 9. Borrowings” for additional information on the currently outstanding components of the Revolving\nCredit Facility and Term Loan. The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the related risk of the variability to the\nCompany’s cash flows due to the rates specified for these credit facilities.\nThe Company designates its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. The Company records gains and losses due to changes in fair value of\nthe derivatives within OCI and reclassifies these amounts to Interest expense, net in the same period or periods for which the underlying\nhedged transaction affects earnings. In the event the Company determines the hedged transaction is no longer probable to occur or concludes\nthe hedge relationship is no longer effective, the hedge is prospectively de-designated. Pre-tax unrealized loss of $1.3 million as of\nSeptember 29, 2024 is expected to be reclassified from OCI to earnings in the next 12 months.\n20\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 22/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s interest rate derivative agreements as of September 29, 2024, all of which were interest rate\nswaps:\nNotional Amount\n(In millions) Description Hedge Designation Effective Date Expiration Date\n$ 550.0 Pay 3.765% fixed, receive floating rate Designated cash December 30, 2022 May 27, 2027\n(1-month USD-SOFR) flow hedge\n$ 200.0 Pay 3.7725% fixed, receive floating rate Designated cash December 30, 2022 May 27, 2027\n(1-month USD-SOFR) flow hedge\n$ 300.0 Pay 3.7675% fixed, receive floating rate Designated cash December 30, 2022 May 27, 2027\n(1-month USD-SOFR) flow hedge\n$ 400.0 Pay 3.7575% fixed, receive floating rate Designated cash December 30, 2022 May 27, 2027\n(1-month USD-SOFR) flow hedge\n$ 350.0 Pay 3.7725% fixed, receive floating rate Designated cash December 30, 2022 May 27, 2027\n(1-month USD-SOFR) flow hedge\nCurrency Hedging Instruments\nThe Company has currency risk exposures relating primarily to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted\nforeign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and may\nuse option contracts and cross currency swaps to manage its currency risk exposures. The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts are\ndenominated primarily in Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chilean Peso, Chinese Yuan/Renminbi,\nColombian Peso, Czech Koruna, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Mexican Peso, Philippine Peso, South Korean Won, Swiss Franc and\nThai Baht.\nThe Company designates certain foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges. The Company records gains and losses due to\nchanges in fair value of the derivatives within OCI and reclassifies these amounts to Total revenues and Cost of sales, excluding\namortization of intangibles in the same period or periods for which the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. In the event the\nCompany determines the hedged transaction is no longer probable to occur or concludes the hedge relationship is no longer effective, the\nhedge is prospectively de-designated. Pre-tax unrealized gains of $2.2 million as of September 29, 2024 is expected to be reclassified from\nOCI to earnings in the next 12 months.\nThe Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not part of designated hedging relationships and which are\nintended to mitigate exchange rate risk of monetary assets and liabilities and related forecasted transactions. The Company records these\nnon-designated derivatives at mark-to-market with gains and losses recognized in earnings within Other expense, net.\nThe following table provides details of the currency hedging instruments outstanding as of September 29, 2024:\nNotional Amount\nDescription (In millions) Hedge Designation\nForeign currency forward contracts $ 188.7 Cash Flow Hedge\nForeign currency forward contracts $ 833.6 Non-designated\n21\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 23/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nThe following table summarizes pre-tax gains and losses from designated derivative and non-derivative instruments within AOCI for the\nthree and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023:\nDesignated Hedging Instruments\nAmount of Loss (Gain) Recognized Location of Amounts Reclassified Amount of Loss (Gain) Reclassified\n(In millions) in OCI on Hedges from AOCI into Income from AOCI into Income\nThree Months Ended September 29, 2024\nForeign currency forward contracts\n(sales) $ 3.2 Total revenues $ —\nForeign currency forward contracts Cost of sales, excluding\n(purchases) $ (0.1) amortization of intangibles $ 0.3\nInterest rate derivatives $ 41.7 Interest expense, net $ (7.1)\nNine Months Ended September 29, 2024\nForeign currency forward contracts\n(sales) $ (2.8) Total revenues $ 2.1\nForeign currency forward contracts Cost of sales, excluding\n(purchases) $ 0.7 amortization of intangibles $ 0.3\nInterest rate derivatives $ (4.1) Interest expense, net $ (21.3)\nThree Months Ended October 1, 2023\nForeign currency forward contracts\n(sales) $ (1.0) Total revenues $ 1.8\nForeign currency forward contracts Cost of sales, excluding\n(purchases) $ (0.1) amortization of intangibles $ 0.4\nInterest rate derivatives $ (28.0) Interest expense, net $ (8.5)\nNine Months Ended October 1, 2023\nForeign currency forward contracts\n(sales) $ 0.7 Total revenues $ 2.7\nForeign currency forward contracts Cost of sales, excluding\n(purchases) $ (2.2) amortization of intangibles $ 2.1\nInterest rate derivatives $ (54.1) Interest expense, net $ (21.1)\nThe Company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against movements in\nexchange rates. The forward exchange contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in foreign operations. The unrealized gains\nor losses on these contracts are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments within OCI, and remain in AOCI until either the sale or\ncomplete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. The Company excludes certain portions of the change in fair value of its\nderivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded components). Changes in fair value of the excluded\ncomponents are recognized in OCI. The Company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the excluded components on a straight-line\nbasis over the life of the derivative instrument.\nThe effect of the Company’s net investment hedges on OCI and the Consolidated Statements of Loss are shown below:\nNet Investment Hedging Relationships\nAmount of Pre-tax (Gain) Loss Recognized in\nOther Expense, Net for Amounts Excluded from\n(In millions) Amount of Pre-tax Loss (Gain) Recognized in OCI Effectiveness Testing\nThree Months Ended September 29, 2024\nForeign exchange contracts $ 20.2 $ (3.3)\nNine Months Ended September 29, 2024\nForeign exchange contracts $ 1.9 $ (8.2)\nFair value gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts, as determined using Level 2 inputs, that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting treatment are recorded in Other expense, net.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn this Quarterly Report, all references to “we,” “our” and “us” refer to QuidelOrtho Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nFuture Uncertainties and Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\nSection 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These statements are any statement contained herein that is not\nstrictly historical, including, but not limited to, certain statements under Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations,” including under “Outlook” and “Liquidity Outlook,” and located elsewhere herein regarding our\ncommercial, integration and other strategic goals, our cost-savings initiatives, industry prospects, our expected results of operations or\nfinancial position, and future plans, objectives, strategies, expectations and intentions. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “may,”\n“will,” “would,” “should,” “might,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “goal,” “project,” “strategy,” “future,”\n“continue” or similar words, expressions or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-\nlooking statements. Such statements are based on the beliefs and expectations of our management as of the date of this Quarterly Report and\nare subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or outcomes may differ significantly from those set\nforth or implied in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set\nforth or implied in the forward-looking statements: fluctuations in demand for our non-respiratory and respiratory products; supply chain,\nproduction, logistics, distribution and labor disruptions and challenges; the challenges and costs of integrating, restructuring and achieving\nanticipated synergies as a result of the Combinations; and other macroeconomic, geopolitical, market, business, competitive and/or\nregulatory factors affecting our business generally, including those discussed under Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report\nand Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report. Investors should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future\nevents because these statements are based on assumptions that may not come true and are speculative by their nature. All forward-looking\nstatements are based on information currently available to us and speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. We undertake no\nobligation to update any of the forward-looking information or time-sensitive information included in this Quarterly Report, whether as a\nresult of new information, future events, changed expectations or otherwise, except as required by law.\nInformation Available on Our Website\nThis Quarterly Report and each of our other periodic and current reports, including any amendments thereto, are available, free of charge, on\nour website, www.quidelortho.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nFrom time to time, we may use our website as a channel of distribution of material information related to the Company. Financial and other\nmaterial information regarding the Company is routinely posted on and accessible at https://ir.quidelortho.com/. The information contained\non or connected to our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report or filed with or furnished to the SEC\nand should not be considered part of this Quarterly Report.\nOverview\nOur vision is to advance diagnostics to power a healthier future. With our expertise in immunoassay and molecular testing, clinical\nchemistry and transfusion medicine, we aim to support clarity for clinicians and patients to help create better health outcomes. Our global\ninfrastructure and commercial reach support our customers across more than 130 countries and territories with quality diagnostics, a broad\ntest portfolio and market-leading service. We operate globally with manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and U.K. and with sales centers,\nadministrative offices and warehouses located throughout the world.\nWe manage our business geographically to better align with the market dynamics of the specific geographic regions in which we operate,\nwith our reportable segments being North America, EMEA and China. Latin America and JPAC (Japan and Asia Pacific) are immaterial\noperating segments that are not considered reportable segments and are included in “Other.” We generate our revenue in the following\nbusiness units: Labs, Immunohematology, Donor Screening, Point of Care and Molecular Diagnostics.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, Total revenues decreased by 8% to $2,075.1 million as compared to the same period in the\nprior year, primarily driven by variability of our U.S. respiratory products. Currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 100 basis\npoints on our growth rate. Our revenues can be highly concentrated over a small number of products, including certain of our respiratory\nproducts. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, revenues related to our respiratory products accounted for\napproximately 17% and 24% of our Total revenues, respectively.\n25\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 27/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nPlanned Wind-Down of U.S. Donor Screening Portfolio\nIn February 2024, we initiated a wind-down plan to transition out of the U.S. donor screening portfolio. Specifically, we plan to wind-down\nonly the ORTHO VERSEIA® Integrated Processor platform and microplate assays, which are only sold in the U.S., and have a lower\ngrowth and margin profile. This wind-down will not affect any donor screening portfolio outside of the U.S. While our goal is to wind-down\nthis U.S. donor screening portfolio, we will continue to support our existing customers and honor our contractual commitments. The\nwinding down of the U.S. donor screening portfolio, as compared to the prior year periods, contributed to the decline in revenue with a\nmargin lower than our overall margin. Refer to Item 1, “Financial Statements—Note 3. Revenue” for more information. The wind-down of\nour U.S. donor screening portfolio is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2025.\nOutlook\nOur financial performance and results of operations will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain,\ncontinuously evolving and unpredictable, including the occurrence, spread, severity, duration and emergence of new variants of respiratory\ndiseases, including flu, strep, RSV and COVID-19, as well as ongoing supply, production and logistics challenges.\nWe expect overall demand for our non-respiratory and respiratory products to continue to fluctuate and pricing pressures on certain products\nto persist as a result of a number of factors, including increased supply, emergence and spread of new variants, and the seasonal demands of\nthe respiratory season, which are typically more prevalent during the fall and winter.\nBecause our business environment is highly competitive, our long-term growth and profitability will depend in part on our ability to retain\nand grow our current customers and attract new customers through developing and delivering new and improved products and services that\nmeet our customers’ needs and expectations, including with respect to product performance, product offerings, cost, automation and other\nwork-flow efficiencies. As a result, we expect to continue to maintain our emphasis on R&D investments for longer term growth, including\nfor our next generation platforms and assays, as well as additional assays to be launched on our current platforms. In addition, we expect to\ncontinue to evaluate strategic opportunities to (i) expand our product lines and services, production capabilities, technologies and\ngeographic footprint and address other business challenges and opportunities, and (ii) rationalize and consolidate facilities with the goal to\nimprove our long-term results.\nWhile we expect the revenues and financial results from our non-respiratory and respiratory products to be affected by the highly\ncompetitive environment and our respiratory products to be affected by the seasonal demands of the respiratory season, we intend to\ncontinue our focus on prudently managing our business and delivering improved financial results, while at the same time striving to\nintroduce new products and services into the market.\nSeasonality\nRevenues from our respiratory products are subject to, and significantly affected by, the seasonal demands of the cold, flu and RSV seasons,\nwhich are typically more prevalent during the fall and winter. Historically, revenues from our influenza products have varied from year to\nyear based, in large part, on the severity, length and timing of the onset of the cold, flu and RSV seasons. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 virus\nmay have similar seasonal demands and impacts on our revenues in the future.\nResults of Operations\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nThe following table compares Total revenues by business unit for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1,\n2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nOctober 1, October 1,\n(Dollars in millions) September 29, 2024 2023 % Change September 29, 2024 2023 % Change\nLabs $ 355.9 $ 341.4 4 % $ 1,067.0 $ 1,073.5 (1)%\nImmunohematology(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:12) 132.0 128.9 2 % 385.9 380.1 2 %\nDonor Screening(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:12) 28.0 35.0 (20)% 95.7 103.0 (7)%\nPoint of Care 205.6 233.1 (12)% 509.3 675.4 (25)%\nMolecular Diagnostics 5.6 5.6 — % 17.2 23.2 (26)%\nTotal revenues $ 727.1 $ 744.0 (2)% $ 2,075.1 $ 2,255.2 (8)%\n26\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 28/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 29/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\n(1) For presentation purposes, as a result of the wind-down of the U.S. donor screening portfolio, the previously reported Transfusion Medicine business\nunit is shown in its two product categories: Immunohematology and Donor Screening. Prior periods have been revised to align with the current period\npresentation.\nFor the three months ended September 29, 2024, Total revenues decreased to $727.1 million from $744.0 million for the same period in the\nprior year. Labs revenue increased 4% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to growth in recurring revenue, which includes\nreagents, consumables and services in our Labs revenue, partially offset by a decline in instrument revenue. Excluding foreign currency\nimpact, Labs revenue increased 5% compared to the prior year period. Immunohematology revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year\nperiod, primarily due to reagent growth. Donor Screening revenue decreased 20% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the\nwind-down of the U.S. donor screening business. Point of Care revenue decreased 12% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to\nlower sales of Sofia SARS Antigen assays, partially offset by an increase in demand for QuickVue SARS Antigen assays. Currency\nexchange rates did not significantly impact our growth rate for the three months ended September 29, 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, Total revenues decreased to $2,075.1 million from $2,255.2 million for the same period in\nthe prior year. Labs revenue decreased 1% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a $19.2 million settlement award from a third\nparty related to one of our collaboration agreements in the prior year period, partially offset by growth in recurring revenue.\nImmunohematology revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to reagent growth. Donor Screening revenue\ndecreased 7% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the wind-down of the U.S. donor screening business. The Point of Care\nbusiness unit contributed to revenue decline, driven by a decrease of $178.9 million in sales of QuickVue SARS Antigen assays, primarily\ndue to a COVID-19 government award in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase of $11.8 million in sales of Sofia SARS\nAntigen assays. Molecular Diagnostics sales decreased by $6.0 million, driven primarily by lower demand. Currency exchange rates had an\nunfavorable impact of approximately 100 basis points on our growth rate for the nine months ended September 29, 2024.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)[ (cid:0)F (cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)P (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)] (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)L(cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nCost of sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, increased to $374.8 million, or 51.5% of Total revenues, for the three months\nended September 29, 2024, compared to $374.6 million, or 50.3% of Total revenues, for the three months ended October 1, 2023.

Our operations in Latin America and\nJPAC (Japan and Asia Pacific) are immaterial operating segments that are not considered reportable segments and are included in “Other.”\nThe key indicators that we monitor are as follows:\n• Total revenues — This measure is discussed in the section entitled “Results of Operations.”\n• Adjusted EBITDA — Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segment is used by our management to measure and evaluate the internal\noperating performance of our reportable segments. It is also the basis for calculating certain management incentive compensation\nprograms. We believe that this measurement is useful to investors as a way to analyze the underlying trends in our core business,\nincluding at the segment level, consistently across the periods presented and to evaluate performance under management incentive\ncompensation programs.

Our R&D costs may be substantial as we move product\ncandidates into preclinical and clinical trials and advance our existing product candidates into later stages of development.\nThe primary purposes of our capital expenditures are to invest in manufacturing capacity expansion, acquire certain of our instruments,\nacquire scientific equipment, purchase or develop IT and implement facility improvements. We plan to fund the capital expenditures with\nthe cash on our balance sheet.\nWe are focused on expanding the number of instruments placed in the field and solidifying long-term contractual relationships with\ncustomers. In order to achieve this goal, in certain jurisdictions where it is permitted, we have leveraged a reagent rental model that has been\nrecognized as more attractive to certain customers. In this model, we lease, rather than sell, instruments to our customers. Over the term of\nthe contract, the purchase price of the instrument is embedded in the price of the assays and reagents. Going forward, we intend to increase\nthe number of reagent rental placements in developed markets, a strategy that we believe is beneficial to our commercial goals because it\nlowers our customers’ upfront capital costs and therefore allows purchasing decisions to be made at the lab manager level. For these same\nreasons, the reagent rental model also benefits our commercial strategy in emerging markets. We believe that the shift in our sales strategy\nwill grow our installed base, thereby increasing sales of higher-margin assays, reagents and other consumables over the life of the customer\ncontracts and enhancing our recurring revenue and cash flows.

The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Our critical accounting\nestimates are those that significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or\ncomplex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this\nuncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.\n33\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 36/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nA comprehensive discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report.

As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.7 billion in the first\nquarter of 2024 for the North America reporting unit, which represented a full impairment of the goodwill allocated to the North America\nreporting unit. The decline in the estimated fair value of the North America reporting unit and the resulting impairment were primarily\ndriven by revised short-term and mid-term forecasts for revenue and EBITDA expectations in North America.\nThe estimated fair values of our EMEA, Latin America and JPAC reporting units as of the interim testing date exceeded their respective\ncarrying values. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective\nreporting unit) ranged from approximately 30% to 150%. Due to the significant excess of fair value over carrying value of these reporting\nunits, they are less sensitive to changes in forecast assumptions. To evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the interim\ngoodwill impairment test for the EMEA, Latin America and JPAC reporting units, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values\nof each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 5% decrease,\nthe excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for\neach of our reporting units ranged from approximately 25% to 140%.\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units consisted of a fair value calculation that combines an income\napproach, using a discounted cash flow method, and a market approach, using the guideline public company method. The quantitative\ngoodwill impairment assessment requires the application of a number of significant assumptions, including estimates of future revenue\ngrowth rates, EBITDA margins, discount rates and market multiples. The projected future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, and\nthe resulting projected cash flows are based on historical experience and internal annual operating plans reviewed by management,\nextrapolated over the forecast period. Discount rates are determined using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk factors\nspecific to the reporting units. Market multiples are based on the guideline public company method using comparable publicly traded\ncompany multiples of revenue and EBITDA for a group of benchmark companies.\nWe believe the assumptions that were used in the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment are reasonable and consistent with\nassumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants.\nITEM 3.

Blaser, President and Chief Executive Officer, QuidelOrtho. “We remain focused on our top business-critical priorities, including delivering on our customer commitments with the highest levels of quality and compliance, as well as executing on company-wide cost-savings and business efficiency initiatives. Further, we continue to reinforce the strength of our leadership team with key talent hires, while also aligning our organization to be more agile, reducing complexity and increasing customer focus.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024**\n\nThe Company reported total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 of $727 million, compared to $744 million in the prior year period. The decrease in total revenue was primarily due to higher COVID-19 and influenza revenue in the prior year period. Foreign currency translation impacted the Company’s Labs business by 100 basis points but did not significantly impact the Company’s overall third quarter 2024 revenue. \n\nGAAP diluted loss per share for the third quarter of 2024 was ($0.30), compared to diluted loss per share of ($0.19) in the prior year period. GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $20 million, compared to $13 million in the prior year period. GAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $15 million, compared to an operating income of $26 million in the prior year period, and GAAP operating margin was 2%, compared to 4% in the prior year period. Third quarter 2024 results included $37 million in integration-related charges. \n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.85, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.90 in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $171 million, compared to $169 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 23.5%, compared to 22.7% in the prior year period. \n\n_____________________________  \n---  \n1 |  Recurring revenue, a non-GAAP measure, means revenues from sales of our assays, reagents, consumables and services, and excludes instruments. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures.   \n2 |  Operating expenses includes Selling, Marketing and Administrative and Research and Development expenses.   \n  \n**Full-year 2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nThe Company reinstated its full year 2024 financial guidance as of November 7, 2024, as follows: \n\nTotal revenues (reported)  |  $2.75 - $2.80 billion   \n---|---  \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $530 – $550 million   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin  |  19.3% - 19.6%   \nAdjusted diluted EPS  |  $1.69 - $1.91   \n_Please see the Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results presentation on the “Investor Relations” page of the Company’s website for the assumptions on which the Company’s 2024 financial guidance is based._  \n  \nJoseph Busky, Chief Financial Officer of QuidelOrtho remarked, “Our decision to reinstate our full year financial guidance reflects our solid performance in the first nine months of the year, and more importantly, increased visibility into the impact of our cost-savings initiatives. This 2024 financial guidance is in line with the commentary we shared earlier this year. Looking forward, the cost-savings initiatives support our previously announced plan to achieve $100 million in annualized cost-savings and position us to realize incremental cost-savings in the future.” \n\nA reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted EPS, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not provided because comparable GAAP measures for such measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation. We are not, without unreasonable effort, able to reliably predict the impact of impairment charges and related tax benefits, employee compensation costs and other adjustments. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and may have a material impact on our future GAAP results. In addition, the Company believes any such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nQuidelOrtho will hold a conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss its financial results.

These statements are any statement contained herein that is not strictly historical, including, but not limited to, QuidelOrtho’s commercial, integration and other strategic goals, financial guidance and other future financial condition and operating results, including results of cost-savings initiatives, and other future plans, objectives, strategies, expectations and intentions. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “might,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “goal,” “project,” “strategy,” “future,” “continue” or similar words, expressions or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the beliefs and expectations of QuidelOrtho’s management as of today and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or outcomes may differ significantly from those set forth or implied in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth or implied in the forward-looking statements: fluctuations in demand for QuidelOrtho’s non-respiratory and respiratory products; supply chain, production, logistics, distribution and labor disruptions and challenges; the challenges and costs of integrating, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies as a result of the business combination of Quidel Corporation and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics Holdings plc; and other macroeconomic, geopolitical, market, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting the business of QuidelOrtho generally, including those discussed in QuidelOrtho’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), including under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of the Form 10-K. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events because these statements are based on assumptions that may not come true and are speculative by their nature. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to QuidelOrtho and speak only as of the date hereof. QuidelOrtho undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking information or time-sensitive information included in this press release, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed expectations or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release contains financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, including but not limited to “recurring revenue, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue,” “constant currency, recurring revenue and revenue changes, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue,” “constant currency, Labs revenue and revenue changes,” “non-GAAP operating expenses,” “adjusted diluted EPS,” “adjusted EBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA margin,” “adjusted free cash flow” and other non-GAAP financial measures included in the reconciliation tables accompanying this press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures eliminate impacts of certain non-cash, unusual or other items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance, and the Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management’s financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the Company’s historical operating results and comparison to competitors’ operating results. The Company’s definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and reports filed with the Commission in their entirety.

All Rights Reserved. 2\nForward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nForward-Looking Statements: This presentation of QuidelOrtho Corporation (“QuidelOrtho” or the “Company”) contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are any statement contained herein that is not strictly historical, including, but not limited to, QuidelOrtho’s financial guidance and other\nfuture financial condition and operating results, including results of cost-savings initiatives, and other future plans, objectives, strategies, expectations and intentions. Without limiting the foregoing, the\nwords “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “might,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “goal,” “project,” “strategy,” “future,” “continue” or similar words, expressions or the\nnegative of such terms or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the beliefs and expectations of QuidelOrtho’s management\nas of today and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or outcomes may differ significantly from those set forth or implied in the forward-looking\nstatements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth or implied in the forward-looking statements: fluctuations in demand for QuidelOrtho’s non-\nrespiratory and respiratory products; supply chain, production, logistics, distribution and labor disruptions and challenges;the challenges and costs of integrating, restructuring and achieving anticipated\nsynergies as a result of the business combination of Quidel Corporation and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics Holdings plc; and other macroeconomic, geopolitical, market, business, competitive and/or\nregulatory factors affecting the business of QuidelOrtho generally, including those discussed in QuidelOrtho’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent\nreports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), including under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”ofthe Form 10-K. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as\npredictions of future events because these statements are based on assumptions that may not come true and are speculative by their nature. All forward-looking statements are based on information\ncurrently available to QuidelOrtho and speak only as of the date hereof. QuidelOrtho undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking information or time-sensitive information included in\nthis presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed expectations or otherwise, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: This presentation contains financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable rules and regulations of the Commission,\nincluding but not limited to \"constant currency revenue and revenue changes,\" \"recurring revenue and revenue changes, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue,\" \"recurring revenue\nand revenue changes, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue and one-time third-party collaboration settlement,\" “constant currency, recurring revenue and revenue changes, excluding\nCOVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue,\" “constant currency, recurring revenue and revenue changes, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue and one-time third-party\ncollaboration settlement,\" \"constant currency, Labs recurring revenue and revenue changes,\" \"non-GAAP operating expenses,\" \"adjusted diluted EPS,” \"adjusted diluted EPS growth,\" “adjusted\nEBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA margin,” \"adjusted free cash flow,\" \"adjusted gross profit,\" \"adjusted gross profit margin\" and other non-GAAP financial measures included in the reconciliation tables in the\nAppendix of this presentation. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for,financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures eliminate impacts of certain non-cash, unusual or other items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing\noperating performance, and the Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management’s financial andoperational decision-making, including evaluation of the\nCompany’s historical operating results and comparison to competitors’ operating results. The Company’s definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by\nothers. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that\nwill increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and reports filed with the\nCommission in their entirety. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the Appendix at the end of this presentation.\n© 2024.

A reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted dilutedEPS, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not provided because comparable GAAP measures for such\nmeasures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation. We are not, without unreasonable effort, able to reliably predict the impact of\nimpairment charges and related tax benefits, employee compensation costs and other adjustments. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and may have a material impact on our future GAAP results. In addition, the Company believes\nany such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors.

Statements\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of QuidelOrtho Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company” or\n“QuidelOrtho”) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and\nArticle 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete\nfinancial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation (consisting of normal\nrecurring accruals) have been included. Refer to the Summary of Abbreviated Terms at the end of this Quarterly Report for definitions of\nterms used throughout the document.\nThe information at September 29, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, is unaudited. For\nfurther information, refer to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2023 included in QuidelOrtho’s Annual Report. Operating results for any quarter are historically seasonal in nature and are not necessarily\nindicative of the results expected for the full year.\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year that ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December, and fiscal quarters\nthat end on the Sunday nearest to the end of the months of March, June and September. For 2024 and 2023, the Company’s fiscal year will\nend or has ended on December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For 2024 and 2023, the Company’s third quarter ended on\nSeptember 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively. The three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 each\nincluded 13 and 39 weeks, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior periods amounts to conform to the current period presentation. Such amounts include a\nreclassification of $2.2 million and $3.2 million recognized in the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively, related to\nimpairment of long-lived assets from (i) Cost of sales, excluding amortization of intangibles (excludes $1.3 million and $1.4 million for the\nthree and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively), and (ii) Research and development (excludes $0.9 million and $1.8 million for\nthe three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively), to Asset impairment charge.\nThe reclassifications did not have an impact on the Company’s previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements\nof Comprehensive Income (Loss), Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThere have been no accounting pronouncements issued or adopted during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 that are expected to\nhave a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 2. Computation of Earnings Per Share\nThe following table presents the calculation of the weighted-average shares used in computing basic and diluted EPS in the respective\nperiods:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 67.3 66.9 67.1 66.8\nDilutive potential shares issuable from stock options and RSUs (1) — — — —\nDiluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 67.3 66.9 67.1 66.8\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 11/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\n10\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 12/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\n(1) In the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, all potential shares of common stock issuable for stock options and RSUs\nwere excluded from the dilutive calculations above because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of potential\nshares of common stock issuable for stock options and RSUs on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding would have been\nas follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 67.3 66.9 67.1 66.8\nDilutive potential shares issuable from stock options and RSUs 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.5\nDiluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 67.5 67.3 67.4 67.3\nStock options and RSUs where the combined exercise price and unrecognized stock-based compensation was greater than the average\nmarket price for the Company’s common stock were not included in the computations of diluted weighted-average shares because the effect\nwould have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. These stock options and RSUs represented 1.9 million and 2.0 million shares\nof common stock for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and 1.7 million and 1.6 million shares of common\nstock for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively.\nNote 3. Revenue\nContract Balances\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an asset when revenue is recognized\nprior to invoicing a customer (a “contract asset”). Contract assets are included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the\nCompany’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and are transferred to accounts receivable when the right to payment becomes unconditional. The\nbalance of contract assets recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was\n$39.5 million and $46.2 million, respectively.\nThe contract asset balance consisted of the following components:\n• a customer supply agreement under which the difference between the timing of invoicing and revenue recognition resulted in a\ncontract asset of $1.9 million as of December 31, 2023. There was no contract asset remaining as of September 29, 2024;\n• contractual arrangements with certain customers under which the Company invoices the customers based on reportable results\ngenerated by its reagents; however, control of the goods transfers to the customers upon shipment or delivery of the products, as\ndetermined under the terms of the contract. Using the expected value method, the Company estimates the number of reagents that\nwill generate a reportable result. The Company records the revenue upon shipment and an associated contract asset, and relieves\nthe contract asset upon completion of the invoicing. The balance of the contract asset related to these arrangements was $39.5\nmillion and $41.8 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively; and\n• one of the Company’s contract manufacturing agreements that recognizes revenue as the products are manufactured resulted in a\ncontract asset of $2.5 million as of December 31, 2023. There was no contract asset remaining as of September 29, 2024.\nThe Company reviews contract assets for expected credit losses resulting from the collectability of customer accounts. Expected losses are\nestablished based on historical losses, customer mix and credit policies, current economic conditions in customers’ country or industry, and\nexpectations associated with reasonable and supportable forecasts. No credit losses related to contract assets were recognized during the\nthree and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023.\nThe Company recognizes a contract liability when a customer pays an invoice prior to the Company transferring control of the goods or\nservices (“contract liabilities”). The Company’s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue primarily related to customer service\ncontracts. The Company classifies deferred revenue as current or non-current based on the timing of the transfer of control or performance\nof the service. The balance of the Company’s current deferred revenue was $41.9 million and $36.8 million as of September 29, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively, and was included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has one\narrangement with a customer where the revenue is expected to be recognized beyond one year. The balance of the deferred revenue included\nin long-term liabilities was $17.4 million and $13.9 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was\nincluded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 that was recorded\nin Total revenues during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 was $4.8 million and $31.8 million, respectively.\n11\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 13/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nJoint Business with Grifols\nThe Company has an ongoing Joint Business between Ortho and Grifols, under which Ortho and Grifols agreed to pursue a collaboration\nrelating to Ortho’s Hepatitis and HIV diagnostics business. The governance of the Joint Business is shared through a supervisory board\nmade up of equal representation by Ortho and Grifols, which is responsible for all significant decisions relating to the Joint Business that are\nnot exclusively assigned to either Ortho or Grifols, as defined in the Joint Business agreement. The Company’s portion of the pre-tax net\nprofit shared under the Joint Business was $7.3 million and $24.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024,\nrespectively, and $8.9 million and $38.6 million during the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively. These amounts\nincluded the Company’s portion of the pre-tax net profit of $5.3 million and $16.8 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 29, 2024, respectively, and $7.3 million and $14.0 million during the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively,\non sales transactions with third parties where the Company is the principal. The Company recognized revenues, cost of sales, excluding\namortization of intangibles, and operating expenses, on a gross basis on these sales transactions in their respective lines in the Consolidated\nStatements of Loss. The Company’s portion of the pre-tax net profit also included revenue from collaboration and royalty agreements of\n$2.0 million and $7.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and $1.6 million and $24.6 million\nduring the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively, which is presented on a net basis within Total revenues.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table summarizes Total revenues by business unit:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nOctober 1, October 1,\n(In millions) September 29, 2024 2023 September 29, 2024 2023\nLabs $ 355.9 $ 341.4 $ 1,067.0 $ 1,073.5\nImmunohematology (1) 132.0 128.9 385.9 380.1\nDonor Screening (1) 28.0 35.0 95.7 103.0\nPoint of Care 205.6 233.1 509.3 675.4\nMolecular Diagnostics 5.6 5.6 17.2 23.2\nTotal revenues $ 727.1 $ 744.0 $ 2,075.1 $ 2,255.2\n(1) For presentation purposes, as a result of the wind-down of the U.S. donor screening portfolio, the previously reported Transfusion Medicine business\nunit is shown in its two product categories: Immunohematology and Donor Screening. Prior periods have been revised to align with the current period\npresentation.\nConcentration of Revenue and Credit Risk\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, one customer represented 11% of Total revenues. For the nine months ended October 1,\n2023, no customers individually accounted for more than 10% of Total revenues. Revenue related to the Company’s respiratory products\naccounted for 23% and 17% of Total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and 25% and 24% for\nthe three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively.\nAs of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, customers with a balance due in excess of 10% of Accounts receivable, net totaled $63.0\nmillion and $63.5 million, respectively.\nNote 4. Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company operates in three geographically-based reportable segments: North America, EMEA and China.\nEffective January 1, 2024, Japan and Asia Pacific operating segments were combined into one operating segment: JPAC. The CODM\nreviews the Company’s performance and allocates resources based on five operating segments: North America, EMEA, China, Latin\nAmerica and JPAC. North America, EMEA and China are the Company’s reportable segments; Latin America and JPAC are immaterial\noperating segments that are not considered reportable segments and are included in “Other.”\n12\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 14/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nTotal revenues by reportable segment are as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nOctober 1, October 1,\n(In millions) September 29, 2024 2023 September 29, 2024 2023\nNorth America $ 436.2 $ 465.2 $ 1,220.2 $ 1,426.8\nEMEA 84.0 74.5 249.9 236.4\nChina 80.4 81.1 238.1 233.0\nOther 126.5 123.2 366.9 359.0\nTotal revenues $ 727.1 $ 744.0 $ 2,075.1 $ 2,255.2\nThe following table sets forth Adjusted EBITDA by segment and the reconciliations to Loss before income taxes for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nOctober 1, October 1,\n(In millions) September 29, 2024 2023 September 29, 2024 2023\nNorth America $ 233.0 $ 253.4 $ 625.7 $ 708.1\nEMEA 6.7 10.2 30.9 22.7\nChina 36.9 37.3 97.4 96.0\nOther 31.7 31.2 97.8 89.3\nTotal segment Adjusted EBITDA 308.3 332.1 851.8 916.1\nCorporate (1) (137.6) (162.9) (459.2) (388.3)\nDepreciation and amortization (113.1) (113.1) (344.1) (341.8)\nInterest expense, net (42.9) (37.7) (122.9) (110.9)\nIntegration related costs (36.8) (26.5) (90.3) (80.4)\nGoodwill impairment charge — — (1,743.9) —\nAsset impairment charge — (2.2) (56.9) (3.2)\nAmortization of deferred cloud computing implementation costs (4.7) (2.8) (10.6) (5.9)\nEU medical device regulation transition costs (2) (0.4) (0.4) (1.5) (1.9)\nLoss on investments — (1.0) — (1.2)\nEmployee compensation charges — — (5.6) —\nCredit Agreement amendment fees — — (4.0) —\nTax indemnification income — 0.1 — 0.2\nOther adjustments (1.6) (1.1) (3.4) (2.6)\nLoss before income taxes $ (28.8) $ (15.5) $ (1,990.6) $ (19.9)\n(1) Primarily consists of costs related to executive and staff functions, including certain finance, human resources, manufacturing and IT functions, which\nbenefit the Company as a whole.

Income Taxes\nThe Company calculates its interim income tax provision in accordance with ASC 270, Interim Reporting, and ASC 740, Accounting for\nIncome Taxes. At the end of each interim period, the Company estimates its annual effective tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary\nquarterly earnings to calculate the tax related to ordinary income. The tax effects for other items that are excluded from ordinary income are\ndiscretely calculated and recognized in the period in which they occur.\nFor the three months ended September 29, 2024, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $8.9 million in relation to loss before\nincome taxes of $28.8 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.9%. For the three months ended October 1, 2023, the Company\nrecognized an income tax benefit of $2.8 million in relation to loss before income taxes of $15.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of\n18.1%. For the three months ended September 29, 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to\nthe utilization of net operating losses previously not benefited due to valuation allowances. For the three months ended October 1, 2023, the\neffective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to net operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited\ndue to the establishment of valuation allowances and Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, partially offset by non-U.S. earnings being taxed\nat rates that were different than the U.S. statutory rate, R&D credits, foreign tax credits and foreign exchange losses.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $117.0 million in relation to loss before\nincome taxes of $1,990.6 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 5.9%. For the nine months ended October 1, 2023, the Company\nrecognized an income tax benefit of $2.8 million in relation to loss before income taxes of $19.9 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of\n14.1%. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to\ngoodwill impairment charges that were nondeductible for tax purposes. For the nine months ended October 1, 2023, the effective tax rate\ndiffered from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to net operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the\nestablishment of valuation allowances and Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, partially offset by non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that\nwere different than the U.S. statutory rate, R&D credits, foreign tax credits and foreign exchange losses.\nThe balance of unrecognized tax benefits at September 29, 2024, not including interest and penalties, was $30.1 million, of which $22.6\nmillion could affect the effective income tax rate in future periods, if recognized. The Company also recognizes interest and penalties related\nto unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. At September 29, 2024, the Company had approximately $4.5 million of interest and penalties\naccrued related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company estimates that within the next 12 months, its uncertain tax positions, excluding\ninterest, should decrease by $11.7 million.\nThe Company is subject to periodic audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Due to the carryforward of unutilized credits, the\nCompany’s federal tax years from 2012 and onwards are subject to examination by the U.S. authorities. The Company’s state and foreign\ntax years for 2001 and onwards are subject to examination by applicable tax authorities. The Company believes that it has appropriate\nsupport for the income tax positions taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an\nassessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.\nIndemnification Assets\nOrtho is currently under audit in certain jurisdictions for tax years under the responsibility of Johnson & Johnson. Pursuant to the stock and\nasset purchase agreement entered into by Ortho and Johnson & Johnson in January 2014, Johnson & Johnson retained all income tax\nliabilities accrued as of the date of acquisition, including reserves for unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, all tax liabilities related to\nthese tax years are required to be indemnified by Johnson & Johnson. The indemnification receivable from Johnson & Johnson totaled $3.1\nmillion and $3.0 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included as a component of Prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNote 6.

Assets Held for Sale\nThe following criteria are considered before concluding assets are classified as held for sale: 1) management’s commitment to a plan to sell,\n2) availability for immediate sale in its present condition, 3) initiation of an active program to identify a buyer, 4) probability of a completed\nsale within one year, 5) actively marketed for sale at a reasonable price in relation to its current fair value, and 6) likelihood of significant\nchanges to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. If all of the criteria are met as of the balance sheet date, the net assets\nare presented separately in the balance sheet as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and is no\nlonger depreciated or amortized while classified as held for sale. The Company assesses the fair value of a long-lived asset less any costs to\nsell at each reporting period and until the asset is no longer classified as held for sale.\nAs part of the Company’s cost-savings initiatives, the Company has been evaluating its real estate footprint with the goal to relocate and\nconsolidate its operations to improve long-term results. As a result, the Company has decided to (i) sell the McKellar, San Diego, CA facility\nand (ii) sell the Raritan, NJ facility with the intent to subsequently lease back the right to use the property. In the second quarter of 2024, the\nproperties met the requirements for reclassification from property, plant and equipment, net to assets held for sale when it became probable\nthat the properties would be sold within one year. The carrying value of the assets was reduced to its estimated relative fair value less costs\nto sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $56.9 million that was included in Asset impairment charge.\nNote 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\nChanges in goodwill were as follows:\n(In millions) North America EMEA China Other Total\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 1,743.9 $ 582.4 $ 85.7 $ 80.0 $ 2,492.0\nImpairment charge (1,743.9) — — — (1,743.9)\nForeign currency translation — 21.8 1.6 (0.9) 22.5\nBalance at September 29, 2024 $ — $ 604.2 $ 87.3 $ 79.1 $ 770.6\n16\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 18/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter and monitors throughout the year for\nimpairment triggering events that indicate that the carrying value of one or more of its reporting units exceeds its fair value.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company concluded that (i) the sustained decline in the Company’s stock price and market\ncapitalization that occurred during the first quarter of 2024, (ii) the faster than expected decline in COVID-19 and flu markets, and (iii) the\ndelay in the timing of expected commercialization for Savanna were triggering events requiring an interim goodwill impairment assessment\nfor all reporting units.\nBased on the Company’s interim goodwill impairment assessment in the first quarter of 2024, the Company concluded that the North\nAmerica reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill\nimpairment charge of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024 for the North America reporting unit, which represented a full impairment of\nthe goodwill allocated to the North America reporting unit. The decline in the estimated fair value of the North America reporting unit and\nthe resulting impairment were primarily driven by revised short-term and mid-term forecasts for revenue and EBITDA expectations in North\nAmerica.\nThe estimated fair values of the EMEA, Latin America and JPAC reporting units as of the interim testing date exceeded their respective\ncarrying values. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective\nreporting unit) ranged from approximately 30% to 150%. Due to the significant excess of fair value over carrying value of these reporting\nunits, they are less sensitive to changes in forecast assumptions. To evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the interim\ngoodwill impairment test for the EMEA, Latin America and JPAC reporting units, the Company applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the\nfair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical\n5% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective\nreporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 25% to 140%.\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units consisted of a fair value calculation that combines an income\napproach, using a discounted cash flow method, and a market approach, using the guideline public company method. The quantitative\ngoodwill impairment assessment requires the application of a number of significant assumptions, including estimates of future revenue\ngrowth rates, EBITDA margins, discount rates and market multiples. The projected future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, and\nthe resulting projected cash flows are based on historical experience and internal annual operating plans reviewed by management,\nextrapolated over the forecast period. Discount rates are determined using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk factors\nspecific to the reporting units. Market multiples are based on the guideline public company method using comparable publicly traded\ncompany multiples of revenue and EBITDA for a group of benchmark companies.\nThe Company believes the assumptions that were used in the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment are reasonable and consistent\nwith assumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants.\nThe Company also reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthe carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. Given the indications of possible impairment that occurred during the first\nquarter of 2024, the Company tested its North America long-lived asset group for recoverability and impairment as of March 31, 2024.\nRecoverability of long-lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash\nflows expected to be generated by the asset group. The undiscounted cash flows for the North America long-lived asset group were above\nthe carrying value and the Company determined that the long-lived asset group was recoverable, and no impairment existed as of March 31,\n2024. Subsequent to the first quarter of 2024, no impairment indicators were noted.\n17\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 19/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nNote 9. Borrowings\nThe components of borrowings were as follows:\n(In millions) September 29, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTerm Loan $ 2,317.1 $ 2,420.2\nRevolving Credit Facility 230.0 —\nFinancing lease obligation 9.3 0.4\nOther short-term borrowings — 1.6\nOther long-term borrowings 0.1 0.4\nUnamortized deferred financing costs (6.1) (8.0)\nTotal borrowings 2,550.4 2,414.6\nLess: current portion (373.8) (139.8)\nLong-term borrowings $ 2,176.6 $ 2,274.8\nThe Credit Agreement, dated May 27, 2022, by and among the Company, as borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and\nswing line lender, and the other lenders and L/C issuers party thereto consists of a $2,750.0 million Term Loan and an $800.0 million\nRevolving Credit Facility. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, after deducting letters of credit of $13.0 million and $230.0\nmillion borrowings outstanding, was $557.0 million as of September 29, 2024. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the\nCompany made $103.1 million in payments on the Term Loan.\nThe Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for credit agreements of this nature. The negative\ncovenants include, among other things, limitations on asset sales, mergers, indebtedness, liens, investments and transactions with affiliates.\nOn April 25, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Amendment”), by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto,\nand Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, which amends the Credit Agreement. The Amendment sets a maximum Consolidated\nLeverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the applicable measurement period as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of (a)\n4.50 to 1.00 on or prior to June 30, 2023, (b) 4.00 to 1.00 after June 30, 2023 and on or prior to June 30, 2024, (c) 4.25 to 1.00 after June 30,\n2024 and on or prior to December 31, 2024, (d) 4.00 to 1.00 after December 31, 2024 and on or prior to June 30, 2025 and (e) 3.75 to 1.00\neach fiscal quarter after June 30, 2025. The Credit Agreement contains a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the\nCredit Agreement) of 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters. The Company was\nin compliance with the financial covenants as of September 29, 2024.\nThe following table provides the detailed amounts within Interest expense, net for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and\nOctober 1, 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nOctober 1, October 1,\n(In millions) September 29, 2024 2023 September 29, 2024 2023\nTerm Loan $ 43.9 $ 45.7 $ 132.8 $ 130.8\nRevolving Credit Facility 5.6 0.9 10.8 1.9\nAmortization of deferred financing costs 0.8 0.9 2.4 2.5\nDerivative instruments and other (7.0) (8.5) (21.3) (20.2)\nInterest income (0.4) (1.3) (1.8) (4.1)\nInterest expense, net $ 42.9 $ 37.7 $ 122.9 $ 110.9\n18\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 20/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nNote 10.

Amounts related to the three and nine\nmonths ended September 29, 2024 were not material.\nNote 11. Commitments and Contingencies\nOn April 12, 2024, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action complaint under the federal securities laws against\nthe Company and three of its current and former executives. The complaint, which is captioned Bristol County Retirement System v.\nQuidelOrtho Corporation, et al., Case No. 1:24-cv-02804-MKV (S.D.N.Y.) (the “Bristol County Complaint”), asserts claims for violations\nof Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder related to statements regarding sales of the\nCompany’s COVID-19 diagnostic tests and the 510(k) submission for its Savanna RVP4 assay. The Bristol County Complaint seeks a\njudgment determining that the lawsuit can be maintained as a class action and awarding the plaintiff and putative class damages, pre- and\npost-judgment interest, attorneys’ and experts’ fees, and costs.\nOn April 25, 2024, and June 21, 2024, two purported stockholders of the Company filed separate stockholder derivative complaints,\npurportedly on behalf of the Company, against the current and certain former members of the Company’s Board of Directors and three of its\ncurrent and former executives. The complaints, which are captioned Matthew Whitfield v. Kenneth F. Buechler, Ph.D., et al., Case No. 1:24-\ncv-03176-MKV (S.D.N.Y.) (the “Whitfield Complaint”), and Steven Pinkney v. Douglas Bryant, et al., Case No. 1:24-cv-4753-MKV\n(S.D.N.Y.) (the “Pinkney Complaint”), assert claims for violations of Sections 10(b), 14(a), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5\nand 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of\ncontrol, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets related to statements regarding sales of the Company’s COVID-19 diagnostic\ntests and the 510(k) submission for its Savanna RVP4 assay. The Whitfield and Pinkney Complaints seek judgments awarding compensatory\nand punitive damages against the individual defendants, directing an accounting by the individual defendants, directing the Company and\nthe individual defendants to take actions to improve the Company’s governance and procedures, and awarding the costs and disbursements\nof the action, including attorneys’ fees, accountants’ and experts’ fees, costs, and expenses.\nThe Company disputes the allegations of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Nevertheless, the outcomes of\nthese lawsuits are uncertain and cannot be predicted with any certainty. Accordingly, at this time, the Company is not able to estimate a\npossible loss or range of loss that may result from these lawsuits or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse\neffect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in other litigation and legal proceedings, including matters related to product liability claims,\ncommercial disputes and intellectual property claims, as well as regulatory, employment, and other claims related to its business. The\nCompany accrues for legal claims when, and to the extent that, amounts associated with the claims become probable and are reasonably\nestimable. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any\nother, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required\nto estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from these matters are inherently difficult\nto predict. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those claims. For\nthose matters as to which the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss, the Company is not able to determine whether\nthe loss will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nManagement believes that all such current legal actions, in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany. However, the resolution of, or increase in any accruals for, one or more matters may have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s results of operations and cash flows.\n19\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 21/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nNote 12. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents the Company’s hierarchy for its assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the\nfollowing periods:\nSeptember 29, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nMarketable securities $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 55.8 $ — $ 55.8\nDerivative assets — 10.3 — 10.3 — 6.9 — 6.9\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ — $ 10.3 $ — $ 10.3 $ — $ 62.7 $ — $ 62.7\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities $ — $ 47.1 $ — $ 47.1 $ — $ 27.5 $ — $ 27.5\nContingent consideration — — — — — — 0.1 0.1\nTotal liabilities measured at fair\nvalue $ — $ 47.1 $ — $ 47.1 $ — $ 27.5 $ 0.1 $ 27.6\nThere were no transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 29,\n2024 and fiscal year 2023.\nMarketable securities consist of investment-grade corporate and government debt securities, corporate asset-backed securities and\ncommercial paper. Derivative financial instruments are based on observable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Observable inputs\ninclude broker quotes, daily market foreign currency rates and forward pricing curves.\nFinancial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value\nThe estimated fair value of the Company’s borrowings under the Term Loan was $2,293.9 million at September 29, 2024, compared to the\ncarrying amount, excluding debt issuance costs, of $2,317.1 million. The estimated fair value of the Company’s borrowings under the Term\nLoan was $2,396.0 million at December 31, 2023, compared to the carrying amount, excluding debt issuance costs, of $2,420.2 million. The\nestimate of fair value is generally based on the quoted market prices for similar issuances of long-term debt with the same maturities, which\nis classified as a Level 2 input.\nNote 13. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company selectively uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage market risk associated with changes in interest rates and\nforeign currency exchange rates. The use of derivatives is intended for hedging purposes only, and the Company does not enter into\nderivative transactions for speculative purposes.\nCredit risk represents the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled\nif all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements\nthat reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. The Company does not have any derivative\ninstruments with credit-risk related contingent features that would require it to post collateral.\nInterest Rate Hedging Instruments\nThe Company’s interest rate risk relates primarily to interest rate exposures on variable rate debt, including the Revolving Credit Facility\nand Term Loan. Refer to “—Note 9. Borrowings” for additional information on the currently outstanding components of the Revolving\nCredit Facility and Term Loan. The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the related risk of the variability to the\nCompany’s cash flows due to the rates specified for these credit facilities.\nThe Company designates its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. The Company records gains and losses due to changes in fair value of\nthe derivatives within OCI and reclassifies these amounts to Interest expense, net in the same period or periods for which the underlying\nhedged transaction affects earnings. In the event the Company determines the hedged transaction is no longer probable to occur or concludes\nthe hedge relationship is no longer effective, the hedge is prospectively de-designated. Pre-tax unrealized loss of $1.3 million as of\nSeptember 29, 2024 is expected to be reclassified from OCI to earnings in the next 12 months.\n20\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 22/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s interest rate derivative agreements as of September 29, 2024, all of which were interest rate\nswaps:\nNotional Amount\n(In millions) Description Hedge Designation Effective Date Expiration Date\n$ 550.0 Pay 3.765% fixed, receive floating rate Designated cash December 30, 2022 May 27, 2027\n(1-month USD-SOFR) flow hedge\n$ 200.0 Pay 3.7725% fixed, receive floating rate Designated cash December 30, 2022 May 27, 2027\n(1-month USD-SOFR) flow hedge\n$ 300.0 Pay 3.7675% fixed, receive floating rate Designated cash December 30, 2022 May 27, 2027\n(1-month USD-SOFR) flow hedge\n$ 400.0 Pay 3.7575% fixed, receive floating rate Designated cash December 30, 2022 May 27, 2027\n(1-month USD-SOFR) flow hedge\n$ 350.0 Pay 3.7725% fixed, receive floating rate Designated cash December 30, 2022 May 27, 2027\n(1-month USD-SOFR) flow hedge\nCurrency Hedging Instruments\nThe Company has currency risk exposures relating primarily to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted\nforeign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and may\nuse option contracts and cross currency swaps to manage its currency risk exposures. The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts are\ndenominated primarily in Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chilean Peso, Chinese Yuan/Renminbi,\nColombian Peso, Czech Koruna, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Mexican Peso, Philippine Peso, South Korean Won, Swiss Franc and\nThai Baht.\nThe Company designates certain foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges. The Company records gains and losses due to\nchanges in fair value of the derivatives within OCI and reclassifies these amounts to Total revenues and Cost of sales, excluding\namortization of intangibles in the same period or periods for which the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. In the event the\nCompany determines the hedged transaction is no longer probable to occur or concludes the hedge relationship is no longer effective, the\nhedge is prospectively de-designated. Pre-tax unrealized gains of $2.2 million as of September 29, 2024 is expected to be reclassified from\nOCI to earnings in the next 12 months.\nThe Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not part of designated hedging relationships and which are\nintended to mitigate exchange rate risk of monetary assets and liabilities and related forecasted transactions. The Company records these\nnon-designated derivatives at mark-to-market with gains and losses recognized in earnings within Other expense, net.\nThe following table provides details of the currency hedging instruments outstanding as of September 29, 2024:\nNotional Amount\nDescription (In millions) Hedge Designation\nForeign currency forward contracts $ 188.7 Cash Flow Hedge\nForeign currency forward contracts $ 833.6 Non-designated\n21\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 23/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nThe following table summarizes pre-tax gains and losses from designated derivative and non-derivative instruments within AOCI for the\nthree and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023:\nDesignated Hedging Instruments\nAmount of Loss (Gain) Recognized Location of Amounts Reclassified Amount of Loss (Gain) Reclassified\n(In millions) in OCI on Hedges from AOCI into Income from AOCI into Income\nThree Months Ended September 29, 2024\nForeign currency forward contracts\n(sales) $ 3.2 Total revenues $ —\nForeign currency forward contracts Cost of sales, excluding\n(purchases) $ (0.1) amortization of intangibles $ 0.3\nInterest rate derivatives $ 41.7 Interest expense, net $ (7.1)\nNine Months Ended September 29, 2024\nForeign currency forward contracts\n(sales) $ (2.8) Total revenues $ 2.1\nForeign currency forward contracts Cost of sales, excluding\n(purchases) $ 0.7 amortization of intangibles $ 0.3\nInterest rate derivatives $ (4.1) Interest expense, net $ (21.3)\nThree Months Ended October 1, 2023\nForeign currency forward contracts\n(sales) $ (1.0) Total revenues $ 1.8\nForeign currency forward contracts Cost of sales, excluding\n(purchases) $ (0.1) amortization of intangibles $ 0.4\nInterest rate derivatives $ (28.0) Interest expense, net $ (8.5)\nNine Months Ended October 1, 2023\nForeign currency forward contracts\n(sales) $ 0.7 Total revenues $ 2.7\nForeign currency forward contracts Cost of sales, excluding\n(purchases) $ (2.2) amortization of intangibles $ 2.1\nInterest rate derivatives $ (54.1) Interest expense, net $ (21.1)\nThe Company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against movements in\nexchange rates. The forward exchange contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in foreign operations. The unrealized gains\nor losses on these contracts are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments within OCI, and remain in AOCI until either the sale or\ncomplete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. The Company excludes certain portions of the change in fair value of its\nderivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded components). Changes in fair value of the excluded\ncomponents are recognized in OCI. The Company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the excluded components on a straight-line\nbasis over the life of the derivative instrument.\nThe effect of the Company’s net investment hedges on OCI and the Consolidated Statements of Loss are shown below:\nNet Investment Hedging Relationships\nAmount of Pre-tax (Gain) Loss Recognized in\nOther Expense, Net for Amounts Excluded from\n(In millions) Amount of Pre-tax Loss (Gain) Recognized in OCI Effectiveness Testing\nThree Months Ended September 29, 2024\nForeign exchange contracts $ 20.2 $ (3.3)\nNine Months Ended September 29, 2024\nForeign exchange contracts $ 1.9 $ (8.2)\nFair value gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts, as determined using Level 2 inputs, that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting treatment are recorded in Other expense, net.

Our global\ninfrastructure and commercial reach support our customers across more than 130 countries and territories with quality diagnostics, a broad\ntest portfolio and market-leading service. We operate globally with manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and U.K. and with sales centers,\nadministrative offices and warehouses located throughout the world.\nWe manage our business geographically to better align with the market dynamics of the specific geographic regions in which we operate,\nwith our reportable segments being North America, EMEA and China. Latin America and JPAC (Japan and Asia Pacific) are immaterial\noperating segments that are not considered reportable segments and are included in “Other.” We generate our revenue in the following\nbusiness units: Labs, Immunohematology, Donor Screening, Point of Care and Molecular Diagnostics.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, Total revenues decreased by 8% to $2,075.1 million as compared to the same period in the\nprior year, primarily driven by variability of our U.S. respiratory products. Currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 100 basis\npoints on our growth rate. Our revenues can be highly concentrated over a small number of products, including certain of our respiratory\nproducts. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, revenues related to our respiratory products accounted for\napproximately 17% and 24% of our Total revenues, respectively.\n25\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 27/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nPlanned Wind-Down of U.S. Donor Screening Portfolio\nIn February 2024, we initiated a wind-down plan to transition out of the U.S. donor screening portfolio. Specifically, we plan to wind-down\nonly the ORTHO VERSEIA® Integrated Processor platform and microplate assays, which are only sold in the U.S., and have a lower\ngrowth and margin profile. This wind-down will not affect any donor screening portfolio outside of the U.S. While our goal is to wind-down\nthis U.S. donor screening portfolio, we will continue to support our existing customers and honor our contractual commitments. The\nwinding down of the U.S. donor screening portfolio, as compared to the prior year periods, contributed to the decline in revenue with a\nmargin lower than our overall margin. Refer to Item 1, “Financial Statements—Note 3. Revenue” for more information. The wind-down of\nour U.S. donor screening portfolio is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2025.\nOutlook\nOur financial performance and results of operations will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain,\ncontinuously evolving and unpredictable, including the occurrence, spread, severity, duration and emergence of new variants of respiratory\ndiseases, including flu, strep, RSV and COVID-19, as well as ongoing supply, production and logistics challenges.\nWe expect overall demand for our non-respiratory and respiratory products to continue to fluctuate and pricing pressures on certain products\nto persist as a result of a number of factors, including increased supply, emergence and spread of new variants, and the seasonal demands of\nthe respiratory season, which are typically more prevalent during the fall and winter.\nBecause our business environment is highly competitive, our long-term growth and profitability will depend in part on our ability to retain\nand grow our current customers and attract new customers through developing and delivering new and improved products and services that\nmeet our customers’ needs and expectations, including with respect to product performance, product offerings, cost, automation and other\nwork-flow efficiencies. As a result, we expect to continue to maintain our emphasis on R&D investments for longer term growth, including\nfor our next generation platforms and assays, as well as additional assays to be launched on our current platforms. In addition, we expect to\ncontinue to evaluate strategic opportunities to (i) expand our product lines and services, production capabilities, technologies and\ngeographic footprint and address other business challenges and opportunities, and (ii) rationalize and consolidate facilities with the goal to\nimprove our long-term results.\nWhile we expect the revenues and financial results from our non-respiratory and respiratory products to be affected by the highly\ncompetitive environment and our respiratory products to be affected by the seasonal demands of the respiratory season, we intend to\ncontinue our focus on prudently managing our business and delivering improved financial results, while at the same time striving to\nintroduce new products and services into the market.\nSeasonality\nRevenues from our respiratory products are subject to, and significantly affected by, the seasonal demands of the cold, flu and RSV seasons,\nwhich are typically more prevalent during the fall and winter. Historically, revenues from our influenza products have varied from year to\nyear based, in large part, on the severity, length and timing of the onset of the cold, flu and RSV seasons. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 virus\nmay have similar seasonal demands and impacts on our revenues in the future.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nThe following table compares Total revenues by business unit for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1,\n2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nOctober 1, October 1,\n(Dollars in millions) September 29, 2024 2023 % Change September 29, 2024 2023 % Change\nLabs $ 355.9 $ 341.4 4 % $ 1,067.0 $ 1,073.5 (1)%\nImmunohematology (1) 132.0 128.9 2 % 385.9 380.1 2 %\nDonor Screening (1) 28.0 35.0 (20)% 95.7 103.0 (7)%\nPoint of Care 205.6 233.1 (12)% 509.3 675.4 (25)%\nMolecular Diagnostics 5.6 5.6 — % 17.2 23.2 (26)%\nTotal revenues $ 727.1 $ 744.0 (2)% $ 2,075.1 $ 2,255.2 (8)%\n26\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 28/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 29/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\n(1) For presentation purposes, as a result of the wind-down of the U.S. donor screening portfolio, the previously reported Transfusion Medicine business\nunit is shown in its two product categories: Immunohematology and Donor Screening. Prior periods have been revised to align with the current period\npresentation.\nFor the three months ended September 29, 2024, Total revenues decreased to $727.1 million from $744.0 million for the same period in the\nprior year. Labs revenue increased 4% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to growth in recurring revenue, which includes\nreagents, consumables and services in our Labs revenue, partially offset by a decline in instrument revenue. Excluding foreign currency\nimpact, Labs revenue increased 5% compared to the prior year period. Immunohematology revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year\nperiod, primarily due to reagent growth. Donor Screening revenue decreased 20% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the\nwind-down of the U.S. donor screening business. Point of Care revenue decreased 12% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to\nlower sales of Sofia SARS Antigen assays, partially offset by an increase in demand for QuickVue SARS Antigen assays. Currency\nexchange rates did not significantly impact our growth rate for the three months ended September 29, 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, Total revenues decreased to $2,075.1 million from $2,255.2 million for the same period in\nthe prior year. Labs revenue decreased 1% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a $19.2 million settlement award from a third\nparty related to one of our collaboration agreements in the prior year period, partially offset by growth in recurring revenue.\nImmunohematology revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to reagent growth. Donor Screening revenue\ndecreased 7% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the wind-down of the U.S. donor screening business. The Point of Care\nbusiness unit contributed to revenue decline, driven by a decrease of $178.9 million in sales of QuickVue SARS Antigen assays, primarily\ndue to a COVID-19 government award in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase of $11.8 million in sales of Sofia SARS\nAntigen assays. Molecular Diagnostics sales decreased by $6.0 million, driven primarily by lower demand. Currency exchange rates had an\nunfavorable impact of approximately 100 basis points on our growth rate for the nine months ended September 29, 2024.\nCost of Sales, Excluding Amortization of Intangible Assets\nCost of sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, increased to $374.8 million, or 51.5% of Total revenues, for the three months\nended September 29, 2024, compared to $374.6 million, or 50.3% of Total revenues, for the three months ended October 1, 2023. Cost of\nsales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, was impacted by a shift in product mix.\nCost of sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, decreased to $1,114.7 million, or 53.7% of Total revenues, for the nine months\nended September 29, 2024, compared to $1,140.7 million, or 50.6% of Total revenues, for the nine months ended October 1, 2023. The\ndecrease in cost of sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, was driven primarily by a prior year period COVID-19 government\naward, along with the corresponding inventory release of $39 million, partially offset by an increase in sales of Sofia SARS Antigen assays.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table summarizes operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n% of % of % of % of\nSeptember 29, Total October 1, Total September 29, Total October 1, Total\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 Revenues 2023 Revenues 2024 Revenues 2023 Revenues\nSelling, marketing and\nadministrative $ 186.4 25.6 % $ 194.1 26.1 % $ 579.3 27.9 % $ 575.6 25.5 %\nResearch and development 55.9 7.7 % 61.5 8.3 % 171.4 8.3 % 185.7 8.2 %\nAmortization of intangible\nassets 51.9 7.1 % 51.4 6.9 % 155.5 7.5 % 153.6 6.8 %\nIntegration related costs 36.8 5.1 % 26.5 3.6 % 90.3 4.4 % 80.4 3.6 %\nGoodwill impairment charge — N/M — N/M 1,743.9 N/M — N/M\nAsset impairment charge — N/M 2.2 N/M 56.9 N/M 3.2 N/M\nOther operating expenses 6.3 0.9 % 7.4 1.0 % 23.6 1.1 % 17.0 0.8 %\n* N/M - Not meaningful\nSelling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, marketing and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 29, 2024 decreased by $7.7 million, or 4.0%, to\n$186.4 million from $194.1 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower employee compensation costs.\n27\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 30/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nSelling, marketing and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 increased by $3.7 million, or 0.6%, to $579.3\nmillion from $575.6 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher employee compensation costs.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense for the three months ended September 29, 2024 decreased by $5.6 million, or 9.1%, to $55.9 million\nfrom $61.5 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower outside services and employee compensation costs.\nResearch and development expense for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 decreased by $14.3 million, or 7.7%, to $171.4 million\nfrom $185.7 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower employee compensation costs and outside services.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $51.9 million and $155.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024,\nrespectively, and $51.4 million and $153.6 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively.\nIntegration Related Costs\nIntegration related costs were $36.8 million and $90.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and\n$26.5 million and $80.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively. The increase in costs compared to the\nprior year periods was primarily due to consulting costs and employee compensation related charges.\nGoodwill Impairment Charge\nDuring the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we identified a triggering event requiring an interim goodwill impairment assessment\nfor our reporting units. As a result, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.7 billion for the North America reporting\nunit. Refer to Item 1, “Financial Statements—Note 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” for more information.\nAsset Impairment Charge\nDuring the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of $56.9 million related to the long-lived assets\nclassified as assets held for sale. Refer to Item 1, “Financial Statements—Note 7. Assets Held for Sale” for more information. Asset\nimpairment charges were $2.2 million and $3.2 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses were $6.3 million and $23.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and\n$7.4 million and $17.0 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively. Other operating expenses were primarily\nrelated to the profit share expense for our Joint Business with Grifols.\nNon-operating Expenses\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net was $42.9 million and $122.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and $37.7\nmillion and $110.9 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively. Refer to Item 1, “Financial Statements—Note\n9. Borrowings” for more information.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net was $0.9 million and $7.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and\n$4.1 million and $8.0 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively. The decreases from prior year periods were\nprimarily related to net foreign currency losses offset by the Credit Agreement amendment fees. Refer to Item 1, “Financial Statements—\nNote 9. Borrowings” for more information.\n28\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 31/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nIncome Taxes\nFor the three months ended September 29, 2024, we recognized an income tax benefit of $8.9 million in relation to loss before income taxes\nof $28.8 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.9%. For the three months ended October 1, 2023, we recognized an income tax\nbenefit of $2.8 million in relation to loss before income taxes of $15.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 18.1%. For the three\nmonths ended September 29, 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of net\noperating losses previously not benefited due to valuation allowances. For the three months ended October 1, 2023, the effective tax rate\ndiffered from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to net operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the\nestablishment of valuation allowances and Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, partially offset by non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that\nwere different than the U.S. statutory rate, R&D credits, foreign tax credits and foreign exchange losses.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we recognized an income tax benefit of $117.0 million in relation to loss before income\ntaxes of $1,990.6 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 5.9%. For the nine months ended October 1, 2023, we recognized an income\ntax benefit of $2.8 million in relation to loss before income taxes of $19.9 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 14.1%. For the nine\nmonths ended September 29, 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to goodwill impairment\ncharges that were nondeductible for tax purposes. For the nine months ended October 1, 2023, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S.\nfederal statutory rate primarily due to net operating losses in certain subsidiaries not being benefited due to the establishment of valuation\nallowances and Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, partially offset by non-U.S. earnings being taxed at rates that were different than the\nU.S. statutory rate, R&D credits, foreign tax credits and foreign exchange losses.\nSegment Results\nWe operate under three geographically-based reportable segments: North America, EMEA and China. Our operations in Latin America and\nJPAC (Japan and Asia Pacific) are immaterial operating segments that are not considered reportable segments and are included in “Other.”\nThe key indicators that we monitor are as follows:\n• Total revenues — This measure is discussed in the section entitled “Results of Operations.”\n• Adjusted EBITDA — Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segment is used by our management to measure and evaluate the internal\noperating performance of our reportable segments. It is also the basis for calculating certain management incentive compensation\nprograms. We believe that this measurement is useful to investors as a way to analyze the underlying trends in our core business,\nincluding at the segment level, consistently across the periods presented and to evaluate performance under management incentive\ncompensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA consists of Net loss before Interest expense, net, Benefit from income taxes and\ndepreciation and amortization and eliminates (i) certain non-operating income or expense items, and (ii) impacts of certain non-\ncash, unusual or other items that are included in Net loss and that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating\nperformance. Refer to Item 1, “Financial Statements—Note 4. Segment and Geographic Information” for a reconciliation of\nAdjusted EBITDA by reportable segment to Loss before income taxes.\nNorth America\nTotal revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for North America were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nTotal revenues $ 436.2 $ 465.2 (6)% $ 1,220.2 $ 1,426.8 (14)%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 233.0 $ 253.4 (8)% $ 625.7 $ 708.1 (12)%\nTotal revenues were $436.2 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to $465.2 million for the three months ended\nOctober 1, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower revenues for Sofia SARS Antigen assays and the wind-down of the U.S. donor\nscreening business, partially offset by higher demand for QuickVue SARS Antigen assays.\nTotal revenues were $1,220.2 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to $1,426.8 million for the nine months\nended October 1, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a COVID-19 government award in the prior year period and the wind-down\nof the U.S. donor screening business, partially offset by an increase in revenues for Sofia SARS Antigen assays.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $233.0 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to $253.4 million for the three months\nended October 1, 2023.

Our cash\nrequirements fluctuate as a result of numerous factors, including cash generated from operations, progress in R&D, capital expansion\nprojects and acquisition and business development activities. We believe our organizational structure allows us the necessary flexibility to\nmove funds throughout our subsidiaries to meet our operational working capital needs.\nDebt Capitalization\nOur Credit Agreement consists of a $2,750.0 million Term Loan and an $800.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Availability under the\nRevolving Credit Facility, after deducting letters of credit of $13.0 million and $230.0 million borrowings outstanding, was $557.0 million\nas of September 29, 2024.\nOn April 25, 2024, we entered into the Amendment, by and among us, the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as\nadministrative agent, which amended the Credit Agreement. The Amendment sets a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in\nthe Credit Agreement) for the applicable measurement period as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of (a) 4.50 to 1.00 on or prior to June\n30, 2023, (b) 4.00 to 1.00 after June 30, 2023 and on or prior to June 30, 2024, (c) 4.25 to 1.00 after June 30, 2024 and on or prior to\nDecember 31, 2024, (d) 4.00 to 1.00 after December 31, 2024 and on or prior to June 30, 2025 and (e) 3.75 to 1.00 each fiscal quarter after\nJune 30, 2025. The Credit Agreement contains a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of\n3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters. We were in compliance with the financial\ncovenants as of September 29, 2024.\n31\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 34/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures, including investments, were $147.9 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024. We continue to make\ncapital expenditures in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and other facility-related activities.\nCash Flow Summary\nNine Months Ended\nOctober 1,\n(In millions) September 29, 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 19.3 $ 199.8\nNet cash used for investing activities (112.0) (132.5)\nNet cash provided by (used for) financing activities 117.7 (208.0)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash (0.5) (3.3)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 24.5 $ (144.0)\nNine Months Ended September 29, 2024\nCash provided by operating activities was $19.3 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, and reflected a net loss of $1,873.6\nmillion and non-cash adjustments of $2,099.8 million, primarily associated with a goodwill impairment charge and change in deferred tax\nassets and liabilities as well as depreciation and amortization, asset impairment charge and stock-based compensation expense. Cash\nprovided by operating activities was also driven by $110.9 million cash outflows for inventories.\nCash used for investing activities was $112.0 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, and was primarily related to $147.9\nmillion in purchases of property, plant, equipment, investments and intangibles. We also sold $63.1 million of marketable securities.\nCash provided by financing activities was $117.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, and was primarily related to net\nproceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility of $230.0 million, partially offset by payments on long-term borrowings of $107.0 million.\nNine Months Ended October 1, 2023\nCash provided by operating activities was $199.8 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2023, and reflected a net loss of $17.1\nmillion and non-cash adjustments of $366.6 million, primarily associated with depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation\nexpense and accretion of interest on deferred consideration. We benefited from collections on accounts receivables of $124.1 million,\nprimarily due to a COVID-19 government award, offset by other changes in working capital, including $146.0 million cash outflows for\ninventories.\nCash used for investing activities was $132.5 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2023, and was primarily related to $160.7\nmillion in purchases of property, plant, equipment, investments and intangibles. We also purchased $50.6 million and sold $68.3 million of\nmarketable securities.\nCash used for financing activities was $208.0 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2023, and was primarily related to payments on\nlong-term borrowings of $175.7 million, payments for deferred consideration of $30.3 million and payments of tax withholdings related to\nvesting of stock-based awards of $13.0 million.\nLiquidity Outlook\nShort-term Liquidity Outlook\nOur primary source of liquidity, other than our holdings of Cash and cash equivalents, has been cash flows from operations. Cash generated\nfrom operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet normal operating, investing and financing needs. We anticipate\nthat our current Cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under our Revolving\nCredit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our near-term capital and operating needs for at least the next 12 months.\nNormal operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital, R&D and\ncapital expenditures. Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:\n• interest on and repayments of our long-term borrowings and lease obligations;\n32\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 35/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\n• acquisitions of property, equipment and other fixed assets in support of our manufacturing facility expansions;\n• the continued advancement of R&D efforts;\n• our integration of the Ortho business arising from the Combinations;\n• support of commercialization efforts related to our current and future products, including support of our direct sales force and field\nsupport resources; and\n• potential strategic acquisitions and investments.\nDue to the risks inherent in the product development process, we are unable to estimate with meaningful certainty the costs we will incur in\nthe continued development of our product candidates for commercialization. Our R&D costs may be substantial as we move product\ncandidates into preclinical and clinical trials and advance our existing product candidates into later stages of development.\nThe primary purposes of our capital expenditures are to invest in manufacturing capacity expansion, acquire certain of our instruments,\nacquire scientific equipment, purchase or develop IT and implement facility improvements. We plan to fund the capital expenditures with\nthe cash on our balance sheet.\nWe are focused on expanding the number of instruments placed in the field and solidifying long-term contractual relationships with\ncustomers. In order to achieve this goal, in certain jurisdictions where it is permitted, we have leveraged a reagent rental model that has been\nrecognized as more attractive to certain customers. In this model, we lease, rather than sell, instruments to our customers. Over the term of\nthe contract, the purchase price of the instrument is embedded in the price of the assays and reagents. Going forward, we intend to increase\nthe number of reagent rental placements in developed markets, a strategy that we believe is beneficial to our commercial goals because it\nlowers our customers’ upfront capital costs and therefore allows purchasing decisions to be made at the lab manager level. For these same\nreasons, the reagent rental model also benefits our commercial strategy in emerging markets. We believe that the shift in our sales strategy\nwill grow our installed base, thereby increasing sales of higher-margin assays, reagents and other consumables over the life of the customer\ncontracts and enhancing our recurring revenue and cash flows. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we transferred\n$99.4 million of instrument inventories from Inventories to Property, plant and equipment, net, further increasing our investment in property,\nplant and equipment.\nLong-term Liquidity Outlook\nOur future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds to service any long-term debt outstanding and to fund working\ncapital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on many factors, including:\n• our ability to successfully integrate the Ortho business and realize cross-selling revenue synergies;\n• our ability to realize revenue growth from our new technologies and create innovative products in our markets;\n• outstanding debt and covenant restrictions;\n• our ability to leverage our operating expenses to realize operating profits as we grow revenue;\n• competing technological and market developments; and\n• our entry into strategic collaborations with other companies or acquisitions of other companies or technologies to enhance or\ncomplement our product and service offerings.\nOn March 1, 2024, our lease for warehouse space in the U.S. commenced. Information regarding the lease is included in “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThere have been no accounting pronouncements issued or adopted during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 that are expected to\nhave a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which\nhave been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Our critical accounting\nestimates are those that significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or\ncomplex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this\nuncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.\n33\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 36/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nA comprehensive discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report. Other than the following, there have been no significant changes to our critical\naccounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 29, 2024:\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter and monitor throughout the year for impairment\ntriggering events that indicate that the carrying value of one or more of our reporting units exceeds its fair value.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we concluded that (i) the sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization that occurred during\nthe first quarter of 2024, (ii) the faster than expected decline in COVID-19 and flu markets, and (iii) the delay in the timing of expected\ncommercialization for Savanna were triggering events requiring an interim goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units.\nBased on our interim goodwill impairment assessment in the first quarter of 2024, we concluded that the North America reporting unit’s\ncarrying value exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.7 billion in the first\nquarter of 2024 for the North America reporting unit, which represented a full impairment of the goodwill allocated to the North America\nreporting unit. The decline in the estimated fair value of the North America reporting unit and the resulting impairment were primarily\ndriven by revised short-term and mid-term forecasts for revenue and EBITDA expectations in North America.\nThe estimated fair values of our EMEA, Latin America and JPAC reporting units as of the interim testing date exceeded their respective\ncarrying values. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective\nreporting unit) ranged from approximately 30% to 150%. Due to the significant excess of fair value over carrying value of these reporting\nunits, they are less sensitive to changes in forecast assumptions. To evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the interim\ngoodwill impairment test for the EMEA, Latin America and JPAC reporting units, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values\nof each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 5% decrease,\nthe excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for\neach of our reporting units ranged from approximately 25% to 140%.\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units consisted of a fair value calculation that combines an income\napproach, using a discounted cash flow method, and a market approach, using the guideline public company method. The quantitative\ngoodwill impairment assessment requires the application of a number of significant assumptions, including estimates of future revenue\ngrowth rates, EBITDA margins, discount rates and market multiples. The projected future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, and\nthe resulting projected cash flows are based on historical experience and internal annual operating plans reviewed by management,\nextrapolated over the forecast period. Discount rates are determined using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk factors\nspecific to the reporting units. Market multiples are based on the guideline public company method using comparable publicly traded\ncompany multiples of revenue and EBITDA for a group of benchmark companies.\nWe believe the assumptions that were used in the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment are reasonable and consistent with\nassumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants.\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere has been no material change in our exposure to market risk from that described in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nAbout Market Risk” in our Annual Report.\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures: We have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act\nRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective as of September 29, 2024 at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports\nfiled or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\nrules and forms of the SEC. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost\nbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n34\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 37/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting: There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal\nquarter ended September 29, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n35\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1906324/000190632424000049/qdel-20240929.htm 38/42\n11/8/24, 2:51 PM qdel-20240929\nPART II OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

Blaser, President and Chief Executive Officer, QuidelOrtho. “We remain focused on our top business-critical priorities, including delivering on our customer commitments with the highest levels of quality and compliance, as well as executing on company-wide cost-savings and business efficiency initiatives. Further, we continue to reinforce the strength of our leadership team with key talent hires, while also aligning our organization to be more agile, reducing complexity and increasing customer focus.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024**\n\nThe Company reported total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 of $727 million, compared to $744 million in the prior year period. The decrease in total revenue was primarily due to higher COVID-19 and influenza revenue in the prior year period. Foreign currency translation impacted the Company’s Labs business by 100 basis points but did not significantly impact the Company’s overall third quarter 2024 revenue. \n\nGAAP diluted loss per share for the third quarter of 2024 was ($0.30), compared to diluted loss per share of ($0.19) in the prior year period. GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $20 million, compared to $13 million in the prior year period. GAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $15 million, compared to an operating income of $26 million in the prior year period, and GAAP operating margin was 2%, compared to 4% in the prior year period. Third quarter 2024 results included $37 million in integration-related charges. \n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.85, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.90 in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $171 million, compared to $169 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 23.5%, compared to 22.7% in the prior year period. \n\n_____________________________  \n---  \n1 |  Recurring revenue, a non-GAAP measure, means revenues from sales of our assays, reagents, consumables and services, and excludes instruments. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures.   \n2 |  Operating expenses includes Selling, Marketing and Administrative and Research and Development expenses.   \n  \n**Full-year 2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nThe Company reinstated its full year 2024 financial guidance as of November 7, 2024, as follows: \n\nTotal revenues (reported)  |  $2.75 - $2.80 billion   \n---|---  \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $530 – $550 million   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin  |  19.3% - 19.6%   \nAdjusted diluted EPS  |  $1.69 - $1.91   \n_Please see the Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results presentation on the “Investor Relations” page of the Company’s website for the assumptions on which the Company’s 2024 financial guidance is based._  \n  \nJoseph Busky, Chief Financial Officer of QuidelOrtho remarked, “Our decision to reinstate our full year financial guidance reflects our solid performance in the first nine months of the year, and more importantly, increased visibility into the impact of our cost-savings initiatives. This 2024 financial guidance is in line with the commentary we shared earlier this year. Looking forward, the cost-savings initiatives support our previously announced plan to achieve $100 million in annualized cost-savings and position us to realize incremental cost-savings in the future.” \n\nA reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted EPS, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not provided because comparable GAAP measures for such measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation. We are not, without unreasonable effort, able to reliably predict the impact of impairment charges and related tax benefits, employee compensation costs and other adjustments. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and may have a material impact on our future GAAP results. In addition, the Company believes any such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nQuidelOrtho will hold a conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss its financial results.

These statements are any statement contained herein that is not strictly historical, including, but not limited to, QuidelOrtho’s commercial, integration and other strategic goals, financial guidance and other future financial condition and operating results, including results of cost-savings initiatives, and other future plans, objectives, strategies, expectations and intentions. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “might,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “goal,” “project,” “strategy,” “future,” “continue” or similar words, expressions or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the beliefs and expectations of QuidelOrtho’s management as of today and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or outcomes may differ significantly from those set forth or implied in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth or implied in the forward-looking statements: fluctuations in demand for QuidelOrtho’s non-respiratory and respiratory products; supply chain, production, logistics, distribution and labor disruptions and challenges; the challenges and costs of integrating, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies as a result of the business combination of Quidel Corporation and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics Holdings plc; and other macroeconomic, geopolitical, market, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting the business of QuidelOrtho generally, including those discussed in QuidelOrtho’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), including under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of the Form 10-K. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events because these statements are based on assumptions that may not come true and are speculative by their nature. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to QuidelOrtho and speak only as of the date hereof. QuidelOrtho undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking information or time-sensitive information included in this press release, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed expectations or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release contains financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, including but not limited to “recurring revenue, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue,” “constant currency, recurring revenue and revenue changes, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue,” “constant currency, Labs revenue and revenue changes,” “non-GAAP operating expenses,” “adjusted diluted EPS,” “adjusted EBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA margin,” “adjusted free cash flow” and other non-GAAP financial measures included in the reconciliation tables accompanying this press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures eliminate impacts of certain non-cash, unusual or other items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance, and the Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management’s financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the Company’s historical operating results and comparison to competitors’ operating results. The Company’s definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and reports filed with the Commission in their entirety. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release. \n\n**QuidelOrtho** Consolidated Statements of Operations  (Unaudited)  (In millions except per share data)   \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \nTotal revenues  |  $  |  727.1  |  $  |  744.0  |  $  |  2,075.1  |  $  |  2,255.2   \nCost of sales, excluding amortization of intangibles  |  374.8  |  374.6  |  1,114.7  |  1,140.7   \nSelling, marketing and administrative  |  186.4  |  194.1  |  579.3  |  575.6   \nResearch and development  |  55.9  |  61.5  |  171.4  |  185.7   \nAmortization of intangible assets  |  51.9  |  51.4  |  155.5  |  153.6   \nIntegration related costs  |  36.8  |  26.5  |  90.3  |  80.4   \nGoodwill impairment charge  |  —  |  —  |  1,743.9  |  —   \nAsset impairment charge  |  —  |  2.2  |  56.9  |  3.2   \nOther operating expenses  |  6.3  |  7.4  |  23.6  |  17.0   \nOperating income (loss)  |  15.0  |  26.3  |  (1,860.5  |  )  |  99.0   \nInterest expense, net  |  42.9  |  37.7  |  122.9  |  110.9   \nOther expense, net  |  0.9  |  4.1  |  7.2  |  8.0   \nLoss before income taxes  |  (28.8  |  )  |  (15.5  |  )  |  (1,990.6  |  )  |  (19.9  |  )   \nBenefit from income taxes  |  (8.9  |  )  |  (2.8  |  )  |  (117.0  |  )  |  (2.8  |  )   \nNet loss  |  $  |  (19.9  |  )  |  $  |  (12.7  |  )  |  $  |  (1,873.6  |  )  |  $  |  (17.1  |  )   \nBasic loss per share  |  $  |  (0.30  |  )  |  $  |  (0.19  |  )  |  $  |  (27.92  |  )  |  $  |  (0.26  |  )   \nDiluted loss per share  |  $  |  (0.30  |  )  |  $  |  (0.19  |  )  |  $  |  (27.92  |  )  |  $  |  (0.26  |  )   \nWeighted-average shares outstanding -

All Rights Reserved. 2\nForward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nForward-Looking Statements: This presentation of QuidelOrtho Corporation (“QuidelOrtho” or the “Company”) contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are any statement contained herein that is not strictly historical, including, but not limited to, QuidelOrtho’s financial guidance and other\nfuture financial condition and operating results, including results of cost-savings initiatives, and other future plans, objectives, strategies, expectations and intentions. Without limiting the foregoing, the\nwords “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “might,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “goal,” “project,” “strategy,” “future,” “continue” or similar words, expressions or the\nnegative of such terms or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the beliefs and expectations of QuidelOrtho’s management\nas of today and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or outcomes may differ significantly from those set forth or implied in the forward-looking\nstatements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth or implied in the forward-looking statements: fluctuations in demand for QuidelOrtho’s non-\nrespiratory and respiratory products; supply chain, production, logistics, distribution and labor disruptions and challenges;the challenges and costs of integrating, restructuring and achieving anticipated\nsynergies as a result of the business combination of Quidel Corporation and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics Holdings plc; and other macroeconomic, geopolitical, market, business, competitive and/or\nregulatory factors affecting the business of QuidelOrtho generally, including those discussed in QuidelOrtho’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent\nreports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), including under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”ofthe Form 10-K. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as\npredictions of future events because these statements are based on assumptions that may not come true and are speculative by their nature. All forward-looking statements are based on information\ncurrently available to QuidelOrtho and speak only as of the date hereof. QuidelOrtho undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking information or time-sensitive information included in\nthis presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed expectations or otherwise, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: This presentation contains financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable rules and regulations of the Commission,\nincluding but not limited to \"constant currency revenue and revenue changes,\" \"recurring revenue and revenue changes, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue,\" \"recurring revenue\nand revenue changes, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue and one-time third-party collaboration settlement,\" “constant currency, recurring revenue and revenue changes, excluding\nCOVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue,\" “constant currency, recurring revenue and revenue changes, excluding COVID-19 and U.S. Donor Screening revenue and one-time third-party\ncollaboration settlement,\" \"constant currency, Labs recurring revenue and revenue changes,\" \"non-GAAP operating expenses,\" \"adjusted diluted EPS,” \"adjusted diluted EPS growth,\" “adjusted\nEBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA margin,” \"adjusted free cash flow,\" \"adjusted gross profit,\" \"adjusted gross profit margin\" and other non-GAAP financial measures included in the reconciliation tables in the\nAppendix of this presentation. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for,financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures eliminate impacts of certain non-cash, unusual or other items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing\noperating performance, and the Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management’s financial andoperational decision-making, including evaluation of the\nCompany’s historical operating results and comparison to competitors’ operating results. The Company’s definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by\nothers. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that\nwill increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and reports filed with the\nCommission in their entirety.

A reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted dilutedEPS, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not provided because comparable GAAP measures for such\nmeasures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation. We are not, without unreasonable effort, able to reliably predict the impact of\nimpairment charges and related tax benefits, employee compensation costs and other adjustments. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and may have a material impact on our future GAAP results. In addition, the Company believes\nany such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors.
