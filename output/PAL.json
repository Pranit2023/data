          "content": "PROFICIENT AUTO LOGISTICS REPORTS\nFIRST QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nJACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA – June 18, 2024 — Proficient Auto Logistics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PAL) today reported the financial results for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 for Proficient Auto Logistics, Inc. (“Proficient”), Proficient Auto Transport, Inc. (“Proficient Transport”) and for the five\nFounding Companies (as defined below) on a combined basis.\nOn May 13, 2024, Proficient completed the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of its common stock. Prior to the IPO, Proficient had entered into\nagreements to acquire in multiple, separate acquisitions (the “Combinations”) five operating businesses and their respective affiliated entities, as\napplicable, operating under the following names: (i) Delta Auto Transport, Inc. (“Delta”), (ii) Deluxe Auto Carriers, Inc. (“Deluxe”), (iii) Sierra Mountain\nGroup, Inc. (“Sierra”), (iv) Proficient Transport, and (v) Tribeca Automotive Inc. (“Tribeca” and, together with Delta, Deluxe, Sierra, and Proficient\nTransport, the “Founding Companies”). On May 13, 2024, in connection with the closing of the IPO, Proficient also completed the acquisitions of all the\nFounding Companies.\nHighlights (all on a combined basis)\nOperating Income of $6.54 million, an increase of 7.9%\nIncome before taxes of $5.35 million, an increase of 12.1%\nOperating Ratio of 93.2% compared to 94.1% in 2023\nTotal Units delivered of 460,210 in 2024, an increase of 2%\n“We are excited that our five founding companies have successfully completed their combination and IPO and have begun operating as one\ncombined company,” said Rick O’Dell, Proficient’s chief executive officer. “Despite the labor strikes at two of our largest customers in late 2023, our\nfounding companies turned in a solid first quarter and we look forward to more normalized manufacturing levels and industry tailwinds supporting our\ngrowth going forward.”\n“Upon the closing of the IPO and Combinations, the Company immediately initiated the execution of its identified key operating initiatives,\nwhich include:\n● Achieving cost synergies afforded by enhanced scale;\n● Reducing empty miles – increasing utilization – in overlapping geographies;\n● Increasing owned fleet to reduce suboptimal purchased transportation;\n● Increasing marketing to used car and fleet operations, further reducing empty miles;\n● Implementing activity-based costing systems to ensure optimum pricing and profitability.\nWhile these operating initiatives will be long-term and ongoing in nature, the financial impact of each should become evident over the coming\nquarters, which we will highlight in our future communications.”\nFor accounting and reporting purposes, Proficient has been identified as the designated accounting acquirer of each of the Founding Companies\nand Proficient Transport has been identified as the designated accounting predecessor to the Company. As a result, the unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements as of, and for the three months ended, March 31, 2024 for each of Proficient and Proficient Transport are included in the Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q. The Company is not required to provide, and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not contain, pro forma financial data giving\neffect to the completion of the Combinations and the completion of the IPO and the use of the proceeds therefrom. However, the Company is providing\nsummary unaudited combined financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2024 below. The summary unaudited combined financial\ninformation has been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Proficient’s and the Founding Companies’ management. This information has not been\nsubjected to audit, review or agreed-upon procedures of any audit firm, and therefore, there is no independent opinion or any other form of assurance with\nrespect thereto.\nSummary Unaudited Combined Financial Information\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDollars in 000’s 2024 2023\nRevenue before Fuel Surcharge $ 91,036 $ 95,416\nFuel surcharge and reimbursements 4,520 6,929\nTotal Operating Revenue $ 95,556 $ 102,345\nTotal Operating Expenses 89,018 96,283\nTotal Operating Income 6,539 6,062\nOperating Ratio 93.2% 94.1%\nIncome before taxes 5,352 4,775\nAdd Back:\nDepreciation and Amortization 4,324 4,605\nInterest Expense 1,187 1,287\nEBITDA (1) $ 10,863 $ 10,667\nEBITDA Margin 11.4% 10.4%\n(1) Our management team reviews EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to measure the operating performance and financial condition of our\nbusiness and to make strategic decisions. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure financial performance\nbut includes adjustments that are not included in the most comparable GAAP measure. See the Appendix for additional information regarding the use\nof EBITDA.\n2\nThe prospectus filed in connection with our IPO that closed on May 13, 2024 included preliminary combined operating results for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 based on the information that was available at that time. Those results were stated as a range of possible results, rather than\nspecific amounts, because our financial account closing procedures were not yet complete at the time of the filing. The amounts shown above reflect the\nunaudited summary combined financial results following the completion of account closing procedures and include certain reclassifications made in the\ncompletion of those procedures. It should be noted that the amounts shown above include the combined operating results of the five Founding Companies\nwithout any pro forma adjustments that would give effect to the completion of the IPO or any related expenses or adjustments recognized as a result of\nthe IPO and concurrent Combinations. The results of Proficient are also not included in the amounts shown above for the three months ended March 31,\n2024 as there were no comparative results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the expenses incurred by Proficient in the first quarter of 2024\nwere solely for the purpose of affecting the IPO and related transactions rather than operating in nature.\nRevenue before Fuel Surcharge. Revenue before Fuel Surcharge declined $4.4 million, or 4.6%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 in\ncomparison to the comparable quarter of 2023. This overall decline reflects lower demand early in the quarter from domestic original equipment\nmanufacturing companies (“OEMs”) impacted by the United Auto Workers strikes in fall 2023, which manifested in a gap in produced vehicles available\nfor delivery during the quarter. This was particularly impactful to the dedicated fleet business, which is designed to address excess inventory situations, of\nwhich there were fewer during this time. Excluding the dedicated fleet business, total unit deliveries increased approximately 2% year-over-year and\naverage revenue per unit delivered increased from $180 in the first quarter of 2023 to $184 in the first quarter of 2024 – which is approximately 2%.\nFuel Surcharge and reimbursements. Fuel Surcharge and reimbursements declined $2.4 million, or approximately 35%, for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2024 in comparison to the comparable quarter of 2023. These reimbursements fluctuate with the price of fuel, which was down year-over-year.\nA similar decrease was experienced in our corresponding fuel expense which is a component of total operating expenses discussed below.\nTotal Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses declined by $7.3 million, or 7.5%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 in comparison to\nthe comparable quarter of 2023. The largest components of this decline were in purchased transportation ($3.1 million) and truck expenses ($2.3 million).\nWhile both of these categories could generally be expected to decline along with revenue, truck expenses declined both in absolute dollars and as a\npercentage of revenue (down approximately 140 basis points), reflecting lower fuel costs but also a further uptick in the percentage of overall revenue\nattributable to subhaul of approximately 67% during the first quarter of 2024 versus 66% during the first quarter of 2023. The decline in purchased\ntransportation expense reflects the lower demand in the dedicated fleet business discussed above; however, as a percent of revenue purchased\ntransportation expense increased approximately 20 basis points year-over-year due to the shift in business mix noted above.\nTotal Operating Income and Operating Ratio. Despite the decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2024, operating income increased 7.9%\nyear-over-year, or $477,000, reflecting an approximate 90 basis point improvement in the operating ratio (total operating expense divided by total\nrevenue).\nIncome before taxes. Income before taxes increased by $577,000 year-over-year due to the combined result of the improved operating ratio\nnoted above and slightly lower interest expense in the first quarter of 2024 reflecting declining debt balances since the first quarter of 2023.\nEBITDA. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased by approximately 1.8% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to\nthe same period of 2023, as the decrease in revenue year-over-year was slightly less than the decrease in operating expense before depreciation. EBITDA\nmargin (EBITDA divided by total revenue), however, improved by approximately 100 basis points to 11.4% in the first quarter of 2024 on the strength of\nthe improved operating ratio described above.\n___________________\n3\nSummary Condensed Financial Information – Accounting Acquiror (Proficient) and Accounting Predecessor (Proficient Transport)\nThe tables below summarize the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended, March 31, 2024 for each of\nProficient and Proficient Transport as included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31.\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nProficient Auto Logistics\nTotal expenses $ 310 --\nNet loss (310) --\nLoss per share $ (0.11) --\nProficient Transport\nTotal operating income $ 27,827 $ 34,253\nTotal operating expenses 25,801 31,323\nTotal operating income 2,025 2,930\nNet Income 1,185 1,962\nEBITDA (1) 2,665 3,521\n(1) Our management team reviews EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to measure the operating performance and financial condition of our\nbusiness and to make strategic decisions.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to possible or assume future results of our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, liquidity, plans and objectives. You can generally identify forward-looking statements because they contain\nwords such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,”\n“estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans\nor intentions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections regarding future events and trends that\nwe believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking\nstatements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Registration Statement on Form S-1\n(333-278629) (the “Registration Statement”), and elsewhere in the Registration Statement. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking\nstatements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements\nwill be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: the economic conditions in the global\nmarkets in which we operate; our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and\ncustomer preferences, and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings of such strategies and actions; our ability to recruit and retain\nqualified driving associates, independent contractors and third-party auto transportation and logistics companies; an increase in the frequency or severity\nof accidents or other claims; our expectations regarding the successful implementation of the Combinations; geopolitical developments and additional\nchanges in international trade policies and relations; the effect of any international conflicts or terrorist activities, on the United States and global\neconomies in general, the transportation industry, or us in particular, and what effects these events will have on our costs and the demand for our services;\nour ability to manage our network capacity and cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses, and match it to shifting and future\ncustomer volume levels; our ability to compete effectively against current and future competitors; our ability to maintain our profitability despite\nquarterly fluctuations in our results, whether due to seasonality, large cyclical events, or other causes; and our future financial and operating results; our\nexpectations regarding the period during which we will qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act; and our use of the net proceeds\nfrom the IPO and the sufficiency of our existing cash to fund our future operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements.\nThe forward-looking statements made in this document relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no\nobligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the\noccurrence of unanticipated events. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and\nyou should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements,\nwhether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\n5\nAppendix\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). However,\nmanagement believes that EBITDA provides useful information in measuring our operating performance, generating future operating plans and making\nstrategic decisions regarding allocation of capital. Management believes this information presents helpful comparisons of financial performance between\nperiods by excluding the effect of certain non-recurring items.\nEBITDA does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures\npresented by other companies, and it should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with\nGAAP.\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) for the period adjusted for interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and\namortization expense.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income, the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA for Proficient\nTransport:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nProficient Transport\nNet income $ 1,184,632 $ 1,961,621\nInterest expense 452,390 261,944\nIncome tax expense 388,878 706,430\nDepreciation and amortization expense 639,337 590,656\nEBITDA $ 2,665,237 $ 3,520,651\n6"

See “Summary Unaudited Combined Financial Information” on the following page for additional information regarding the use of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Ratio and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure.   \n  \n“Proficient Auto Logistics produced strong operating results during the second quarter in spite of weakening customer demand during June,” said Rick O’Dell, Proficient’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are also very pleased to announce that we will be adding what is essentially a sixth founding company to the organization when we close on the purchase of Auto Transport Group (ATG) during the third quarter.” \n\n“We expect to close on the acquisition of Auto Transport Group during August, “said Mr. O’Dell. “ATG is based in Ogden, Utah and this strategic acquisition enhances the density of our coverage in the West. ATG is led by its CEO, Brent Larsen, and will maintain its strong brand within the Proficient Auto Logistics umbrella of companies. ATG has an outstanding management team, great service, robust technology platforms and industry leading margins.” \n\n“We’re excited for the go to market collaboration opportunity offered by the combination with Proficient Auto Logistics,” added Brent Larsen. “It’s a great opportunity to expand the Company that we have built over the past 25 years.” \n\nWe continue to make progress on Proficient’s key operating priorities, however, given the long-term nature of these initiatives we expect the financial impacts to become more evident over the next twelve to eighteen months. Implementation of best practices across the Founding Companies and coordination of operations, including load-sharing opportunities and other integrations, have started to show up in the combined operating ratio during the second quarter. \n\nFor accounting and reporting purposes, Proficient has been identified as the designated accounting acquirer of each of the Founding Companies and Proficient Transport has been identified as the designated accounting predecessor to the Company. As a result, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of, and for the three and six months ended, June 30, 2024 for each of Proficient and Proficient Transport are to be included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company is not required to provide, and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will not contain, pro forma financial data giving effect to the completion of the combination transactions forming the Company (the “Combinations”) and the completion of the Company’s initial public offering (the “IPO”) and the use of the proceeds therefrom. However, the Company is providing below summary unaudited combined financial information for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The summary unaudited combined financial information has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Proficient’s and the Founding Companies’ management. This information has not been subjected to audit, review or agreed-upon procedures of any audit firm, and therefore, there is no independent auditors’ opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. \n\n**Summary Unaudited Combined Financial Information**\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n(Dollars in thousands)   \nRevenue before Fuel Surcharge  |  $  |  100,824  |  $  |  95,389   \nFuel surcharge and reimbursements  |  5,783  |  5,387   \nTotal Operating Revenue  |  $  |  106,607  |  $  |  100,776   \nTotal Operating Expenses  |  99,566  |  93,467   \nTotal Operating Income  |  7,041  |  7,309   \nAdd Back:   \nAmortization of Intangible Assets  |  1,076  |  —   \nStock Compensation Expense  |  613  |  —   \nAdjusted Operating Income (1)  |  8,730  |  7,309   \n**_Adjusted Operating Ratio (1)_** |  91.8%  |  92.7%   \nIncome before taxes  |  5,793  |  6,051   \nAdd Back:   \nDepreciation and Amortization  |  4,761  |  4,725   \nStock Compensation Expense  |  613  |  —   \nInterest Expense  |  1,247  |  1,258   \nAdjusted EBITDA (2)  |  $  |  12,414  |  $  |  12,034   \n**_Adjusted EBITDA Margin (2)_** |  11.6%  |  11.9%   \n  \n(1)  |  Our management team reviews Adjusted Operating Income and the related Adjusted Operating Ratio, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, as a basis for comparing the results of financial reporting periods excluding the impact of non-cash expenses related solely to our recent IPO and the concurrent corporate combinations. These measures provide management with the requisite insight regarding progress on operating and integration initiatives. The table above provides a reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to the most comparable GAAP measure and Adjusted Operating Ratio flows from that.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Our management team reviews Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, to measure the operating performance and financial condition of our business and to make strategic decisions. See the Appendix for additional information regarding the use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure and Adjusted EBITDA Margin flows from that.   \n  \nThe amounts shown above reflect the unaudited summary combined financial results of the five Founding Companies for the full three-month periods presented without any pro forma adjustments that would give effect to the completion of the IPO or any related transaction expenses or adjustments recognized as a result of the IPO and concurrent Combinations. The results of Proficient (acquiror entity) are included in the three months ended June 30, 2024; however, they reflect only those operating expenses incurred following the closing of the IPO and concurrent Combinations (May 13 – June 30, 2024). There are no comparative expenses of Proficient during the three months ended June 30, 2023, as the company had not yet been formed. \n\n_Revenue before Fuel Surcharge_. Revenue before Fuel Surcharge increased $5.4 million, or 5.7%, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, in comparison to the comparable quarter of 2023. This increase reflects strong customer demand during April and May, with year-over-year revenue up approximately 11% for that two-month period. Demand slowed significantly during June – with 2024 revenue lower by approximately 8% compared to June 2023, which resulted in the 5.7% increase for the full quarter referenced above. Excluding the dedicated fleet business – which continues to be dramatically reduced versus 2023, total unit deliveries increased approximately 12% over the prior year second quarter and average revenue per unit delivered increased from $183 in the second quarter of 2023 to $189 in the second quarter of 2024 – which is an approximate 3% increase. \n\n_Fuel Surcharge and reimbursements_. Fuel Surcharge and reimbursements increased $0.4 million, or approximately 7%, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, in comparison to the comparable quarter of 2023. These reimbursements generally fluctuate with the price of fuel, which during the three-month periods ending June 30 of the respective years were essentially unchanged. \n\n_Total Operating Expenses_. Total operating expenses increased by $6.1 million, or 6.5%, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, in comparison to the comparable quarter of 2023. The largest components of this increase were in purchased transportation ($2.0 million); salaries, wages and benefits ($1.8 million); and general and administrative expenses ($1.2 million). Although purchased transportation increased by $2.0 million year-over-year, it was lower as a percentage of revenue by approximately 111 basis points (51.1% in 2024 compared to 52.2% in 2023). The percentage of overall revenue attributable to subhaul was approximately 67% during the second quarter of 2024 – essentially unchanged from the first quarter of this year - versus 66% for the comparable quarter in 2023. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits compared to 2023 reflects a combination of driver compensation on higher revenues in the 2024 period as well as new public company costs that were part of the 2024 quarter. Specifically, stock compensation expense of approximately $613,000 was recognized for the period between the IPO and quarter end. Likewise, general and administrative expenses for the 2024 period included approximately $327,000 of public company costs including director compensation, director and officer insurance premiums, and other legal and exchange fees. Depreciation and amortization expense included $1.1 million of amortization of intangible assets resulting from the business combinations consummated on May 13, 2024; there was no comparable amortization during the second quarter of 2023. \n\n_Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Ratio_. Adjusted operating income increased 19.4% year-over-year, or $1.4 million, reflecting an approximate 90 basis point improvement in the operating ratio (total operating expense divided by total revenue). The ratio improvement was largely due to the decrease in purchased transportation, as a percentage of revenue (110 basis points) partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses from public company costs. \n\n_Income before taxes_. Income before taxes decreased by $258,000 year-over-year due to the combined result of the improved operating ratio noted above offset by the addition of non-cash stock compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. \n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock compensation expense increased by approximately 3.2% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, almost entirely on the strength of increased adjusted operating income described above. Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue) of 11.6% was improved by 20 basis points over the first quarter of this year, but 30 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2023. \n\n**Summary Condensed Financial Information – Successor (Proficient)**\n\nThe tables below summarize the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2024, for Proficient included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \n\n**Three Months Ended June 30, 2024**  \n---  \n(in thousands, except per share amounts)   \nTotal operating revenue  |  $55,909   \nTotal operating expenses  |  58,517   \nOperating loss  |  (2,608)   \nNet loss  |  (3,552)   \nAdjusted Earnings per Share, basic (1)  |  0.28   \nAdjusted Earnings per Share, diluted (1)  |  0.28   \nAdjusted EBITDA (2)  |  8,731   \n  \n_______________   \n---  \n(1)  |  Our management team reviews Adjusted Earnings Per Share, a non-GAAP financial measure, a measure of the company’s profitability that indicates how much after-tax profit each outstanding share of common stock has earned.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to possible or assume future results of our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, plans and objectives. You can generally identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections regarding future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (333-278629) (the “Registration Statement”), and elsewhere in the Registration Statement. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: the economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate; our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings of such strategies and actions; our ability to recruit and retain qualified driving associates, independent contractors and third-party auto transportation and logistics companies; an increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or other claims; our expectations regarding the successful implementation of the Combinations; geopolitical developments and additional changes in international trade policies and relations; the effect of any international conflicts or terrorist activities, on the United States and global economies in general, the transportation industry, or us in particular, and what effects these events will have on our costs and the demand for our services; our ability to manage our network capacity and cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses, and match it to shifting and future customer volume levels; our ability to compete effectively against current and future competitors; our ability to maintain our profitability despite quarterly fluctuations in our results, whether due to seasonality, large cyclical events, or other causes; and our future financial and operating results; our expectations regarding the period during which we will qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act; and our use of the net proceeds from the IPO and the sufficiency of our existing cash to fund our future operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements. \n\nThe forward-looking statements made in this document relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\n**Appendix**\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure**\n\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). However, management believes that EBITDA provides useful information in measuring our operating performance, generating future operating plans and making strategic decisions regarding allocation of capital. Management believes this information presents helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the effect of certain non-recurring items. \n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and it should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) for the period adjusted for interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense and stock compensation expense. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income, the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA for Proficient: \n\nThree Months Ended  June 30,   \n---  \n(in thousands)  |  2024   \nProficient (Successor)   \nNet loss  |  $  |  (3,552  |  )   \nInterest expense  |  640   \nIncome tax expense  |  470   \nDepreciation and amortization expense  |  4,497   \nStock compensation expense  |  6,676   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  8,731   \n  \n_Adjusted EPS_\n\nAdjusted EPS does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and it should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\nAdjusted EPS is defined net income (loss) net of intangible amortization and expense and stock compensation expense per common share computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted adjusted net income (loss) net of intangible amortization and expense and stock compensation expense per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common stock and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income, the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EPS for Proficient: \n\nThree Months Ended  June 30,   \n---  \n(in thousands, except per share amounts)  |  2024   \nProficient (Successor)   \nNet loss  |  $  |  (3,552  |  )   \nIntangible amortization expense  |  1,076   \nStock compensation expense  |  6,676   \nAdjusted Net Income  |  $  |  4,200   \nAdjusted Earnings per Share, basic (2)  |  $  |  0.28   \nAdjusted Earnings per Share, diluted (2)  |  $  |  0.28   \n  \n## Contacts\n\nInvestor Relations: Brad Wright Chief Financial Officer and Secretary Phone: 904-506-4317 email: Investor.relations@proficientautologistics.com\n\n![](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20240809132237/en/2211850/2/PAL_logo_White_Outline.jpg)\n\n### Proficient Auto Logistics, Inc.\n\n[NASDAQ:PAL ![](/images/icons/icon_stocks.gif)](https://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/index.jsp?epi-content=MY_COMPANIES_CHART&symbol=PAL) [![](/images/icons/icon_filings.gif)](https://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/index.jsp?epi-content=FINANCIAL_POPUP&sec=1&action=showFilingResults&symbol=PAL)\n\n## More News[![RSS feed for Proficient Auto Logistics, Inc.](/images/icons/icon_rss.gif)](http://feed.businesswire.com/rss/home/company/Proficient+Auto+Logistics%2C+Inc./Z-iaJ9XruvRyG1RYonz5Eg==)\n\n  * November 08, 2024\n\n[Proficient Auto Logistics Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241108256857/en/Proficient-Auto-Logistics-Reports-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results)\n  * October 30, 2024\n\n[Proficient Auto Logistics Appoints Brenda Frank to Board of Directors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030250554/en/Proficient-Auto-Logistics-Appoints-Brenda-Frank-to-Board-of-Directors)\n  * October 16, 2024\n\n[Proficient Auto Logistics Provides Update on Expected Operating and Financial Metrics for Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024; Sets Date to Report Third Quarter Financial Results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241016735722/en/Proficient-Auto-Logistics-Provides-Update-on-Expected-Operating-and-Financial-Metrics-for-Third-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2024-Sets-Date-to-Report-Third-Quarter-Financial-Results)\n\n\n\n## Contacts\n\nInvestor Relations: Brad Wright Chief Financial Officer and Secretary Phone: 904-506-4317 email: Investor.relations@proficientautologistics.com\n\n## Search\n\n### Search Options\n\n  * [Search All](#?type=all \"Search All\")\n  * [Search News](#?type=news \"Search News\")\n  * [Search Site](#?type=site \"Search Site\")\n  * [Advanced News Search](/portal/site/home/search?javax.portlet.tpst=503a8767054f0df6a9e77a100d908a0c&javax.portlet.pbp_503a8767054f0df6a9e77a100d908a0c_view=advancedSearch&javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken \"Advanced News Search\")\n\n\n\nAdvanced News Search ![Search](/images/icons/icon_search.gif)\n\n  * [Log In](/portal/site/home/template.LOGIN/)\n  * [Sign Up](/portal/site/home/signup/)\n\n\n"

          "content": "Proficient Auto Logistics Provides Update on Expected Operating\nand Financial Metrics for Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024; Sets Date to\nReport Third Quarter Financial Results\nOctober 16, 2024 04:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Proficient Auto Logistics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PAL) today provided an update on\ncertain expected operating and financial metrics for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nAs noted during the Company’s second quarter earnings call in early August, unit volumes slowed during June with the\nslowdown continuing into July. While there were specific events in July – such as seasonal plant closures during the first\ntwo weeks of the month – the Company also made note of its OEM customers’ cautionary tone regarding their outlook for\nthe second half of 2024.\nWeakness in unit volumes continued throughout the third quarter of 2024, resulting in estimated unit volumes of flat to a\ndecline of 1% compared to combined unit volumes for the third quarter of 2023. Volume underperformance resulted\nprimarily from significantly less dedicated fleet, brokerage and spot buy opportunities, which are typically at premium\npricing, the combined result being an estimated $90 - $92 million in revenue for the third quarter, which represents a\ndecline of 14 - 16% compared to combined revenue for the third quarter of 2023. Given the reduced level of revenue and\nresulting loss of operating leverage, the Company expects that net income for the third quarter of 2024 will be significantly\ndegraded compared to results reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\nMacroeconomic factors affecting unit volumes include a decline in vehicle SAAR (seasonally adjusted annual sales rates),\nwhich for the full quarter ending September 30, 2024, was estimated to be lower by 1.9% compared to the same quarter in\n2023. The Company’s management notes industry commentary that vehicle sales were negatively impacted by consumers\nfeeling the adverse effect of an uncertain job market as well as possibly waiting for anticipated interest rate cuts before\ncommitting to big ticket purchases such as autos.\nThe Company’s longer-term operating initiatives, including post-acquisition integration efforts, remain on pace and the\nCompany is seeing evidence of on-going improvement in its competitive position in the auto hauling industry, both from\nincreased market share as well as the recent acquisition of the Auto Transport Group, LC. While a protracted east coast\nlongshoremen strike could have negatively impacted unit volumes during the fourth quarter of 2024 and beyond, the short\nduration of the work stoppage should have a modest impact at most. The Company will provide further details regarding\nthese matters when it reports its final results for the third quarter of 2024 in early November.\nThe preceding information reflects our preliminary estimates with respect to our operating results for the three months\nended September 30, 2024, which are based on currently available information and are subject to change. We have\nprovided ranges, rather than specific amounts, for the preliminary operating results described above primarily because our\nfinancial closing procedures for the three months ended September 30, 2024, are not yet complete and, as a result, our\nfinal operating results upon completion of our closing procedures may vary from these preliminary estimates. These\npreliminary estimates should not be viewed as a substitute for interim financial statements prepared in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nThe preliminary operating results have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company’s management. This\ninformation has not been subjected to audit, review or agreed-upon procedures of any audit firm, and therefore, there is no\nindependent opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host an investor conference call at 9:00 a.m. EST on November 8, 2024, to discuss its final results for\nthe third quarter of 2024. Investors are invited to join the conference call by registering through this link:\nhttps://register.vevent.com/register/BIa4ca1dc40b7a4f09acf1b73b5360ddb5; once registered, you will receive a dial-in\nand a unique pin to join the conference.

(NASDAQ: PAL) (the “Company” or “Proficient”) today reported its financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and comparative summary financial information for the Founding Companies (as defined below) on a combined basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter Summary (third quarter 2023 information on a combined basis)** Total Operating Revenue of $91.5 million, a decrease of 12.5% Total Operating Loss of ($2.2) million, versus operating income of $8.2 million Adjusted Operating Income(1) of $1.1 million, versus operating income of $8.2 million Adjusted Operating Ratio(1) of 98.8% compared to 92.2% Total Units delivered of 499,311, a decrease of 0.4% \n\n(1) |  Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Summary Unaudited Combined Financial Information” on the following page for additional information regarding the use of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Ratio and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure.   \n---|---  \n  \nRick O’Dell, Proficient’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Proficient’s third quarter financial results reflect broad-based reductions in auto shipments as manufacturers sought to address excessive inventory on dealer lots. Our market share continued to increase over the course of the quarter, however, as evidenced by a year-over-year volume decline of 0.4% in our portfolio compared to an overall 1.9% decline in SAAR for the same period. The soft market reduced the level of demand for our dedicated fleet service as well as much of the opportunity for ad hoc spot buys during the quarter – both of which typically command a price premium relative to contract services – and this had a detrimental impact on our revenue mix and operating ratio during the quarter.” \n\nProgress continues on Proficient’s integration of the five Founding Companies, as well as now bringing Auto Transport Group (“ATG”) into this process following the successful completion of its acquisition, which closed on August 16, 2024. The Company is on track to have all operating subsidiaries on a common transportation management system before the end of this year and common financial accounting and reporting systems by January 2025. \n\nOn May 13, 2024, Proficient completed the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of its common stock. Prior to the IPO, Proficient had entered into agreements to acquire in multiple, separate acquisitions (the “Combinations”) five operating businesses and their respective affiliated entities, as applicable, operating under the following names: (i) Delta Auto Transport, Inc. (“Delta”), (ii) Deluxe Auto Carriers, Inc. (“Deluxe”), (iii) Sierra Mountain Group, Inc. (“Sierra”), (iv) Proficient Auto Transport Inc. (“Proficient Transport”), and (v) Tribeca Automotive Inc. (“Tribeca” and, together with Delta, Deluxe, Sierra, and Proficient Transport, the “Founding Companies”). On May 13, 2024, in connection with the closing of the IPO, Proficient also completed the acquisitions of all the Founding Companies. \n\nFor accounting and reporting purposes, Proficient has been identified as the designated accounting acquirer of each of the Founding Companies and Proficient Transport has been identified as the designated accounting predecessor to the Company. As a result, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of, and for the three and nine months ended, September 30, 2024 for each of Proficient and Proficient Transport are to be included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company is not required to provide, and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will not contain, pro forma financial data giving effect to the completion of the Combinations and the completion of the Company’s IPO and the use of the proceeds therefrom. However, the Company is providing below summary unaudited combined financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The summary unaudited combined financial information has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Proficient’s and the Founding Companies’ management. This information has not been subjected to audit, review or agreed-upon procedures of any audit firm, and therefore, there is no independent auditors’ opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. \n\n**Summary Unaudited Combined Financial Information(1)**\n\n**_($000s)_** |  **Three months ending -** |  **Nine months ending -**  \n---|---|---  \n**9/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023** |  **9/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \n**Total Operating Revenue** |  $  |  91,506  |  $  |  104,565  |  $  |  293,669  |  $  |  305,150   \nTotal Operating Income / (Loss)  |  (2,186  |  )  |  8,205  |  12,856  |  22,885   \nAdd back:   \nAmortization of Intangibles  |  2,217  |  -  |  3,294  |  -   \nStock Compensation expense  |  1,071  |  -  |  1,684  |  -   \n**Adjusted Operating Income(2)** |  1,102  |  8,205  |  17,834  |  22,885   \n**Adjusted Operating Ratio(2)** |  **_98.8_** |  **_%_** |  **_92.2_** |  **_%_** |  **_93.9_** |  **_%_** |  **_92.5_** |  **_%_**  \nIncome / (loss) before income taxes  |  (1,693  |  )  |  7,235  |  10,914  |  19,156   \nAdd back:   \nDepreciation & Amortization  |  8,784  |  4,781  |  16,792  |  14,096   \nStock Compensation Expense  |  1,071  |  -  |  1,684  |  -   \nInterest Expense  |  1,397  |  961  |  3,831  |  3,406   \n**Adjusted EBITDA(3)** |  9,559  |  12,977  |  33,221  |  36,658   \n**Adjusted EBITDA Margin(3)** |  **_10.4_** |  **_%_** |  **_12.4_** |  **_%_** |  **_11.3_** |  **_%_** |  **_12.0_** |  **_%_**  \n  \n(1) |  The amounts shown above reflect the unaudited summary combined financial results of the five Founding Companies for the full three-month and nine-month periods presented without any pro forma adjustments that would give effect to the completion of the IPO or any related transaction expenses or adjustments recognized as a result of the IPO and concurrent Combinations. The results of Proficient (acquiror entity) are included in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024; however, they reflect only those operating expenses incurred following the closing of the IPO and concurrent Combinations (May 13 – September 30, 2024). There are no comparative expenses of Proficient during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.   \n---|---  \n  \n(2) |  Our management team reviews Adjusted Operating Income and the related Adjusted Operating Ratio, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, as a basis for comparing the results of financial reporting periods excluding the impact of non-cash expenses related solely to our recent IPO and the concurrent corporate combinations. These measures provide management with the requisite insight regarding progress on operating and integration initiatives. The table above provides a reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to the most comparable GAAP measure and Adjusted Operating Ratio flows from that.   \n---|---  \n  \n(3) |  Our management team reviews Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, to measure the operating performance and financial condition of our business and to make strategic decisions.

The information for Proficient (acquiror entity) are included in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe year-over-year decline in revenue reflects a pronounced change in the mix of revenue sources during the third quarter of 2024. Company unit deliveries increased 1.1% compared to the third quarter of 2023 as Proficient began expansion of its fleet and the lower overall industry volume was absorbed mostly by reducing subhaul deliveries. The 17.5% decline in per unit revenue for subhaulers reflects a much lower spot buy opportunity and significantly reduced market price points for the spot buys that did occur. In addition, the dedicated fleet portion of Proficient’s revenue declined from $16.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, its highest quarterly revenue since the beginning of 2023, to $4.7 million in the most recent quarter. \n\nAt this lower level of revenue, the operating leverage to cover fixed costs declined as reflected in the higher adjusted operating ratio. Adding back depreciation costs, which have increased due to valuation increases on the merger dates in addition to fleet expansion, results in Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.5% for the most recent quarter, down from 12.4% in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, approximately $22 million of cash was used to partially fund the purchase of ATG and approximately $2 million for revenue equipment purchases not otherwise financed, offset by cash generated from operations. Property and equipment, net, increased by $15 million during the quarter through the addition of ATG’s fleet and new equipment purchases, net of depreciation recorded during the quarter. A corresponding increase in debt financing was the combined result of financing equipment purchases and partially funding the cash portion of the ATG acquisition. Net debt (total debt minus cash) of approximately $58 million on September 30, 2024 equates to a net leverage ratio of 1.3x when compared to annualized adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2024. \n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company will host an investor conference call at 9:00 a.m. EDT to discuss the results.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to possible or assume future results of our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, plans and objectives. You can generally identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections regarding future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (333-278629) (the “Registration Statement”), and elsewhere in the Registration Statement. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: the economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate; our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings of such strategies and actions; our ability to recruit and retain qualified driving associates, independent contractors and third-party auto transportation and logistics companies; an increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or other claims; our expectations regarding the successful implementation of the Combinations; geopolitical developments and additional changes in international trade policies and relations; the effect of any international conflicts or terrorist activities, on the United States and global economies in general, the transportation industry, or us in particular, and what effects these events will have on our costs and the demand for our services; our ability to manage our network capacity and cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses, and match it to shifting and future customer volume levels; our ability to compete effectively against current and future competitors; our ability to maintain our profitability despite quarterly fluctuations in our results, whether due to seasonality, large cyclical events, or other causes; and our future financial and operating results; our expectations regarding the period during which we will qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act; and our use of the net proceeds from the IPO and the sufficiency of our existing cash to fund our future operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements. \n\nThe forward-looking statements made in this document relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\n**Appendix**\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure**\n\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). However, management believes that EBITDA provides useful information in measuring our operating performance, generating future operating plans and making strategic decisions regarding allocation of capital.

Welcome to the Proficient Auto\nLogistics First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be\nadvised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the\nconference over to your speaker today, Brad Wright, Chief Financial Officer. Please go\nahead.\nBrad Wright^ Thank you, Shannon [ph], and good morning, everybody. I'm Brad\nWright, Chief Financial Officer of Proficient Auto Logistics. Thank you for joining us on\nProficient's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.\nAs you probably know, on May 13, 2024, we completed our initial public offering and\nthe combination of our five founding companies. Under SEC rules, we are required to file\nfirst quarter financial statements for Proficient Auto Logistics, the designated accounting\nacquirer of each of the founding companies, and Proficient Auto Transport, the\ndesignated accounting predecessor to the company.\nThese financial statements will be filed on a Form 10-Q later this week. We are not\nrequired to provide, and the Form 10-Q will not contain pro forma financial data for the\nfirst quarter. However, our earnings release provided summary unaudited combined\nfinancial information for the first quarter for the five founding companies.\nOur earnings release can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at\nproficientautologistics.com. Our 10-Q, when filed, can also be found under the Investor\nRelations section of our website. During this call, we will be discussing certain forward-\nlooking information.\nThis information is based on our current expectations and is not a guarantee of future\nperformance. I encourage you to review the cautionary statement in our earnings release\ndescribing factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed by the\nforward-looking statements. Further information can be found in our SEC filings.\nDuring this call, we may also be referring to EBITDA. Please refer to the portions of our\nearnings release that provide a reconciliation of EBITDA to GAAP measures such as\nearnings before income taxes or net income.\nJoining me on today's call are Rick O'Dell, Proficient's Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and Randy Beggs, our President and Chief Operating Officer. We will provide a\ncompany update as well as an overview of the company's combined results for the first\nquarter.\nAfter our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to questions. During the Q&A, please\nlimit yourself to one question, plus one follow-up. You may then get back into the queue\nif you have additional questions. Now, I would like to introduce Rick O'Dell, who will\nprovide the company update. Rick?\nRichard O'Dell^ Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. The closing of our IPO\nand the founding company acquisitions on May 13th represented the culmination of\nsignificant efforts over the past year by everyone from the transaction organizers to the\nmanagement teams of Proficient Auto Logistics and each of the five founding companies,\nour legal and investment banking teams, and of course the investors who did the analysis\nand showed their interest and confidence in our story to become the holders of equity in\nour new combined enterprise.\nWhile we were pleased with the accomplishment of completing those transactions, it\nmerely marks the beginning of the real work in front of us to execute against the plan that\nwe described to investors in the lead-up to our IPO. There are many initiatives requiring\nexecution over the near-to-intermediate term, but we are particularly focused on five.\nCost synergies. The enhanced national scale afforded by our combination provides\nleverage in our procurement efforts that is expected to reap immediate benefits in our\noperating ratio. Within 10 days of closing our transactions, we had implemented an\nimproved fuel contract with a national provider. We expect the savings to equal or exceed\n$3 million on an annualized basis.\nIncreased utilization. The reduction of empty miles across our network may well be the\nhighest impact initiative on our operating ratios over time. To that end, we are currently\nin the process of implementing our common transportation management system at the\nfourth of our five founding companies. We expect all five companies to be active on this\nsystem during the third quarter.\nIn the meantime, our management teams are evaluating high-volume lanes with typically\nempty backhaul and sharing loads to fill these miles as often as possible. This will be an\nongoing effort and will become increasingly efficient as the TMS systems get integrated.\nIncreasing company deliveries. Improving our operating ratio by shifting more units and\nrevenue to company trucks versus subhaulers is an initiative that not only improves the\nprofitability of existing lanes, it also provides more opportunities to increase our\nutilization efforts as described previously. We've developed a fleet plan for the remainder\nof 2024 that will result in an increase of approximately 10% in company-owned asset.\nThese new units will be put immediately to use covering newly contracted business and\nalso to reduce the subhaul activity in select lanes where we can improve our efficiency\nand profitability.\nActivity-based cost analysis. We have initiated implementation of a third-party software\nthat is transportation-specific and provides profitability by customer, delivery, lane, and\neven down to the truck level. Full implementation will take six to nine months but will\nallow for much higher precision in our profit analysis and our contract bidding process.\nUsed car and fleet marketing. Our marketing team is in place nationally and has begun\nbuilding the relationships in each geographic market that will allow us to grow this\nlargely untapped revenue potential.\nFrom an operating perspective, we've been in active communication with our OEM\ncustomers describing the impact of our recent combination on our ability to deliver\nincreased geographic coverage and the availability of increased and enhanced service\ncapability that the new structure provide.\nAs we noted in our earnings release earlier this morning, we experienced reduced demand\nearly in the first quarter. However, volumes began showing improvement around the\nmiddle of February and have continued to strengthen since then. In addition, our\ncompanies continue to add new contract business with nine net new contracts between\nthe beginning of 2024 and the end of May. There were also 13 renewals of existing\ncontracts during that time span.\nWhile our primary focus is the integration and growth of the founding companies, we\nalso continue to see a number of interesting strategic opportunities, and in each case,\nwe'll evaluate their potential for accelerating the achievement of our coverage and\nprofitability goals. We are encouraged about the prospects for continued growth over the\ncoming months and look forward to providing you with another update when we report\nthe second quarter results. I will now turn it back to Brad to cover key financial\nhighlights.\nBrad Wright^ Thank you, Rick. I'll start by reiterating some of the highlights that we\ncalled out in the earnings press release early this morning.\nAll financial references are for the combined founding companies. Operating income of\n6.5 million in the first quarter was an increase of 7.9% over the same period in 2023.\nOperating ratio improved from 94.1% in the first quarter of '23 to 93.2% in 2024. Income\nbefore taxes of 5.4 million in the first quarter was an increase of 12.1%. These\nprofitability measures are up in spite of an approximately 5% decline in revenue before\nfuel surcharge.\nAs we also noted, the lower customer demand during the first quarter fell\ndisproportionately to the dedicated fleet business, which is geared for resolution of excess\ninventory hotspots.\nWhile that portion of our business represented approximately 15% of total revenue before\nfuel surcharge in 2023, it comprised approximately 7% of total revenue in the first\nquarter of this year. On units delivered basis, the dedicated fleet business comprised 3.7%\nof total units in 2023 and 2.1% of all units delivered in 2024. The disparity in these two\nmeasures reflects the fact that this business is billed [ph] by the hour rather than by units.\nRemoving the impact of the dedicated fleet business, total units delivered increased by\n3.7% year-over-year, and revenue per unit delivered increased from $180 per unit to $184\nper unit, or approximately 2%.\nAs it relates to the balance sheet, on May 13th, we closed on the initial public offering of\n14,333,333 shares of our common stock at $15 per share. On June 4, the company sold an\nadditional 1,435,000 shares of our common stock through a partial exercise of the\nunderwriter's range new [ph] option, also at a price of $15 per share.\nAs we've previously disclosed, a significant portion of the IPO proceeds were used in the\npurchase of the five founding companies. Net of underwriter's fees and other transaction\nexpenses, and the cash portion of the combination purchase price, the combined company\nhad approximately $40 million of remaining cash and equivalents available for future\noperations and other strategic opportunities.\nAggregate long-term debt, predominantly for the financing of revenue-generated\nequipment, totaled approximately $56 million following the combinations, for a net debt\nposition of approximately $16 million. Total common shares outstanding are $26.1\nmillion. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator^ Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of\nBruce Chan with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBruce Chan^ Thank you, operator, and good morning, gentlemen. Great to get some\nconfirmation here with these results that the predecessor business is in good shape, but\nobviously, investors are going to be a little bit more focused on the post-deal results. And,\nRick, you already gave us some great color on that process so far, but it sounds like there\nmay be a couple of, I'd say, new developments here, and I just want to make sure that I\nhave those right.\nSo, first of all, you've got that fuel savings program and the $3 million in annual savings.\nI know, you talked about that possibility around the IPO, but it was not in our model. Is it\nsafe to say that those savings are now in the bag at this point?\nRichard O'Dell^ Yes. Yes, that's under contract, and it's progressing.\nBruce Chan^ That's great to hear. And then, it sounds like that activity-based cost\nanalysis program, maybe a little bit faster to inure and maybe more meaningful than we'd\ninitially thought. Is there a good way to think about, how that benefits the model, whether\nit's on the pricing side or the cost side?\nRichard O'Dell^ I think it's a little bit of both, on the -- the analytics are very good on the\npricing side with the new system, and, we're lacking a little bit of sophistication in some\nof the founding companies with our pricing analytics, so it'll be a really nice\nenhancement. And then, furthermore, once you have the profitability by lane, then you\ncan kind of target market and know what you're going after business that operates well.\nBruce Chan^ Okay, great. That's good to hear. And then, maybe just for my follow-up,\nand then I'll turn it over and get back in the queue. On the units delivered, you had\n$460,000 in the first quarter. Brad, maybe if you have a monthly ramp on that number,\njust given some of the disruption earlier in the quarter. And I know you're still dealing\nwith some of that residual strike drag.\nAnd then, when you think about that result, how do those compare to your model? And\njust, given some of the news around recent star numbers, how are you feeling about\ncurrent volume trends?\nBrad Wright^ Yes. The trends in the second quarter today have been very positive. We're\ntrending up about 10% quarter to date in the second quarter, which is obviously a lot of --\na big step up from the first quarter.\nBruce Chan^ Okay, perfect. That's good to hear. Appreciate it, and I'll hop back into\nqueue.\nBrad Wright^ And I would just comment, too, on the volume side. So, I think it's\nencouraging to see we've actually signed nine new contracts since the combination was\nannounced. So, we continue to see good reception from customers to the combined entity.\nBruce Chan^ Okay, great. Appreciate that color.\nOperator^ Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of\nRyan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nRyan Merkel^ Hey, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up on the quarter to\ndate revenue of 10%. How did things look sort of February, March, April?\nRichard O'Dell^ That was just for clarity, that was units, not revenue.\nRyan Merkel^ Got it. Can you just talk about how the volumes improved since February\nand sort of where we're at, sort of May, June timeframe, if we've seen a lift?\nBrad Wright^ Yes. So Ryan, this is Brad. So, I think Bruce asked the question, too, in\nterms of January versus the remainder of the month. So, in January, or I should say, let's\njust say in February versus January, we were up about 15% month over month and then\nkind of maintained that same pace in March. As we get into April, much more strength,\nup probably, I think Rick mentioned 11% and we've maintained that through the end of\nMay.\nSo, really good strength, once you get to basically mid-February, year-over-year\nincreases have been in the low double digits.\nRyan Merkel^ Okay. Got it. And then can we talk about price? I think it was 2% in the\nquarter. Should we expect that to be trending up through the rest of the year as some of\nthe new contracts come on?\nBrad Wright^ Yes. Well, you're going to see -- you'll see it even in the second quarter\nthat price is up and that's not necessarily all, new contracts. It's some, renewals and I\nthink Rick mentioned that we've got net new contracts that added to the business mix in\nthe form of about nine net new. But yes, you'll see the overall price and revenue numbers\nmoving north even in the second quarter.\nRyan Merkel^ Got it. Great to hear. I'll pass it on. Thanks.\nRichard O'Dell^ Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator^ Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Bruce Chan with Stifel.\nYour line is now open.\nBruce Chan^ Yes, appreciate the double dip here. Just, maybe a follow-up on some of\nthat line of questioning. Just want to know if there have been any customer concerns\nexpressed post-deal as a result of the consolidation? It sounds like from the nine new\ncontracts and the 13 renewals that the answer is that it actually may have been a boon for\nyou, but just want to hear if there's been any pushback on the combination here.\nRichard O'Dell^ No, it's been well received by the customer base. They like the\ncommitment to capacity, company trucks, the coverage area that we have, and the service\nthat the five founding companies have been providing continues to be enhanced by some\nof our technology implementations. So, it's been well received. We haven't really had any\nnegative feedback.\nBruce Chan^ Okay, great. That's good to hear. And then just maybe one final one here\nthat's sort of a prospective question. But, just given the upcoming election, I'm wondering\nif any customers have discussed their expectations around what potential tariffs could\nlook like and how that would impact the business. I know, again, that's somewhat of a\nhypothetical, but if you had any thoughts there, that would be helpful.\nRichard O'Dell^ No, it hasn't really been a topic.\nBruce Chan^ Okay. Hopefully, we don't have to worry about that.\nRichard O'Dell^ Yes, right.\nOperator^ Thank you. And I'm currently show no further questions at this time. This\ndoes conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may\nnow disconnect."

Welcome to the Proficient Auto\nLogistics Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Please be\nadvised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Brad Wright, Chief\nFinancial Officer. Please go ahead.\nBrad Wright^ Good morning, everybody. I'm Brad Wright, Chief Financial Officer of\nProficient Auto Logistics. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2024 earnings call.\nUnder SEC rules, our Form 10-Q, which we expect to file early next week, covering three\nand six-month periods ending June 30, 2024, include financial statements from both the\npredecessor accounting entity, Proficient Auto Transport, and the successor entity, Proficient\nAuto Logistics, Inc.\nWe are not required to provide, and the Form 10-Q will not contain, proforma financial data\nfor the second quarter. However, our earnings release provides comparative summary,\nunaudited, combined financial information for the second quarter for the five founding\ncompanies.\nOur earnings release can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at\nproficientautologistics.com. Our 10-Q, when filed, can also be found under the Investor\nRelations section of our website.\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain forward-looking information. This information\nis based on our current expectations and is not a guarantee of future performance. I encourage\nyou to review the cautionary statement in our earnings release describing factors that could\ncause actual results to differ from those expressed in our forward-looking statements.\nFurther information can be found in our SEC filings. During this call, we also may be\nreferring to measures that include adjusted operating income, EBITDA, and adjusted\nEBITDA. Please refer to the portions of our earnings release that provide reconciliations of\nthose profitability measures to GAAP measures such as operating earnings and earnings\nbefore income taxes or net income.\nJoining me on today's call are Rick O'Dell, Proficient's Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer; and Randy Beggs, our President and Chief Operating Officer. We will provide a\ncompany update as well as an overview of the company's combined results for the first\nquarter. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to questions.\nDuring the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question, plus one follow-up. You may then get\nback into the queue if you have additional questions.\nNow, I would like to introduce Rick O'Dell, who will provide the company update.\nRichard O'Dell^ Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. I'll start out with an\noverview of our operations during the second quarter and some trends that provide insight\ninto our expectations for the back half of 2024. I'll follow that with some exciting news about\na strategic addition to Proficient that we expect to close as early as next week.\nWe believe that this is exactly the type of addition described to our investors during the IPO\nprocess. It is large enough to meaningfully increase our scale. It is geographically well placed\nto increase our density in the western United States and brings along best in class\nmanagement and operating profitability.\nFirst, as it relates to the second quarter, as we discussed in our last earnings call, second\nquarter unit volumes and related revenues started off very strong in April and May with year-\nover-year revenue up approximately 11% for that two month period.\nJune however slowed considerably with unit volumes slightly negative versus the same\nmonth of 2023 down less than 1% and revenue for the month was down approximately 8%\nversus the prior year.\nThat trend has continued in July with flat unit volumes versus the same month of 2023 and\ntotal revenue of approximately 11%. There is a seasonal aspect to July as many OEMs select\nto close plants for the week of July the 4th and depending on the environment some even take\nthe opportunity to shutter the plants for a two-week period. This year you can add to that the\nCDK Global software outage at the end of June that slows sales volumes during a typically\nstrong holiday week.\nIn keeping with the trend, we're observing many of the major auto manufacturers have used\ntheir second quarter earnings reports to temper second half volume guidance in the face of a\nweaker than expected volumes last quarter.\nReferences to high inventory that dealership lots declining profitability metrics and planned\ncost cutting measures were common theme. We're mindful of guidance from our primary\ncustomers as we assess our projections for the remainder of the year and Brad will provide\nsome additional detail in that regard with his comments.\nOur primary means of countering some current industry headwinds will come in the form of\nincreasing market share. We noted in our previous earnings call the addition of nine net new\ncontracts in ‘24 through the end of May, an additional five new contracts were acquired\nduring June and July.\nIn addition there were three contracts renewed with significant expansion of allocated lanes.\nThe precise impact on the revenue of these additions is dependent on the volume ultimately\ngenerated by the respective OEMs. But our coverage network and quality service is clearly\nbeing well received in the marketplace.\nNow, a little color on our strategic acquisition. We're very excited to announce this morning\nthe anticipated closing of our acquisition of Auto Transport Group. We've been extremely\nimpressed with the team at ATG and the high quality business they've built over the last 25\nyears, and we're enthusiastic about the prospect of adding them to the existing foundation of\nproficient auto logistics.\nJust to give you an idea of the scale they'll add to our platform, ATG controls a fleet of over\n100 vehicles with approximately 80% of those being company owned. The equipment has an\naverage age of about 5.5 years which is consistent with the existing fleet at Proficient.\nEmployee base is approximately 80 personnel with roughly 75% being drivers. ATG has\ndelivered approximately 200,000 autos annually in recent years and is expected to add about\n8% to our revenue growth over the next year.\nThey operate at margins consistent with the best of our founding companies and are expected\nto be immediately accreted to earnings per share. We'll be hearing more about this addition\nnext quarter following the official closing of the transaction.\nI'll now turn it back over to Brad to cover some key financial highlights.\nBrad Wright^ Thank you, Rick. I'll start by reiterating a few of the highlights that we called\nout in the earnings press release earlier this morning. All financial references are for the\ncombined founding companies. Operating revenue of $106.6 million in the quarter was an\nincrease of 5.8%. Adjusted operating ratio improved from 92.7% in the second quarter of\n2023 to 91.8% in 2024. This was also an improvement from 93.2% in the first quarter of this\nyear.\nAdjusted operating income was $8.7 million in the most recent quarter, up 19.4% from $7.3\nmillion in the second quarter last year. The adjusted profitability measures add back the\nimpact of stock compensation expense resulting from RSU Grants made concurrent with our\nIPO, which are expensed over the vesting period, in most cases three years.\nThe other expense added back in these measures is amortization of intangible assets resulting\nfrom the acquisitions of the founding companies. Amortizable intangibles consist primarily of\ntrade names and customer relationships which you can expect to add approximately $2\nmillion per quarter to operating expenses. These are both non-cash expense items that are\nremoved from our operating metrics to provide a clearer picture of the progress that we're\nachieving in our integration and synergy initiatives.\nFollowing up to Rick's comments about the environment, we came into the current year\nmodeling approximately 8% revenue growth for the full year, with about equal parts coming\nfrom volume and price. The recent trends experienced in June and July have prompted us to\nreassess the outlook for the second half of 2024. We're now expecting sequential quarter\nrevenue growth in the mid-single digits for the third quarter, with adjusted operating ratio that\nis consistent with last quarter.\nThe fourth quarter typically exhibits seasonal strength. That, along with a full quarter of\nincluding ATG in our results, we are expecting sequential quarter revenue growth of low\ndouble digits in the fourth quarter. The adjusted operating ratio is expected to improve by 50\nto 100 basis points sequentially in the fourth quarter.\nAs relates to the balance sheet, the company had approximately $36 million of cash in\nequivalents on June 30, 2024. Aggregate debt balances a quarter end were approximately $55\nmillion for net debt of $19 million.\nOur fleet plan calls for approximately $20 million of growth CapEx during the remainder of\n2024, the vast majority of which will be financed at market rates through existing lender\nrelationships.\nFinally, the ATG acquisition will be done at a multiple and a mix of stock and cash, roughly\nin line with the acquisitions of the five founding companies. Our approach to financing\nequipment CapEx and a portion of the ATG purchase will leave plenty of liquidity available\nfor other opportunities, whether operational or strategic, and leverage will remain below 2\ntimes EBITDA.\nTotal common shares outstanding are currently $26.1 million. As disclosed in a Form 8-K\nfiled earlier this morning, we expect to issue approximately 1 million shares in connection\nwith the acquisition of ATG.\nOperator, we will now take questions.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator^ Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of\nBruce Chan with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBruce Chan^ Thank you, operator. And good morning, guys. Some exciting results here.\nCertainly appreciate the time. Maybe just to start, I wanted to follow up on your comments\nabout the monthly revenue trends. Certainly understand some of the puts and takes here with\nregard to the lower, auto volumes and OEM activates. But it looks like maybe there was some\nassociated and more pronounced yield impact there too.\nCan you maybe just, walk us through what those headwinds were to the yield that kind of\ncame on top of those volume pressures?\nRichard O'Dell^ So it's kind of a combination with the volume. In our industry, spot moves\ntend to be when people have backlogs and they come at premium rates. So when you have a\nsofter volume environment, we have less of those kind of spot moves that are at a premium.\nSo that was really the impact.\nWe have our numbers on, if you exclude some of our dedicated fleet, the revenue per unit\nwas actually up about 3% on our contractual business, so.\nBruce Chan^ Okay. That's super helpful. And then just, turning to the operating ratio,\ncertainly a much faster OR improvement than we'd been modeling. And just maybe you want\nto dive into that a little bit.\nWhat are you seeing there as far as levers? I know you talked about some of the synergies.\nBut, can you maybe just give us some color on what opportunities you have on the efficiency\nside, especially as you start to think about a little bit of the top line pressure for the next, few\nmonths here?\nRichard O'Dell^ Yes, we still have a high degree of confidence in our key synergy and\noperating improvement initiatives. To be honest with you, those really, weren't in place\nduring this quarter. We have a little bit of benefit from purchasing synergies on fuel, but\nwe've only had that for about one month in the quarter. It was about $300,000.\nThen it's really more from implementing best practices and seeing a good cooperation\nbetween our operating companies, in terms of sharing freight and minimizing backhaul\nopportunities, which were the ones we anticipated being able to move most quickly on.\nBruce Chan^ Okay. That's great. And then maybe, sorry.\nRichard O'Dell^ I was just going to say the major operating improvements are still ahead of\nus.\nBruce Chan^ Got it. And then just one more quick one, and I'll hop back in queue. But as far\nas that IT process is concerned, are we now fully integrated at this point with all the OPCOs?\nRichard O'Dell^ So we have four of the five implemented, and we've actually intentionally\ndelayed the fifth of the companies to kind of simplify the integration with the implementation\nof the new accounting system. But we're very much on track.\nBruce Chan^ Okay. Perfect, thank you.\nRichard O'Dell^ With all the implementations.\nBrad Wright^ Bruce, the accounting system and the fifth company on the TMS are scheduled\nto happen on October 1st.\nBruce Chan^ Okay. Great. Appreciate that, color.\nOperator^ Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William\nBlair. Your line is now open.\nRyan Merkel^ Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. My first question is\njust on the revenue guide for 3Q. I think you said up mid-single digits sequentially. Can you,\ngive us the assumptions you're making about what you'll see in August and September? Did\nyou sort of extrapolate what you saw in July, or are you thinking there might be a bit of\nimprovement?\nBrad Wright^ I think there's going to be improvement in the last two months of the quarter,\nRyan, because as Rick mentioned in his comments, you had some plant closures in July. We\ngot off to a slow start with some of the issues around the CDK outage.\nI just think there were a couple of unique factors that probably exacerbated lower volumes in\nJuly and so we are expecting a little bit of an uptick which is how we get to still an up quarter\nover quarter. But the bigger increases are to come in Q4 I believe.\nRyan Merkel^ And then to follow up on that, the Q4 increase sequentially you mentioned\nseasonality is that the only assumption or is there any assumptions on better volumes or better\npricing?\nBrad Wright^ It's a combination of seasonality and I mentioned that we also expect that we'll\nhave a full quarter of ATG revenue in there and that's part of the increase as well.\nRyan Merkel^ Got it, good point okay. And then you mentioned that CDK issue did can you\nquantify that. Was that an impact in the quarter and is it better now just a little color on that\nwould be helpful?\nBrad Wright^ I think, short answer is no. We can't really quantify that, but in kind of reading\nbetween the lines when you listen to the OEMs earnings releases there were multiple\nreferences to kind of excess inventory or high inventory anyway on dealership lots and I\nthink that's part of the -- that was part of the issue, and that just kind of backs everything up.\nRyan Merkel^ Yes makes sense. All right thanks for the time. Pass it on.\nOperator^ Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of\nTyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nTyler Brown^ Hey good morning guys. Can you hear me?\nRichard O'Dell^ Yes.\nTyler Brown^ Oh sorry. Hey just, Brad, I just want to before we get into the Q&A just want\nto level set. So just given the timing of the IPO you guys are only providing kind of high-\nlevel metrics here in Q2 because the Q's details will be really on the predecessor is that right?\nBut by the time we report Q3 we should be getting a full P&L cash flow balance sheet\noperating metrics with the release is that correct?\nBrad Wright^ That's right Tyler. What you're going to see in the Q we filed probably\nTuesday next week is you're going to get the combined quarter and balance sheet. You'll have\na full GAAP balance sheet.\nWhat you won't have is a full quarter of operating results because it will be a combination of\nthe predecessor company up until the IPO and then everybody from the IPO to the end of the\nquarter.\nSo it's a little bit of a confusing presentation frankly.\nTyler Brown^ Right but by Q3 things should kind of level out for everybody out there.\nBrad Wright^ Correct. That's right.\nTyler Brown^ Very helpful. Okay. And then Rick, so can you talk a little bit more about the\nATG transaction? How did that deal come together? Had you guys been working on that one\nfor a while or was it did it actually spawn given all of the interest around the IPO?\nRichard O'Dell^ Yes I mean they were kind of one of the funnel opportunities and then they\nwere actually marketing the company. So caused us to want to move quickly because it was\nsuch a great fit.\nTyler Brown^ Okay that's so…\nRichard O'Dell^ We have -- we obviously have a pipeline of opportunities, but again this one\nwas such a good fit and such a great management team operating very well. So, as you know,\none of my key priorities when you make an acquisition is first priority is don't mess it up.\nThey are operating well. Kind of leave them alone.\nSo it's not going to require a lot for us to absorb them into our network. We'll continue to\nadvance our key priorities and it just enhances our coverage area and the quality of our group.\nTyler Brown^ Okay. Okay, perfect. Yes, and I would assume this one will also move on to\nthe TMS?\nRichard O'Dell^ Yes, they will.\nTyler Brown^ Okay. And then Randy, just…\nRichard O'Dell^ They have a very robust technology platform, but we'd like to have them on\nthe same platform that we're using for visibility, so -- and that they are clearly capable of\nmanaging the implementation without a lot on our side too, so that's a plus.\nTyler Brown^ Okay. And then maybe kind of to this whole point about visibility in the TMS\nand just Randy, any update on backhaul? Just maybe where were you guys in the quarter\nfrom an empty mile perspective? Just how quickly do you think you can make some\nimprovements on filling up some of those backhauls?\nRichard O'Dell^ Yes, so just the last four weeks we were able to do 352 backhauls that\nreduced empty miles. I don't have the miles in front of me to give you the exact miles on it,\nbut it was 352 backhauls that aided in creating density and reducing empty miles and\nenhancing obviously the revenue on those trucks.\nBrad Wright^ We have the targeted lanes, but quite frankly, we're just doing -- we're\nmanaging it manually right now. We're still working on putting our framework around it, so\nwe can better tie in sales incentives and achieve some of our objectives and be dynamic.\nWhereas if we win new business that creates new empty lanes, then we'll be looking to fill\nthose as opposed to kind of a more static targeted target that we have now that we're doing\nmanually.\nTyler Brown^ Okay. Okay. So, more on to come there.\nBrad Wright^ Correct. Absolutely.\nTyler Brown^ Okay. Just my last one here. I'm kind of curious what the OEM's response has\nbeen to the combination. I mean, you guys mentioned some contract wins, but has the\ncombination led to actual business wins or losses or just what the OEM response has been?\nThanks.\nRichard O'Dell^ So, the overall OEM response has been very positive. We actually have\nseveral of the OEMs that are approaching us to discuss opportunities as opposed to us even\napproaching them. So, I would say yes, it has led to some of the opportunities or at least\nenhanced our chances to win some of those opportunities that we maybe would not have had\nthe same opportunity prior to the five companies coming together.\nTyler Brown^ Okay, all right. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.\nRichard O'Dell^ Thanks Tyler.\nOperator^ Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Paris with Barrington\nResearch. Your line is now open.\nAlex Paris^ Hi guys. Thanks for letting me sneak one in here at the end. Most of the relevant\nquestions have been asked and answered. I just wanted to get maybe a point of clarification\nand talk a little bit about the dedicated fleet business. Since obviously that is more impacted\nin slower volume sort of periods, can you maybe just give us an overview of what the\ndedicated fleet business is and just orders of magnitude. How big it was on a pro forma basis\nin the most recently completed year?\nBrad Wright^ You can talk to what it is? I can do the numbers.\nRichard O'Dell^ Yes, so what it is, is we have a contract for a specific number of trucks in\nthe dedicated fleet that guarantees that that number of trucks will be revenue producing\nduring the terms of that contract, regardless of the volumes or the impact on the economics.\nIt ebbs up and down as the OEM's volumes increase. In that they will ask us to add additional\ntrucks as the volumes and the ground counts gain. And then those additional trucks will ebb\nback down when volumes and ground counts decrease.\nSo for July, with ground counts decreasing, that overflow number of trucks goes down to the\ncontractual level. And then as volumes come back up and the ground counts increase and\npressures begin, then they will ask us to add more trucks into that fleet. So it ebbs up and\ndown based on volume and pressures created by ground counts.\nBrad Wright^ To your point on the, or your question on the numbers, Alex, I mean, in 2023,\nin the second quarter, the dedicated fleet business was about 16.5% of total revenue. In 2024,\nit's only 7% of total revenue, and that was pretty consistent with the first quarter of the year\nas well. So even while we've had a pretty sizable, almost 6% increase in total revenue in Q2,\nthe dedicated fleet business is literally down by half.\nAlex Paris^ That's very helpful. Thank you for that additional color. And then just maybe\nanother similar sort of summary question, and this will be my final question. Since the\nacquisition closed on May 13th, you've done a number of things on the integration of the five\nfounding companies. Software, you've done the fuel contract. Can you just kind of give us a\nsoup to nuts sort of overview on what you've done on integration of the five founding\ncompanies, specifically since, you know, in terms of what systems have been -- where we are\nin that process, essentially. Thank you.\nRichard O'Dell^ Sure. I'll give you a high level, because I could talk an hour about it. But\nfirst of all, system integration for the five companies are now on the TMS. Fifth one is\nscheduled to go live October 1st.\nWe could have done that earlier, but we are turning on October 1st also the finance system, so\nthat all five companies will be on the finance system. It made sense to hold the last operating\nsystem rather than have to do the integration with their old finance software and then three\nand a half weeks later flip it over to the new software. So we made the decision just to hold\nthe TMS transition, that three and a half weeks to ease the finance system transition.\nWe made the decision to hold their TMS transition at three and a half weeks to ease the\nfinance system transition. We have fully integrated the brokerage group and tasked them on\nnot only creating business, but also focusing on backhaul. The two New Jersey companies are\noperating as several of the departments we've merged together already.\nOn the West Coast, we've actually consolidated a couple of the locations down to one. We've\nalso done some additional software integration with the five companies, 10th Street,\nSupervision, just to name a couple of them. So multiple mergers of software. We're beginning\nto merge some of the locations, and we've begun to consolidate some of the departments\nwithin certain companies and certain locations.\nBrad Wright^ Collaboration has been very good and is producing some results. So, we're\nhappy to see it.\nAlex Paris^ Absolutely. It sounds like you've got a lot of work under your belt already. And\nthen, from a cost synergies perspective, we have the fuel contract renegotiated. But as you\nsaid, most of this stuff is going to come over the next year or so, year to 18 months, I think\nyou said in the press release.\nRichard O'Dell^ Correct.\nAlex Paris^ Thanks, guys.\nRichard O'Dell^ (Multiple Speakers) to kind of gather the data on parts and maintenance\nproviders, etcetera, and get the coordination in place as opposed to fuel process was kind of\nthe first one we'd identified. And again, we're progressing that, but it's not fully implemented\nyet, so we'll see that in future results as well.\nAlex Paris^ Great. Well, thank you very much, guys.\nRichard O'Dell^ Thank you.\nOperator^ Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Your\nline is now open.\nBruce Chan^ Great. Thanks for the double dip here. Just a couple of follow-ups. I wanted to\nfirst pick up on Ryan's question about the assumptions behind the guide. We've been hearing\na little bit more about some upcoming ILA negotiations and the potential impact there,\nespecially on the East Coast. Is there anything baked into the guidance on that front? And\nmaybe you could just speak to any conversations you've had about positioning with your\ncustomers ahead of a potential labor disruption and what that could mean for your operations,\nwhether that's positive or negative.\nRichard O'Dell^ Bruce, I wouldn't say there was anything specific to that, that goes into the\nassumptions, but I mean, anything in conversation?\nBrad Wright^ No.\nRichard O'Dell^ No? I mean, if there were a major labor disruption, that would be\nunfavorable for us.\nBruce Chan^ Okay. But you wouldn't see any associated benefit to pricing, for example, as\ncustomers need to divert maybe to different geographies?\nBrad Wright^ Yes. There could be an opportunity there for the creation of overflow with the\nnecessity for them to divert to different locations.\nRichard O'Dell^ Yes, and pay at spot rates.\nBrad Wright^ Pay spot rates on it, yes.\nBruce Chan^ Got it. Okay, that's really helpful. And then just the last follow-up here. Rick, I\nwanted to clarify some of your comments around the fuel savings. The plan that you're\ntalking about now, that's the kind of original $3 million in annualized savings that you talked\nabout last quarter, and that's on the company fleet. Does that include any opportunity there to\nroll out that fuel program to the sub-hauler fleet? And if so, you know, what could the\ntimeline or the impact look like there?\nRichard O'Dell^ Yes, we're exploring that, but we don't -- that would require some\nincremental technology and process implementations for us to do that, but the savings are\npotentially material, it would probably go up by at least 50%.\nBruce Chan^ Okay, got it. So that's completely incremental to the current program that\nyou've been talking about?\nRichard O'Dell^ It would be.\nBruce Chan^ Great. Okay, super helpful. Thank you for the follow-up.\nRichard O'Dell^ Okay.\nOperator^ Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. Thank you for your\nparticipation. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\nRichard O'Dell^ I have one more comment if you don't mind.\nOperator^ Sure.\nRichard O'Dell^ So just in terms of commenting on the accretion from the ATG acquisition,\nI guess the way to look at it, because we really talk about it on an annualized basis is, you\nknow, the midpoint of the consensus estimates for next year are $1.30, and on an annualized\nbasis we would expect the ATG acquisition to be accreted by about $0.25. So just to give you\nsome scale of what the impact of the accretion would be.\nThat's all I have. Thank you very much for your interest.\nOperator^ Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your\nparticipation. You may now disconnect."

The Board’s recommendations are based on its determination (using advice and\ninformation supplied by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) as to the\nsuitability of each individual, and the slate as a whole, to serve as directors of Proficient, taking\ninto account the membership criteria discussed below.\nThe Board may fill vacancies in existing or new director positions. Directors so appointed\nby the Board will serve until the next election of directors unless elected by the stockholders to a\nfurther term.\nBoard Membership Criteria\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee works with the Board on an annual\nbasis to determine the appropriate characteristics, skills and experience for the Board as a whole and\nits individual members. While the selection of qualified directors is a complex, subjective process\nthat requires consideration of many intangible factors, directors and candidates for director\ngenerally should, at a minimum, meet the following criteria:\n Directors and candidates should have high personal and professional ethics, integrity,\nvalues and character and be committed to representing the interests of the Company and\nits stockholders;\n Directors and candidates should have experience and a successful track record at senior\npolicy-making levels in business, government, technology, accounting, law and/or\nadministration;\nPage 1 of 8\n766012926.1\n Directors and candidates should have sufficient time to devote to the affairs of the\nCompany and to enhance their knowledge of the Company’s business, operations and\nindustry; and\n Directors and candidates should have expertise or a breadth of knowledge about issues\naffecting the Company that is useful to the Company and complementary to the background\nand experience of other Board members.\nThe Board of Directors assesses diversity in its broadest sense and considers the\nbackgrounds, experiences and viewpoints of its members and director candidates. When\nidentifying candidates for director, the Board endeavors to search for highly qualified women and\nindividuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which directors are chosen.\nElection of Directors\nThe Board expects a director to tender his or her resignation if he or she fails to receive the\naffirmative vote of a majority of the votes present and voting at the meeting voting on directors.\nThe Board shall nominate for election or re-election as director only candidates who agree to\ntender, promptly following the annual meeting at which they are elected or re-elected as director,\nirrevocable resignations that will be effective upon (i) the failure to receive the required vote at the\nnext annual meeting at which they will face re-election and (ii) Board acceptance of such\nresignation. In addition, the Board shall fill director vacancies and new directorships only with\ncandidates who agree to tender, promptly following their appointment to the Board, the same form\nof resignation tendered by other directors in accordance with this Guideline.\nIf an incumbent director fails to receive the required vote for re-election, the Nominating\nand Corporate Governance Committee will act on an expedited basis to determine whether to\naccept the director’s resignation and will submit such recommendation for prompt consideration\nby the Board. The Board expects the director whose resignation is under consideration to abstain\nfrom participating in any decision regarding that resignation. The Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee and the Board may consider any factors they deem relevant in deciding\nwhether to accept a director’s resignation.\nDirector Responsibilities\nDirectors should exercise their business judgment to act in what they reasonably believe to\nbe in the best interests of the Company in a manner consistent with their fiduciary duties. Directors\nshould regularly attend meetings of the Board of Directors and of all Board committees upon which\nthey serve. To prepare for meetings, directors should review the materials that are sent to directors\nin advance of those meetings.\nThe Board of Directors of the Company will schedule regular executive sessions where\nnonmanagement directors (i.e., directors who are not Company officers but who do not otherwise\nhave to qualify as “independent” directors) meet without management participation. At each\nregular meeting of the Board of Directors, the Board will conduct an executive session where only\nPage 2 of 8\n766012926.1\nindependent directors meet without the participation of management or other nonemployee\ndirectors.\nBoard Composition - Director Independence\nThe Board believes that, except during periods of temporary vacancies, a majority of its\ndirectors must be independent. In determining the independence of a director, the Board will apply\nthe definition of “independent director” in the Nasdaq Stock Market rules, as such requirements\nare interpreted by the Board in its business judgment, and other applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding, based on applicable director committee assignments, Section 10A of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10A-3 promulgated thereunder, and Section 10C of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10C-1 promulgated thereunder. The\nBoard must also determine that a director otherwise has no material relationship with the\nCompany, either directly, or as an officer, stockholder or partner of an organization that has a\nrelationship with Proficient. In each case, the Board will consider all relevant facts and\ncircumstances.\nTerm Limits\nThe Board believes that non-employee directors who have served on the Board for ten\nyears, should be required to resign from the Board for at least two years. After a non-employee\ndirector has been off the Board for two years following the completion of four full three-year\nterms, he or she will again be eligible to be evaluated for membership on the Board. Time served\non the Board prior to the completion of Proficient’s initial public offering will not be counted\nagainst a non- employee director’s limit of four full three-year terms. The Board believes that term\nlimits will help ensure that there are fresh ideas and viewpoints available to the Board.\nRetirement Policy\nThe Board believes that it should evaluate the abilities and contributions of each director\naccording to the process described above, and does not believe it should fix a retirement age for\ndirectors.\nDirectors with Significant Job Changes\nThe Board believes that any director who retires from his or her present employment, or who\nmaterially changes his or her principal occupation or business, should promptly tender a written\nresignation to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would then evaluate\nwhether the Board should accept the resignation based on a review of whether the director continues\nto satisfy the Board’s membership criteria in light of his or her changed status. At the first Board\nmeeting held after the meeting where such letter is received, the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee would recommend to the Board whether to accept or decline the resignation.\nSelection of Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer\nPage 3 of 8\n766012926.1\nThe Board selects Proficient’s Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer in the manner that\nit determines to be in the best interests of Proficient’s stockholders.

In the event the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee concludes that such new relationship raises any potentially significant legal, regulatory,\ncompetitive or reputational concerns for Proficient, the director shall either not enter into such new\nrelationship or shall resign as a director of Proficient.\nConflicts of Interest\nAll directors must comply with the applicable provisions of Proficient’s Code of Business\nConduct. If an actual or potential conflict of interest develops for any reason, including, without\nlimitation, because of a change in the business operations of Proficient or a subsidiary, or in a\ndirector’s circumstances, the director should immediately report such matter to the Company’s chief\nlegal officer for evaluation. The chief legal officer will have the discretion to report any or all such\nactual or potential conflicts to the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nfor review and determination of the director’s continued qualification for membership on the Board\nbut is required to report to the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee all\nsuch conflicts that are material. For purposes of this policy, an actual or potential conflict of interest\nis considered to be material if it would require proxy statement disclosure as a related party\ntransaction or if it involves a relationship with a competitor of Proficient. If a significant conflict\ncannot be resolved, the director may be required to resign.\nIf a director has a personal interest in a matter before the Board, the director must disclose\nthe interest to the Board, excuse himself or herself from participation in the discussion, and not\nvote on the matter.\nPage 4 of 8\n766012926.1\nBoard Meetings; Involvement of Senior Management\nAgendas and Meetings\nThe Chairperson, if other than the Chief Executive Officer, or the lead independent\ndirector, with consultation from the Chief Executive Officer and the Corporate Secretary, shall set\nthe agenda for each Board meeting, and will distribute this agenda in advance to each director.

          "content": "Proficient Auto Logistics, Inc.\nCode of Business Conduct\nMay 6, 2024\n766012177.1\nCODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT1\nPurpose\nThis Code of Business Conduct (this “Code”) of Proficient Auto Logistics, Inc.\n(“Proficient”) summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the business\nconduct of Proficient and also provides a set of basic principles to guide Covered Persons (as\ndefined below) regarding the minimum ethical requirements expected of them. This Code\nsupplements Proficient’s existing employee policies and also supplements various other codes of\nethics, policies and procedures that have been adopted by Proficient or its subsidiaries. All Covered\nPersons are expected to become familiar with this Code and to apply these principles in the daily\nperformance of their jobs.\nOverview\nThis Code is applicable to all employees, officers, directors, and temporary/contract\nemployees of Proficient and all of its U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively,\n“Covered Persons”).\nProficient is committed to uphold ethical standards in all of its corporate and business\nactivities. All Covered Persons are expected to perform their work with honesty, truthfulness and\nintegrity and to comply with the general principles set forth in this Code. Covered Persons are also\nexpected to perform their work with honesty and integrity in any areas not specifically addressed\nby this Code.\nIt is the responsibility of all Covered Persons to maintain a work environment that fosters\nintegrity, respect and fairness. Proficient requires all Covered Persons to conduct themselves in a\nlawful, honest and ethical manner in all of Proficient’s business practices.\nAll Covered Persons are expected to seek the advice of a supervisor, a manager, the Human\nResources Department, or, the Legal Department for additional guidance or if there is any question\nabout issues discussed in this Code.\nIf any Covered Person observes possible unethical or illegal conduct, such concerns or\ncomplaints should be reported as set forth in “Reporting Violations of this Code” below.\nFor the purposes of this Code, the term “Executive Officer” shall mean those officers of\nProficient, as shall be determined by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) from time to time, who\nare subject to the reporting obligations of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended. For purposes of this Code, the term “Director” shall mean a member of the Board of\nDirectors of Proficient.\nCompliance with Applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations\n766012177.1 Page 2 of 13\nCompliance with Applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations\nAll Covered Persons of Proficient are required to comply with all of the applicable laws,\nrules and regulations of the United States and other countries, and the states, counties, cities and\nother jurisdictions, in which Proficient conducts its business, although traffic violations and other\nminor offenses will not be considered violations of this Code. Local laws may in some instances\nbe less restrictive than the principles set forth in this Code. In those situations, Covered Persons\nshould comply with this Code, even if the conduct would otherwise be legal under applicable laws.\nOn the other hand, if local laws are more restrictive than this Code, Covered Persons should\ncomply with applicable laws. Although it is not expected that all Covered Persons will know the\ndetails of these laws, rules and regulations, it is important for all Covered Persons to seek advice\non compliance with any laws, rules and regulations if any questions regarding compliance arise.\nTrading in Proficient Securities\nTrading in Proficient securities based on inside information is both unethical and illegal.\nGenerally, persons who have material non-public information about Proficient are not permitted\nto buy, sell or otherwise trade in Proficient securities. This restriction extends to tipping others\nabout or sharing with others such material non-public information, since individuals receiving such\ninformation might use it to trade in Proficient securities.\nProficient has adopted an Insider Trading Policy, governing trading in Proficient securities.\nConflicts of Interest\nAll Covered Persons are required to conduct themselves in a manner and with such ethics\nand integrity so as to avoid a conflict of interest, either real or apparent.\nA “conflict of interest” is any circumstance where an individual’s personal interest\ninterferes with the interests of Proficient. A conflict of interest can arise when a Covered Person\ntakes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her related work\nobjectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also may arise when a Covered Person, or a\nmember of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position\nwith Proficient. Some of the areas where a conflict of interest could arise include:\n Employment by a competitor, regardless of the nature of the employment, while\nemployed by Proficient.\n Placement of business with any firm or organization in which a Covered Person, or\nany member of the Covered Person’s family, has a substantial ownership interest\nor management responsibility.\n Making endorsements or testimonials for third parties.\n Disclosing Proficient’s confidential information to a third party without the prior\nconsent of an Executive Officer.\n766012177.1 Page 3 of 13\nAll questions regarding conflicts of interest and whether a particular situation constitutes a\nconflict of interest should be directed to the Legal Department. See also “Reporting Violations of\nthis Code” below.\nConfidentiality\nCovered Persons are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of information\nentrusted to them as a result of their roles with Proficient, except when disclosure is authorized or\nlegally mandated. The sensitive nature of the investment business requires that Proficient keep its\ncustomers’ confidence and trust. Covered Persons must be continuously sensitive to the\nconfidential and privileged nature of the information to which they have access concerning\nProficient and its customers and customers, and must exercise the utmost discretion when\ndiscussing any work-related matters with third parties. Each Covered Person must safeguard\nProficient’s confidential information and not disclose it to a third party (other than a third party\nhaving a duty of confidentiality to Proficient) without the prior consent of an Executive Officer.\n“Confidential information” includes but is not limited to information, knowledge, ideas,\ndocuments or materials that are owned, developed or possessed by Proficient or that in some other\nfashion are related to confidential or proprietary matters of Proficient, its business, customers,\nshareholders, Covered Persons or brokers. It includes all business, product, marketing, financial,\naccounting, personnel, operations, supplier, technical and research information. It also includes\ncomputer systems, software, documentation, creations, inventions, literary works, developments,\ndiscoveries and trade secrets. Confidential information includes any non-public information of\nProficient that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to Proficient, its customers or\nshareholders, if disclosed.\nAll employees of Proficient are expected to sign an acknowledgment regarding the\nconfidentiality policy set forth above at the time they become employed with Proficient.\nCovered Persons are expected to comply with the confidentiality policy not only for the\nduration of their employment or service with Proficient, but also after the end of their employment\nor service with Proficient.\nAll reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code shall be considered\nconfidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.\nNon-Proficient Business Activities\nCovered Persons, other than Directors who do not also serve in management positions with\nProficient, must obtain prior, written approval from Proficient’s Chief Executive Officer or his/her\ndesignee before accepting an invitation to serve as a director or trustee of another business.\nCovered Persons, other than Directors who do not also serve in management positions with\nProficient, must obtain prior written approval from Proficient’s Chief Executive Officer or his/her\ndesignee before making any investment in a customer, potential customer, or other business entity\nwith which Proficient has or may have dealings, if the employee is in a position to influence\nProficient’s decision to do business with the customer, potential customer, or business entity. This\nrestriction does not apply to an investment in a publicly-held company if the investment constitutes\n766012177.1 Page 4 of 13\nless than 5 percent of the ownership of that company.\nPersonal Use of Corporate Opportunities\nCorporate opportunities belong to Proficient. Covered Persons who become aware of an\nopportunity that would be appropriate for Proficient must pursue that opportunity on behalf of\nProficient, if it is interested, and not on behalf of themselves. Furthermore, Covered Persons may\nnot use Proficient’s property, information or position for personal gain, and must not compete\nwith Proficient.\nFair Dealing\nEach Covered Person must deal fairly with Proficient’s customers, suppliers, competitors,\nofficers and employees. Covered Persons should use their best judgment and avoid actions that\ncould be construed as taking unfair advantage or using unfair dealing practices. Examples include\nmanipulating people, concealing necessary information, abusing privileged information or\nmisrepresenting facts.\nFairness also requires that Covered Persons deal with competitors at arm’s length. For\nexample, agreements to restrain trade by setting prices with competitors violate antitrust laws\ndesigned to encourage competition.\nProtection and Use of Property\nAll Covered Persons should protect Proficient’s assets and ensure they are used for\nlegitimate business purposes during employment with Proficient. Improper use includes\nunauthorized personal appropriation or use of Proficient’s assets, data or resources, including\ncomputer equipment, software and data.\nStandards of Business Conduct\nProficient is committed to fostering a work environment in which all individuals are treated\nwith respect and dignity. Each individual should be permitted to work in a business-like\natmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities.\nThe following conduct will not be tolerated and could result in disciplinary action,\nincluding termination:\n Any act which causes doubt about a Covered Person’s integrity, such as the\nfalsifying of Proficient records and documents, competing in business with\nProficient, divulging trade secrets, or engaging in any criminal conduct.\n Any act which may create a dangerous situation, such as carrying weapons,\nfirearms or explosives on Proficient’s premises or surrounding areas, assaulting\nanother individual, or disregarding property and safety standards.\n The use, sale or purchase or attempted use, sale or purchase of alcohol or illegal\ndrugs while at work, or reporting to work in a condition not fit for work, such as\nreporting to work under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs.\n Insubordination, including refusal to perform a job assignment or to follow a\n766012177.1 Page 5 of 13\nreasonable request from a Covered Person’s manager or supervisor, or discourteous\nconduct toward customers, associates, supervisors or shareholders.\n Falsification or destruction of any timekeeping record, intentionally clocking in on\nanother Covered Person’s attendance or timekeeping record, assisting another\nCovered Person’s tampering with their attendance record or tampering with one’s\nown attendance record.\n Failure to perform work which meets the standards/expectations of the Covered\nPerson’s position.\n Excessive absenteeism, chronic tardiness, or consecutive absence without\nnotification or authorization.\n Any act of dishonesty or falsification of any of Proficient’s records or documents,\nincluding obtaining employment based on false, misleading, or omitted\ninformation.\nA Covered Person or Proficient may terminate the employment or service relationship at\nwill, at any time, without cause or advance notice, subject to the terms of any applicable\nemployment agreement. Thus, Proficient does not strictly adhere to a progressive disciplinary\nsystem since each incident of misconduct may have a different set of circumstances or differ in its\nseverity. Proficient will take such disciplinary action as it deems appropriate and commensurate\nwith any misconduct of the Covered Person.\nEmployment Practices\nProficient will not give any person any preferred conditions of employment because of\nfamilial or personal relationships. All personnel decisions are, and will be, based on sound\nmanagement practices and the individual merits of each applicant.\nProficient is firmly committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment\nand will not tolerate any discrimination or harassment of any kind. Examples include derogatory\ncomments based on race, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age, physical or mental\ndisability, religion or ethnicity, veteran status and unwelcome sexual advances.\nImproper Payments, Business Entertainment and Gifts\nCovered persons are prohibited from offering any payment, bribe, kickback, gift or other\nthing of value to or for the benefit of any customer, government official or other person for the\npurpose of improperly influencing a business decision or obtaining any improper advantage in\nconducting Proficient’s business or representing Proficient’s interests.\nCovered persons are also prohibited from soliciting, demanding or receiving any payment,\nbribe, kickback, gift or other thing of value for their personal benefit from any customer,\ngovernment official or other person as a condition of, or otherwise in connection with, doing\nbusiness with Proficient, including receiving favorable treatment from Proficient.\nThe giving and receiving of ordinary and reasonable business entertainment and gifts can\nbe a legitimate means of establishing and maintaining business relationships. Certain types of\nentertainment and gifts, however, may also create improper appearances and expectations or\nfeelings of commitment or obligation. In addition, providing gifts, entertainment, business\n766012177.1 Page 6 of 13\namenities or any other thing of value in any amount to government or public employees or officials\nmay be prohibited under applicable law.\nBefore accepting any business entertainment or gifts from any customer, supplier or other\nentity that does or seeks to do business with Proficient, you should carefully consider whether\naccepting the business entertainment or gift would give rise to a conflict of interest. Proficient\nemployees are required to exercise sound judgment and comply with this Code and all applicable\nlaws in all matters related to business entertainment and gifts. Consult with the Legal Department\nshould you have any questions in connection with these matters.\nProficient employees are not permitted to provide cash or other monetary gifts to, or accept\nthe same from, customers, government officials or other Proficient business relations. You may\nprovide to or accept from customers and other Proficient business relations (other than government\nofficials) permissible business entertainment, which includes meals, beverages, recreation,\nlodging, transportation and tickets to sporting or other events, in each case if they are associated\nwith a business purpose. You may also provide or receive reasonable gifts of nominal value to or\nfrom customers and other Proficient business relations (other than government officials). Although\nwhat constitutes a gift of nominal value will depend upon the circumstances, employees should\ngenerally consider no more than $100 per calendar year per customer, supplier or other entity to\nconstitute nominal value. You should consult with the Legal Department if you have questions\nabout the appropriateness of any particular gift or entertainment.\nBusiness entertainment, gifts and gratuities to government officials are highly regulated,\noften prohibited and may even subject an individual to criminal penalties. Before giving or offering\nany meal, gratuity, business entertainment or gifts to a government official, you are required to\nhave clearance from the Legal Department.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\nFCPA Governance\nProficient is firmly committed to administering the procedural controls necessary to\nprohibit employees from engaging in the activities contemplated by the Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct of 1977 (the “FCPA”). Following the guidelines set forth by the FCPA, Proficient strictly\nprohibits unauthorized facilitation payments (“Facilitation Payments”) to government officials\nof foreign countries (“Foreign Officials”).\nA Foreign Official shall include any officer or employee of a foreign government or any\ndepartment, agency, or instrumentality thereof, or of a public international organization, or any\nperson acting in an official capacity for or on the behalf of any such government or department,\nagency or instrumentality, or for or on the behalf of any public international organization.\nFacilitation Payments include the payment of any money or anything of value to a foreign\nofficial for the purposes of:\n(i) Influencing any act or decision of a foreign official in his or her official capacity\n(including, but not limited to, obtaining approval for government issued permits,\nlicenses or work visas);\n766012177.1 Page 7 of 13\n(ii) Inducing a foreign official to perform or abstain from performing any act in\nviolation of the foreign official’s lawful duty;\n(iii) Securing any improper business advantage; or\n(iv) Inducing a foreign official to use his or her official influence with a foreign\ngovernment (or instrumentality thereof) to affect or influence any act or decision of\nsuch government in order to assist the inducer in obtaining or retaining business\nwith the government, or directing such business to any person.\nCovered persons are prohibited from making payments to any person knowing that such\npayments will be used by the recipient as a Facilitation Payment to a Foreign Official.\nProficient acknowledges the importance of monitoring exchanges with Foreign Officials\nthat may not be considered a Facilitation Payment as set forth in the FCPA. In order to monitor\nsuch exchanges, Proficient requires that all employees obtain approval from Legal Department\nprior to the employee’s offer of any gift, gratuity, meal, charitable contribution, financial loan,\nagent/vendor due diligence, or any travel or entertainment expense to any of the following persons:\n1) A current or former Foreign Official, or close relative to such Foreign Official;\n2) An officer or employee of a foreign-owned bank, enterprise or wealth fund;\n3) A candidate for foreign office or an official of a foreign political party; or\n4) An officer or employee of a corporation in which a Foreign Official maintains a\ncontrolling ownership interest.\nInternal Controls and Review\nThe Legal Department will review the proposed expense or payment, the potential\nrecipient(s) of the offer, and the facts involved in the particular transaction. Upon review, the\nLegal Department will determine whether the proposed expense or payment would be considered\na violation of the FCPA or this section of this Code, and will provide the employee with a\ndetermination whether such expense or payment may be conducted.\nAll employee business expenses and payments are recorded within Proficient’s books and\nrecords and are subject to this Code and the employee’s departmental controls and periodic\nreviews. Proficient does not permit “off the book” business expenses or payments.\nProficient will conduct annual reviews of employee business expenses to determine\nwhether any payment may be considered a Facilitation Payment or otherwise prohibited by the\nFCPA or this Code.\nCovered Persons must use reasonable and proper judgment at all times and avoid any\nbusiness gift or business entertainment that might violate the FCPA or create the appearance of an\nattempt to improperly influence a Foreign Official. If a Covered Person believes a payment may\nhave been made in violation of the FCPA or this section of this Code, the employee is required to\nimmediately report the payment to the Legal Department. The Legal Department will investigate\nthe matter, determine whether such payment was made in violation of the FCPA or this section,\nand take appropriate action.\n766012177.1 Page 8 of 13\nContinued Training\nOn an annual basis, the Proficient Legal Department will provide FCPA training to educate\nall employees on types of prohibited payments, Foreign Officials and internal policies and\nprocedures for requesting a review of a proposed expense or payment. All employees will certify\non an annual basis that they have attended the training sessions and acknowledge their ongoing\ncompliance with this section.\nPolitical Contributions\nProficient does not make direct contributions to any candidates for federal, state or local\noffices where applicable laws make such contributions illegal and, in such cases, contributions to\npolitical campaigns must not be made with or reimbursed by Proficient’s funds or resources.\nProficient’s funds and resources include (but are not limited to) Proficient’s facilities, office\nsupplies, letterhead, telephones and fax machines. This Code does not prohibit Covered Persons\nfrom making personal political contributions as they see fit in accordance with all applicable laws,\nhowever employees must comply with Proficient’s pre-clearance requirements for political\ncontributions as applicable.\nOutside Business Activity\nA Covered Person may not engage in any outside business activities (including for one’s\nself) without first receiving the written approval of the Legal Department. Outside business\nactivities must also be promptly reported to the Human Resources Department and updated on an\nannual basis.\nDue to the fiduciary nature of Proficient’s business, all potential conflicts of interest that\ncould result from a Covered Person’s outside employment should be discussed with the Covered\nPerson’s supervisor or manager and the Human Resources Department, prior to seeking the written\napproval of the Legal Department.\nProficient recognizes that this “Outside Business Activity” section of this Code is not\napplicable to Directors who do not also serve in management positions within Proficient.\nDisclosures Made in Reports and Documents\nIt is important that Proficient’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”) and other federal, state, domestic and international regulatory agencies, and Proficient’s\nother public communications, are full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable. Proficient’s\npolicy is to comply with all applicable disclosure, financial reporting and accounting regulations\napplicable to Proficient. Proficient maintains the highest commitment to its disclosure and\n766012177.1 Page 9 of 13\nreporting requirements, and expects all Covered Persons to record information accurately and\ntruthfully in the books and records of Proficient.\nDepending on his or her position with Proficient, a Covered Person may be called upon to\nprovide necessary information to ensure that Proficient’s public reports and regulatory filings, and\nother public communications, are full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable.

Covered Persons may not establish undisclosed or unrecorded\nfunds on behalf of Proficient for any purpose. Proficient does not permit any attempts to create\nfalse or misleading records, and Covered Persons may not record or establish any false or\nmisleading entries in Proficient’s books and records for any reason.\nProficient’s business transactions must be properly authorized and completely and\naccurately recorded on Proficient’s books in accordance with Proficient’s established financial,\naccounting and management policies. No payment or transfer of Proficient’s funds or assets may\nbe made or approved with the intention or understanding that any part of such payment or transfer\nis to be used other than as specified in the supporting documents.\nCovered Persons should always retain or destroy records according to Proficient’s record\nretention guidelines. In no event should records be destroyed that relate to an existing dispute or\ninvestigation, unless directed by Proficient’s Legal Department. Covered Persons should consult\nProficient’s chief legal officer or his/her designee with any questions concerning record retention.\nAccountability for Adherence to this Code\nNew Covered Persons will receive a copy of this Code during the orientation process\nconducted by representatives of the Human Resources Department or the Legal Department and\nshall acknowledge that they have received, read and understand this Code and will comply with\nthe requirements of this Code.

Nothing in this Code restricts Proficient from\ntaking any disciplinary action on any matters pertaining to the conduct of a Covered Person,\nwhether or not expressly set forth in this Code.\nReporting Violations of this Code\nDescribed in this Code are procedures generally available for addressing ethical issues that\nmay arise. As a general matter, if a Covered Person has any questions or concerns about\ncompliance with this Code, he or she is encouraged to speak with his or her supervisor, manager,\nand representatives of the Human Resources Department or the Legal Department (including\nProficient’s chief legal officer).\nIf a Covered Person does not feel comfortable talking to any of the persons listed above for\nany reason, he or she should call, fax or email Proficient’s ethics hotline as communicated to\nemployees from time to time.

To encourage Covered Persons to report violations of illegal or\nunethical conduct, Proficient will not allow retaliation to be taken against any Covered Person who\nhas made a report of such conduct in good faith.\n766012177.1 Page 11 of 13\nThe law requires that Proficient’s Audit Committee have in place procedures for the\nreceipt, retention and treatment of complaints concerning accounting, internal accounting controls,\nand auditing matters and procedures for Covered Persons to submit their concerns regarding\nquestionable accounting or auditing matters (please refer to the Proficient Whistleblower Policy\nfor more information).
