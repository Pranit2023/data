The notice confirmed that the Company has regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement as set forth in Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Rule”).\n\nPreviously on October 23, 2023, Nasdaq notified the Company that its Common Stock failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 over the previous 30 consecutive business days as required by the Bid Price Rule. Nasdaq determined that for the last 10 consecutive business days, from October 2, 2024, to October 15, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock was at $1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, the Company has regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and this matter is now closed.\n\nAndy Ross, CEO of American Rebel, stated, “We are pleased to report that Nasdaq has recognized our compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. With the resolution of this compliance issue, we can continue to build upon the great progress made during 2024 by concentrating our resources on continuing to improve and advance our Champion Safe and American Rebel Beverage business units. The recent launch of our domestic premium light lager beer, American Rebel Light, has continued to exceed expectations. Since our first production run at the end of August 2024 we have announced several shipments to our distribution partners and can proudly state that American Rebel Light Beer – America’s Patriotic, God-Fearing, Constitution-Loving, National Anthem-Singing, Stand Your Ground Beer, is now available at retail establishments within our distributor service territories and being served at several on-premise accounts. Champion Safe has continued to streamline its operations and product offerings, which has reduced the overall monthly burn and is prepared for scale around the new rightsized product mix, including the introduction of new products to satisfy market demand in Q4 and Q1 of next year. Our focus remains on capturing market share and revenue growth in order to increase stockholder value.”\n\n**About American Rebel Holdings, Inc.**\n\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.**\n\nPurchase and Exchange Agreement\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company entered into a Purchase and Exchange Agreement among an investor (the \"Purchaser”) and Altbanq Lending LLC (the \"Seller”), pursuant to which the Purchaser agreed to purchase from the Seller a portion ($150,469.11) of a promissory note dated March 27, 2024 in the original principal amount of $1,330,000 (the \"Note”), with a current balance payable of $1,229,350 (the \"Note Balance”).\n\nContemporaneously with assignment of the assigned note portion to the Purchaser, the Company exchanged the $150,469.11 of assigned note portion for 78,615 shares of the Company’s common stock as a 3(a)(9) exchange.\n\nAt any time during the ninety days after the initial closing, the Purchaser may purchase additional portions of the Note, at one or more closing, by sending an additional closing notice in the amount set forth in the additional note notice and the Company will exchange such additional portions for shares of its common stock as a 3(a)(9) exchange. The additional shares will be calculated by dividing the relevant additional portion by 75% of the average of the three lowest bids for the Company’s common stock on its principal trading market on the five trading days prior to the closing of the purchase of the additional portion.\n\nThe Purchase and Exchange Agreement contains a beneficial ownership limitation of 4.99% of the number of the common shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of common shares issuable upon any closing of the purchase of an additional portion by the Purchaser. No closing of the purchase of any additional portion shall take effect nor shall the Purchaser be able to purchase any additional portion to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after closing, the Purchaser (together with the Purchaser’s Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser’s Affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of the beneficial ownership limitation.\n\nThe Company will not issue shares of common stock in excess of 19.99% of the shares outstanding as of the date of the Purchase and Exchange Agreement. In the event the previous sentence restricts the Company’s ability to completely convert the Note, the Company will seek stockholder approval to allow the issuance shares of common stock in excess of 19.99% of the shares outstanding.\n\nFor a period of ninety days after the closing, the Seller and Company shall not further amend the Note nor allow any payments to be made on account of the Note. In the event there has been a material adverse event with the Company or tother reasonable cause, upon fifteen (15) days written notice, the Seller may accelerate the termination of this period.\n\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Purchase and Exchange Agreement and of all of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Purchase and Exchange Agreement are qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase and Exchange Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nOID Note\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company entered into a twelve-month promissory note with an accredited investor (the \"Lender”) in the principal amount of $400,000 (the \"Note”). An original issue discount of $80,000 was applied on the issuance date and was paid through the issuance of 26,756 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Lender, resulting in net loan proceeds to the Company of $320,000. Accrued, unpaid interest and outstanding principal, subject to adjustment, is required to be paid in seven payments of $52,571.43, with the first payment due on May 11, 2025, and remaining six payments due on the 11th day of each month thereafter (a total payback to the Lender of $368,000.01).\n\nUpon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, the Note shall become immediately due and payable and the Company will be obligated to pay to the Lender, in full satisfaction of its obligations, an amount equal to 130% times the sum of (w) the then outstanding principal amount of the Note plus (x) accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Note to the date of payment plus (y) any amounts owed to the Lender pursuant to the conversion rights referenced below.\n\n2  \n---  \n  \nAt any time after 180 days from the issuance date of the Note, the Lender may convert the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the Note into restricted shares of common stock of the Company at the lesser of (i) $2.94 per share, or (ii) the average of the three (3) lowest VWAP’s in the preceding five (5) day trading period to the conversion date. The Lender agreed to limit the amount of stock received to less than 4.99% of the total outstanding common stock. There are no warrants or other derivatives attached to this Note. The Company agreed to reserve a number of shares of common stock equal to three times the number of shares of common stock which may be issuable upon conversion of the Note at all times.\n\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Note and of all of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Note is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.**\n\nThe information set forth above in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**Item 3.02 Sale of Unregistered Securities.**\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company authorized the issuance of 78,615 shares of common stock pursuant to the Purchase and Exchange Agreement described in Item 1.01 above.\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company authorized the issuance of 26,756 shares of common stock pursuant to the OID Note described in Item 1.01 above.\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company authorized the issuance of 44,000 shares of common stock to Charles A. Ross, Jr., the Company’s CEO and Chairman, upon the conversion of 88 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\n\nThe issuance of the shares of Common Stock will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of that Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) thereof. The recipients are accredited investors with the experience and expertise to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in securities of the Company and the financial means to bear the risks of such an investment.\n\n**Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.**\n\nOn November 12, 2024, the Company issued a press release entitled \"American Rebel Light Debuts at Renowned Nashville Bar and Original Live Music Venue The Local Nashville and The Local Hendersonville.” A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.\n\nThe press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

As of the date hereof $1,229,350 in principal (**“Note Balance”**) (constituting $910,000 of the original principal, $150 bounce payment fee, $15,000 late fee and $304,200 collection costs) is due and payable under the Note.\n\nWHEREAS, the Seller desires to sell a portion of the Note consisting of $150,469.11 (the “**Assigned Note Portion** ”) to the Purchaser and the Purchaser desires to purchase the Assigned Note Portion from the Seller on the terms set forth in this Agreement;\n\nWHEREAS, the Company agrees that contemporaneously with assignment of the Assigned Note Portion to the Purchaser the Company will exchange the Assigned Note Portion for 78,615 shares of the Company’s common stock (at $1.914 per share) as a 3(a)(9) exchange (the “**Exchange Shares** ”);\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:\n\n**ARTICLE I**\n\n**PURCHASE AND SALE**\n\n1.1 _The Initial Closing_.

Any security interest arising from or securing the Note shall not be terminated at the Closing. All of the Seller’s rights under the Note and documents delivered in connection with the underlying loan shall remain in full force and effect except that the Assigned Note Portion shall be deemed satisfied.

The Additional Shares will be calculated by dividing the relevant Additional Portion by 75% of the average of the three lowest bids for the Company’s common stock on its principal trading market on the five trading days prior to the closing of the purchase of the Additional Portion. Each Additional Closing Notice shall set forth the Additional Portion being purchased, which shall also be the Purchase Price and the number of Additional Shares to be issued. At the closing of each Additional Portion the parties shall make the same deliveries as set forth in Section 1.2 (b) and 1.2(c).\n\nThe “Beneficial Ownership Limitation” shall be 4.99% of the number of the Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of common shares issuable upon any closing of the purchase of an Additional Portion by the Purchaser.

For a period of ninety days after the Closing (the “**Standstill Period** ”), the Seller and Company shall not further amend the Note nor allow any payments to be made on account of the Note. In the event there has been a material adverse event with the Company or tother reasonable cause, upon fifteen (15) days written notice, the Seller may accelerate the termination of the Standstill Period.\n\n1.6 _Enforcement_.

In the event the Company fails to issue to the Purchaser any Exchange Shares or Additional Shares within one trading day after the relevant Closing, the Purchaser shall have the right to rescind such purchase. Upon such rescission, the Company will not be required to issue any shares of common stock, the amount owed on the Note will remain as it was had such purchase not occurred and the Seller will return the relevant purchase price.\n\n1.10 _Funds received_. Notwithstanding Section 1.5 to the extent any payments are received during the Standstill Period the Seller may apply such Payment to the outstanding amounts owed on the Note or return such funds to the Company.

The Purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares is being acquired from the Seller without the Company furnishing any information to the Purchaser and that the Purchaser has not had any communication with the Company or any officer, director, or representative thereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as contained herein.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \n(E) If Purchaser has chosen to do so, Purchaser has been represented by such legal and tax counsel and other professionals, each of whom has been personally selected by Purchaser, as Purchaser has found necessary to consult concerning the purchase of the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares.\n\n(F) With respect to the United States federal, state and foreign tax aspects of Purchaser’s investment, Purchaser is relying solely upon the advice of Purchaser’s own tax advisors, and/or upon Purchaser’s own knowledge with respect thereto.\n\n(G) Purchaser has not relied, and will not rely upon, any information with respect to this Agreement other than the information contained in this Agreement. Purchaser understands that no person has been authorized to make representations or to give any information or literature with respect to this Agreement that is inconsistent with the information that is set forth in this Agreement.\n\n(H) Purchaser understands that, other than as provided in this Agreement, no covenants, representations, or warranties have been authorized by or will be binding upon the Company, with regard to this Agreement, the performance of the Company or any expectation of investment returns, including any representations, warranties or agreements contained or made in any written document or oral communication received from or had with the Company, its Affiliates, Company counsel or any of their respective representatives or agents. Purchaser has not relied upon any information or representation that may be or has been made or given except as permitted under this Agreement.\n\n(I) Purchaser understands that the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares has not been registered under the Act, or pursuant to the provisions of the securities or other laws of any other applicable jurisdictions. The Purchaser is aware that the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares are “restricted securities” as such term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Act (“Rule 144”), and they may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144 unless all of the conditions of Rule 144 are met.\n\n(J) Purchaser has substantial investment experience and is familiar with investments of the type contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser is aware that purchase of the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares is a speculative investment involving a high degree of risk and there is no guarantee that Purchaser will realize any gain from Purchaser’s investment or realize any tax benefits therefrom and Purchaser is further aware that Purchaser may lose all or a substantial part of Purchaser’s investment. Purchaser understands that there are substantial restrictions on the transferability of the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares. Purchaser affirms that Purchaser acknowledges that this investment is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk and, accordingly, Purchaser can afford to lose its entire investment.\n\n(K) The Purchaser hereby agrees that the Company may insert the following or similar legend on the face of the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares and any shares of the Company’s common stock issued upon exchange of the Note, if required in compliance with the Securities Act or state securities laws:\n\n“These securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“ _Act_ ”), or any state securities laws and may not be sold or otherwise transferred or disposed of except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act and any applicable state securities laws, or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to counsel to the Company that an exemption from registration under the act and any applicable state securities laws is available.”  \n---  \n  \n5  \n---  \n  \n2.3 _Consent, Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The Company hereby makes the following representations and warranties:\n\n(A) _Consent_.

Interest payable on this Note shall accrue on the Issuance Date and shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and actual days elapsed at a rate per annum (the “**Interest Rate** ”) equal to 15% per annum. Interest on the Principal Amount shall be payable in full on the Maturity Date, whether by acceleration or otherwise.\n\n2. _Monthly Payments_. Accrued, unpaid Interest and outstanding principal, subject to adjustment, shall be paid in seven (7) payments each in the amount of $52,571.43 (a total payback to the Holder of $368,000.01). The first payment shall be due May 11, 2025 with six (6) subsequent payments on the 11th day of each month thereafter. The Company shall have a thirty (30) day grace period with respect to each payment. The Company shall not have the right to accelerate payments or prepay this Note at any time. All payments shall be made by bank wire transfer to the Holder’s wire instructions, attached hereto as Exhibit A. For the avoidance of doubt, a missed payment shall be considered an Event of Default, subject to the cure period set forth above. Holder, at its sole option, may defer any monthly payment due hereunder pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Deferral Notice and Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit B.\n\n3. _Borrower Redemption of Principal Amount_. Upon mutual agreement between the Borrower and Holder, the Borrower may have the option of prepaying the outstanding Principal Amount, in whole or in part, by paying to the Holder a sum of money equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Principal Amount to be redeemed, together with accrued but unpaid Interest thereon and any and all other sums due, accrued or payable to the Holder arising under this Note.\n\n1  \n---  \n  \n4. _Issuance of Replacement Note_. Upon any partial repayment, deferral or conversion of this Note, a replacement Note containing the same date and provisions of this Note shall, at the written request of the Holder, be issued by the Borrower to the Holder for the outstanding Principal Amount of this Note and accrued Interest which shall not have been paid.\n\n5. _Conversion Right_. At any time after 180 days from the Issuance Date of this Note, the Holder shall have the right to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid amount of this Note into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issuance Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price determined as provided herein (a “**Conversion** ”); provided, however, that in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “**Exchange Act** ”), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso. The beneficial ownership The beneficial ownership limitations on conversion as set forth in the section may NOT be waived by the Holder. The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the “**Notice of Conversion** ”), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section 5(c) below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the “**Conversion Date** ”); however, if the Notice of Conversion is sent after 6:00pm, New York, New York time the Conversion Date shall be the next business day. The term “**Conversion Amount** ” means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount plus accrued interest of this Note to be converted in such conversion plus (2) at the Holder’s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or (2) plus (4) at the Holder’s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Section 5(c) hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and in addition to the limitations set forth herein, if the Borrower has not obtained Stockholder Approval, the Borrower shall not issue a number of shares of Common Stock under this Agreement, which when aggregated with all other securities that are required to be aggregated for purposes of Rule 5635(d), would exceed 19.99% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of definitive agreement with respect to the first of such aggregated transactions (the “**Conversion Limitation** ”). For purposes of this section, “**Stockholder Approval** ” means such approval as may be required by the applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (or any successor entity) from the stockholders of the Company with respect to the issuance of the shares under this Agreement that, when taken together with any other securities that are required to be aggregated with the issuance of the shares issued under this Agreement for purposes of Rule 5635(d) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“**Rule 5635(d)** ”), would exceed 19.99% of the issued and outstanding common stock as of the date of definitive agreement with respect to the first of such aggregated transactions. “**Principal Market** ” means the Exchanges, the quotation platforms maintained by the OTC Markets Group or an equivalent replacement exchange, and all rules and regulations relating to such exchange. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Limitation shall no longer apply to limit the issuance of shares in conversion of this Note.\n\n2  \n---  \n  \n(a) _Conversion Price_. Subject to Nasdaq Rules limiting the conversion price to 75% of the Market Price, the Conversion Price shall mean the lesser of (i) $2.94 per share (the closing price of Borrower’s common stock on the day prior to the Issuance Date), or (ii) the Market Price (as defined herein) (subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower’s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events). If the Conversion Price is subject to adjustment based upon Nasdaq Rules, the Conversion Price shall be the set at the lowest price applicable for the conversion to comply with Nasdaq Rules. “**Market Price** ” means the average of the three (3) lowest VWAP’s in the preceding five (5) day trading period to the Conversion Date. “**VWAP** ” means, for any security as of any date, the dollar volume-weighted average price for such security on the Principal Market (or, if the Principal Market is not the principal trading market for such security, then on the principal securities exchange or securities market on which such security is then traded), during the period beginning at 9:30 a.m., New York time, and ending at 4:00 p.m., New York time, as reported by Bloomberg through its “VAP” function (set to 09:30 start time and 16:00 end time) or, if the foregoing does not apply, the dollar volume-weighted average price of such security in the over-the-counter market on the electronic bulletin board for such security during the period beginning at 9:30 a.m., New York time, and ending at 4:00 p.m., New York time, as reported by Bloomberg, or, if no dollar volume-weighted average price is reported for such security by Bloomberg for such hours, the average of the highest closing bid price and the lowest closing ask price of any of the market makers for such security as reported in The Pink Open Market (or a similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices). If the VWAP cannot be calculated for such security on such date on any of the foregoing bases, the VWAP of such security on such date shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the Holder. All such determinations shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction during such period.\n\n(b) _Authorized Shares_. The Borrower covenants that during the period that the Note is outstanding, the Borrower will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive rights, to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note. The Borrower is required at all times to have authorized and reserved three times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note (based on the Conversion Price of the Note in effect from time to time initially 321,071 shares) (the “**Reserved Amount** ”). The Reserved Amount shall be increased (or decreased) from time to time (and in the case of each payment received by the Holder hereunder) in accordance with the Borrower’s obligations hereunder. The Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In addition, if the Borrower shall issue any securities or make any change to its capital structure which would change the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes shall be convertible at the then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at the same time make proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of the outstanding Note. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note.\n\n3  \n---  \n  \n(c) _Method of Conversion_.\n\n(i) __Mechanics of Conversion__. As set forth in Section 5 hereof, at any time following 180 days from the Issuance Date, the balance due pursuant to this Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject to Section 4.5(c)(ii), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower (upon payment in full of any amounts owed hereunder).\n\n(ii) __Surrender of Note Upon Conversion__. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion.\n\n(iii) __Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion__. Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 5(c), the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days after such receipt subject to the terms hereof and applicable rules of the Principal Market (as defined hereinbelow) (the “**Deadline** ”) (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof. Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations hereunder, all rights with respect to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Borrower’s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \n(iv) __Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer__. In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company (“**DTC** ”) Fast Automated Securities Transfer (“**FAST** ”) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions set forth herein, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder’s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit and Withdrawal at Custodian (“**DWAC** ”) system.\n\n(v) __Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline__. Without in any way limiting the Holder’s right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline due to willful and purposeful action and/or inaction of the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $500 per day in cash, for each day beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock (the “**Fail to Deliver Fee** ”); provided; however that the Fail to Deliver Fee shall not be due if the failure is a result of a third party (i.e., transfer agent; and not the result of any failure to pay such transfer agent) despite the best efforts of the Borrower to effect delivery of such Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 5(c)(v) are justified.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \n(d) _Concerning the Shares_. The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless: (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration (such as Rule 144 or a successor rule) (“**Rule 144** ”); or (iii) such shares are transferred to an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 5(d) and who is an “accredited investor” as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D.\n\nAny restrictive legend on certificates representing shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel from Holder’s counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that (i) a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the Act, which opinion shall be accepted by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected; or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration statement filed under the Act; or otherwise may be sold pursuant to an exemption from registration.\n\n(e) _Effect of Certain Events_.\n\n(i) __Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc__. At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation, merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower is not the survivor shall be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Section 6) pursuant to which the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined in Section 6). “**Person** ” shall mean any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \n(ii) __Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc__. If, at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Note, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization, or other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction described in this Section 5(e)(ii) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, ten (10) days prior written notice (but in any event at least five (5) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of stockholders to approve, or if there is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Note. The above provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges.\n\n(iii) __Adjustment Due to Distribution__.

If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury, the applicable provision shall automatically be revised to equal the maximum rate of interest or other amount deemed interest permitted under applicable law. The Borrower covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not seek to claim or take advantage of any law that would prohibit or forgive the Borrower from paying all or a portion of the principal or interest on this Note.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**IN WITNESS WHEREOF** , the Borrower has caused this Note to be signed in its name effective as of this 11th day of November, 2024.\n\n**AMERICAN REBEL HOLDINGS, INC.**  \n---  \nBy: | /s/ Charles A.

(NASDAQ: AREB) (“American Rebel” or the “Company”), creator of American Rebel Light Beer ( _americanrebelbeer.com_ ), and a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of branded safes, personal security and self-defense products and apparel, is proud to announce the debut of its American Rebel Light Lager at The Local Nashville ( _localnash.com_ ) and The Local Hendersonville.\n\n“I couldn’t think of a better time than Veterans Day to bring in the truly patriotic beer that American Rebel is **,”** said Geoff Reid, owner of The Local. “It embodies everything I believe in as an American and as a business owner – the perfect match.”\n\n“I’m really excited to have American Rebel Light available at The Local,” said Andy Ross, CEO of American Rebel Holdings. “The Local is a strong supporter of original live music and is a great venue for songwriters, artist showcases, good food and now American Rebel Light! Geoff saw a need for an accessible live music room and he built it much like we saw a need for a patriotic American beer and we created it.”\n\nAs a songwriter himself, Geoff Reid has first-hand experience playing local shows around Nashville. After performing at a popular Nashville singer-songwriter venue with a limited amount of tickets to share with his friends and family, Geoff realized Nashville needed a performance space where up-and-coming as well as the top hit songwriters could not only play and audition their new original songs for top country music artists, but also hang out with friends and family in more of a relaxed atmosphere. In 2017, driven by his passion for music and love of community, Geoff opened the doors of The Local Nashville for performers and their supporters who craved a true “local” experience.\n\nAmerican Rebel Beer’s Tennessee distributor, _Best Brands, Inc_ ., arranged for American Rebel Light to be featured at The Local Nashville and The Local Hendersonville. “Great bars, live music, great people and a great community,” said Andy Ross. “A perfect home for America’s Patriotic, God-Fearing, Constitution-Loving, National Anthem-Singing, Stand Your Ground Beer.”\n\nThe Local Nashville is located at 110 28 th Avenue North near Centennial Park and Vanderbilt University just off West End Avenue in Nashville. The Local Hendersonville is located at 300 Indian Lake Blvd, Building B100, in The Street of Indian Lake development in Hendersonville, TN, just north of Nashville.\n\nAmerican Rebel Light Beer is produced in partnership with AlcSource, the largest integrated provider of beverage development, sourcing, and production solutions in the U.S. American Rebel Light Beer is a Premium Domestic Light Lager.\n\nFor an updated list of locations featuring American Rebel Light, visit americanrebelbeer.com.\n\n1  \n---  \n  \n**About American Rebel Holdings, Inc.**\n\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.

All Principal and Interest owing hereunder, along with any and all other amounts, shall be due and owing on December 31, 2024 (the “Maturity Date”). Interest shall accrue on a monthly basis and is payable on the Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the final payment of Principal and Interest shall be due on the Maturity Date. This Note may be prepaid in whole or in part as set forth herein. Any amount of Principal or Interest on this Note which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of the lesser of (i) twenty-two percent (22%) per annum and (ii) the maximum amount permitted under law from the due date thereof until the same is paid (the “Default Interest”). Default Interest shall commence accruing upon an Event of Default and shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. All payments due hereunder (to the extent not converted into common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”) in accordance with the terms hereof) shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America. All payments shall be made at such address as the Holder shall hereafter give to the Borrower by written notice made in accordance with the provisions of this Note. Whenever any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is not a business day, the same shall instead be due on the next succeeding day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest payment date which is not the date on which this Note is paid in full, the extension of the due date thereof shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount of interest due on such date. As used in this Note, the term “business day” shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which commercial banks in the city of New York, New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed. Each capitalized term used herein, and not otherwise defined, shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated the date hereof, pursuant to which this Note was originally issued (the “Purchase Agreement”).\n\nThis Note carries an original issue discount of $70,000 (the “OID”), to cover the Holder’s monitoring costs associated with the purchase and sale of the Note, which is included in the principal balance of this Note. Thus, the purchase price of this Note shall be $350,000 computed as follows: the Principal Amount minus the OID.\n\nThis Note is free from all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive rights or other similar rights of stockholders of the Borrower and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof.\n\nThe following terms shall also apply to this Note:\n\nArticle I. CONVERSION RIGHTS UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT\n\n1.1 _Conversion Right_. The Holder shall have the right, from time to time **following an Event of Default** , and ending on the date of payment of the Default Amount (as defined in Article III) pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Article III, each in respect of the remaining outstanding principal amount of this Note to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal, interest, penalties, and all other amounts under this Note into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the Conversion Price (as defined below) determined as provided herein (a “Conversion”); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso. The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Notice of Conversion”), delivered to the Borrower or Borrower’s transfer agent by the Holder in accordance with Section 1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower or Borrower’s transfer agent before 11:59 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the “Conversion Date”). The term “Conversion Amount” means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion _plus_ (2) at the Holder’s option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date, provided however, that the Borrower shall have the right to pay any or all interest in cash _plus_ (3) at the Holder’s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or (2) _plus_ (4) at the Holder’s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g) hereof.\n\n2  \n---  \n  \n1.2 _Conversion Price_.\n\n(a) _Calculation of Conversion Price_. Subject to the adjustments described herein, the conversion price (the “Conversion Price”) shall equal eighty percent (80%) of the lowest traded price of the Common Stock during the twenty (20) Business Days prior to a Notice of Conversion. To the extent the Conversion Price of the Borrower’s Common Stock closes below the par value per share, the Borrower will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The Borrower agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this adjustment. If the shares of the Borrower’s Common Stock have not been delivered within one (1) business day to the Borrower or Borrower’s transfer agent, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. At any time after the Closing Date, if in the case that the Borrower’s Common Stock is not deliverable by DWAC (including if the Borrower’s transfer agent has a policy prohibiting or limiting delivery of shares of the Borrower’s Common Stock specified in a Notice of Conversion), an additional 10% discount will apply for all future conversions under all Notes until DWAC delivery becomes available. If in the case that the Borrower’s Common Stock is “chilled” for deposit into the DTC system and only eligible for clearing deposit, a 15% discount shall apply for all future conversions under this Note until such chill is lifted. Additionally, if the Borrower ceases to be a reporting company pursuant to the 1934 Act or if the Note cannot be converted into free trading shares after one hundred eighty-one (181) days from the Issue Date (other than as a result of the Holder’s status as an affiliate of the Company), an additional 15% discount will be attributed to the Conversion Price. If the trading price cannot be calculated for such security on such date in the manner provided above, the trading price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the Holder. “Trading Day” shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period on the OTC Pink, OTCQB or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded. The Borrower shall be responsible for the fees of its transfer agent and all DTC fees associated with any such issuance. Holder shall be entitled to deduct $500.00 from the conversion amount in each Notice of Conversion to cover Holder’s deposit fees associated with each Notice of Conversion.\n\n.\n\n3  \n---  \n  \n(b) _Conversion Price During Major Announcements_. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 1.2(a) to the contrary, in the event the Borrower (i) makes a public announcement that it intends to consolidate or merge with any other corporation (other than a merger in which the Borrower is the surviving or continuing corporation and its capital stock is unchanged) or sell or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or (ii) any person, group or entity (including the Borrower) publicly announces a tender offer to purchase 50% or more of the Borrower’s Common Stock (or any other takeover scheme) (the date of the announcement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) is hereinafter referred to as the “Announcement Date”), then the Conversion Price shall, effective upon the Announcement Date and continuing through the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date (as defined below), be equal to the lower of (x) the Conversion Price which would have been applicable for a Conversion occurring on the Announcement Date and (y) the Conversion Price that would otherwise be in effect. From and after the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date, the Conversion Price shall be determined as set forth in this Section 1.2(a). For purposes hereof, “Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date” shall mean, with respect to any proposed transaction or tender offer (or takeover scheme) for which a public announcement as contemplated by this Section 1.2(b) has been made, the date upon which the Borrower (in the case of clause (i) above) or the person, group or entity (in the case of clause (ii) above) consummates or publicly announces the termination or abandonment of the proposed transaction or tender offer (or takeover scheme) which caused this Section 1.2(b) to become operative.\n\n(c) _Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes_. In the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder in connection with a conversion of this Note, the Borrower shall issue to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 4.13.\n\n(d) If at any time the Conversion Price as determined hereunder for any conversion would be less than the par value of the Common Stock, then the Conversion Price hereunder shall equal such par value for such conversion and the Conversion Amount for such conversion shall be increased to include Additional Principal, where “Additional Principal” means such additional amount to be added to the Conversion Amount to the extent necessary to cause the number of conversion shares issuable upon such conversion to equal the same number of conversion shares as would have been issued had the Conversion Price not been subject to the minimum price set forth in this Section 1.2(c).\n\n1.3 _Authorized Shares_. The Borrower covenants that during the period while any outstanding balance is owing hereunder or any conversion of the Note is available, the Borrower will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive rights, to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Borrower is required at all times to have authorized and reserved at least four (4) times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note (based on the Conversion Price of this Note in effect from time to time) (the “Reserved Amount”). The Reserved Amount shall be increased from time to time in accordance with the Borrower’s obligations pursuant to Section 3(d) of the Purchase Agreement. The Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In addition, if the Borrower shall issue any securities or make any change to its capital structure which would change the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Note shall be convertible at the then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at the same time make proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of this Note. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Reserved Amount be lower than the initial Reserved Amount, regardless of any prior conversions.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \nIf, at any time the Borrower does not maintain or replenish the Reserved Amount as required hereunder within three (3) business days of the request of the Holder, the principal amount of the Note shall increase by One Thousand and No/100 United States Dollars ($1,000) (under Holder’s and Borrower’s expectation that any principal amount increase will tack back to the Issue Date) per occurrence.\n\n1.4 _Method of Conversion_.\n\n(a) _Mechanics of Conversion_. Subject to Section 1.1, this Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after an Event of Default, by (A) submitting to the Borrower or Borrower’s transfer agent a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 11:59 p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower.\n\n(b) _Surrender of Note Upon Conversion_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Borrower shall, _prima facie,_ be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as aforesaid, the Holder may not transfer this Note unless the Holder first physically surrenders this Note to the Borrower, whereupon the Borrower will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Holder (upon payment by the Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note represented by this Note may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.\n\n(c) _Payment of Taxes_. The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion of this Note in a name other than that of the Holder (or in street name), and the Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver any such shares or other securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian in whose street name such shares are to be held for the Holder’s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Borrower the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been paid.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \n(d) _Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion_. Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within one (1) business day after such receipt (the “Deadline”) (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement.\n\n(e) _Obligation of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock_. Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Borrower’s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received by the Borrower before 11:59 p.m., New York, New York time, on such date.\n\n(f) _Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer_. In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) Fast Automated Securities Transfer (“FAST”) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions contained in Section 1.1 and in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder’s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal At Custodian (“DWAC”) system.\n\n(g) _DTC Eligibility & Market Loss_. If the Borrower intentionally fails to maintain its status as “DTC Eligible”, the principal amount of the Note shall increase by Fifty Thousand and No/100 United States Dollars ($50,000) (under Holder’s and Borrower’s expectation that any principal amount increase will tack back to the Issue Date) and the Variable Conversion Price shall be redefined to mean fifty percent (50%) multiplied by the lowest closing bid price during the fifty (50) Business Days prior to a Notice of Conversion, subject to adjustment as provided in this Note.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \n(h) _Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Delivery Deadline_. Without in any way limiting the Holder’s right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline (other than a failure due to the circumstances described in Section 1.3 above, which failure shall be governed by such Section) the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $1,000 per day in cash, for each day beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock until the Borrower issues and delivers a certificate to the Holder or credit the Holder’s balance account with OTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon such Holder’s conversion of any Conversion Amount (under Holder’s and Borrower’s expectation that any damages will tack back to the Issue Date). Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 1.4(h) are justified.\n\n(i) _Rescindment of a Notice of Conversion_. If (i) the Borrower fails to respond to Holder within one (1) business day from the Conversion Date confirming the details of Notice of Conversion, (ii) the Borrower fails to provide any of the shares of the Borrower’s Common Stock requested in the Notice of Conversion within three (3) business days from the date of receipt of the Note of Conversion, (iii) the Holder is unable to procure a legal opinion required to have the shares of the Borrower’s Common Stock issued unrestricted and/or deposited to sell for any reason related to the Borrower’s standing, (iv) the Holder is unable to deposit the shares of the Borrower’s Common Stock requested in the Notice of Conversion for any reason related to the Borrower’s standing, (v) at any time after a missed Deadline, at the Holder’s sole discretion, or (vi) if OTC Markets changes the Borrower’s designation to ‘Limited Information’ (Yield), ‘No Information’ (Stop Sign), ‘Caveat Emptor’ (Skull & Crossbones), ‘OTC’, ‘Other OTC’ or ‘Grey Market’ (Exclamation Mark Sign) or other trading restriction on the day of or any day after the Conversion Date, the Holder maintains the option and sole discretion to rescind the Notice of Conversion (“Rescindment”) with a “Notice of Rescindment.”\n\n7  \n---  \n  \n1.5 _Concerning the Shares_. The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act (or a successor rule) (“Rule 144”) or other applicable exemption or (iv) such shares are transferred to an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Holder who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 1.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase Agreement (and subject to the removal provisions set forth below), until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note have been registered under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 or other applicable exemption without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note that has not been so included in an effective registration statement or that has not been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the legend, shall bear a legend substantially in the following form, as appropriate:\n\n**“NEITHER THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT OR OTHER APPLICABLE EXEMPTION. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.”**\n\nThe legend set forth above shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if (i) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the Act, which opinion shall be reasonably accepted by the Borrower so that the sale or transfer is effected or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 or other applicable exemption without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. Unless advised by counsel to the Borrower that the opinion of counsel does not comply with federal or state securities laws, in the event that the Borrower does not accept the opinion of counsel provided by the Holder with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration, such as Rule 144 or Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note.\n\n1.6 _Effect of Certain Events_.\n\n(a) _Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc_. At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation, merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower is not the survivor shall either: (i) be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined in Article III) or (ii) be treated pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof. “Person” shall mean any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n(b) _Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc_. If, at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Notes, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization, or other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction described in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, fifteen (15) days prior written notice (but in any event at least ten (10) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders to approve, or if there is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Section 1.6(b). The above provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges.\n\n(c) _Adjustment Due to Distribution_. If the Borrower shall declare or make any distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including any dividend or distribution to the Borrower’s shareholders in cash or shares (or rights to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off)) (a “Distribution”), then the Holder of this Note shall be entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record for determining shareholders entitled to such Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable to the Holder with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to such Distribution.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n(d) _Purchase Rights_. If, at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues any convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (the “Purchase Rights”) pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock, then the Holder of this Note will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.\n\n(e) _Notice of Adjustments_. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price as a result of the events described in this Section 1.6, the Borrower, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment and prepare and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Borrower shall, upon the written request at any time of the Holder, furnish to such Holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities or property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Note.\n\n1.7 _Status as Stockholder_. Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion by a Holder, (i) the shares covered thereby (other than the shares, if any, which cannot be issued because their issuance would exceed such Holder’s allocated portion of the Reserved Amount or Maximum Share Amount) shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii) the Holder’s rights as a Holder of such converted portion of this Note shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive certificates for such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in equity to such Holder because of a failure by the Borrower to comply with the terms of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder has not received certificates for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the expiration of the Deadline with respect to a conversion of any portion of this Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects to retain its status as a holder of Common Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Holder shall regain the rights of a Holder of this Note with respect to such unconverted portions of this Note and the Borrower shall, as soon as practicable, return such unconverted Note to the Holder or, if the Note has not been surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note has not been converted. In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right to receive Conversion Default Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such Conversion Default and any subsequent Conversion Default and (ii) the right to have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent conversions determined in accordance with Section 1.3) for the Borrower’s failure to convert this Note.\n\n1.8 _Prepayment_. The Borrower may at any time pay or prepay all or any portion of the amounts outstanding hereunder by making a payment to the Holder of an amount in cash equal to the sum of: (w) the then outstanding principal amount of this Note _plus_ (x) accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of this Note _plus_ (y) Default Interest, if any.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \nArticle II. CERTAIN COVENANTS\n\n2.1 _Distributions on Capital Stock_. So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation under this Note, the Borrower shall not without the Holder’s written consent (a) pay, declare or set apart for such payment, any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, property or other securities) on shares of capital stock other than dividends on shares of Common Stock solely in the form of additional shares of Common Stock or (b) directly or indirectly or through any subsidiary make any other payment or distribution in respect of its capital stock except for distributions pursuant to any shareholders’ rights plan which is approved by a majority of the Borrower’s disinterested directors.\n\n2.2 _Restriction on Stock Repurchases_. So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation under this Note, the Borrower shall not without the Holder’s written consent redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (whether for cash or in exchange for property or other securities or otherwise) in any one transaction or series of related transactions any shares of capital stock of the Borrower or any warrants, rights or options to purchase or acquire any such shares.\n\n2.3 _Borrowings_. So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation under this Note, the Borrower shall not, without the Holder’s written consent, create, incur, assume guarantee, endorse, contingently agree to purchase or otherwise become liable upon the obligation of any person, firm, partnership, joint venture or corporation, except by the endorsement of negotiable instruments for deposit or collection, or suffer to exist any liability for borrowed money, except (a) borrowings in existence or committed on the date hereof and of which the Borrower has informed Holder in writing prior to the date hereof, (b) indebtedness to trade creditors financial institutions or other lenders incurred in the ordinary course of business, (c) borrowings, the proceeds of which shall be used to repay this Note, (d) borrowings which are expressly subordinated to this Note, and (e) indebtedness incurred by the Borrower solely for the purposes of immediate material working capital needs. The Borrower shall use the proceeds from any offerings over $2,000,000 following the date hereof to repay this Note.\n\n2.4 _Sale of Assets_. So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation under this Note, the Borrower shall not, without the Holder’s written consent, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any significant portion of its assets outside the ordinary course of business. Any consent to the disposition of any assets shall be conditioned on a specified use of the proceeds towards the repayment of this Note.\n\n2.5 _Advances and Loans_. So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation under this Note, the Borrower shall not, without the Holder’s written consent, lend money, give credit or make advances to any person, firm, joint venture or corporation, including, without limitation, officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries and affiliates of the Borrower, except loans, credits or advances (a) in existence or committed on the date hereof and which the Borrower has informed Holder in writing prior to the date hereof, (b) made in the ordinary course of business or (c) not in excess of $100,000.\n\n2.6 _Intentionally Omitted_.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n2.7 _Preservation of Existence, etc._ The Borrower shall maintain and preserve, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain and preserve, its existence, rights and privileges, and become or remain, and cause each of its Subsidiaries (other than dormant Subsidiaries that have no or minimum assets) to become or remain, duly qualified and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary.\n\n2.8 _Non-circumvention_. The Borrower hereby covenants and agrees that the Borrower will not, by amendment of its Certificate or Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Note, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder.\n\nArticle III.

This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.

Whenever pursuant to this Note the Borrower is required to pay an amount in excess of the outstanding principal amount (or the portion thereof required to be paid at that time) plus accrued and unpaid interest plus Default Interest on such interest, the Borrower and the Holder agree that the actual damages to the Holder from the receipt of cash payment on this Note may be difficult to determine and the amount to be so paid by the Borrower represents stipulated damages and not a penalty and is intended to compensate the Holder in part for loss of the opportunity to convert this Note and to earn a return from the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion of this Note at a price in excess of the price paid for such shares pursuant to this Note. The Borrower and the Holder hereby agree that such amount of stipulated damages is not plainly disproportionate to the possible loss to the Holder from the receipt of a cash payment without the opportunity to convert this Note into shares of Common Stock.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \n4.8 _Purchase Agreement_.

If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury, the applicable provision shall automatically be revised to equal the maximum rate of interest or other amount deemed interest permitted under applicable law. The Borrower covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not seek to claim or take advantage of any law that would prohibit or forgive the Borrower from paying all or a portion of the principal or interest on this Note.\n\n4.11 _Remedies_. The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holder, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the Borrower acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies at law or in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction or injunctions restraining, preventing or curing any breach of this Note and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. No provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Borrower, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on, this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \n4.12 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Note is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any provision hereof which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof.\n\n4.13 _Dispute Resolution_. In the case of a dispute as to the determination of the Conversion Price, Conversion Amount, any prepayment amount or Default Amount, Default Sum, Closing or Maturity Date, the closing bid price, or fair market value (as the case may be) or the arithmetic calculation of the Conversion Price or the applicable prepayment amount(s) (as the case may be), the Borrower or the Holder shall submit the disputed determinations or arithmetic calculations via facsimile (i) within two (2) Business Days after receipt of the applicable notice giving rise to such dispute to the Borrower or the Holder or (ii) if no notice gave rise to such dispute, at any time after the Holder learned of the circumstances giving rise to such dispute.

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the Note, by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, without limitation, the issuance and reservation for issuance of the Conversion Shares) will not (i) conflict with or result in a violation of any provision of the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, or (ii) violate or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both could become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any agreement, indenture, patent, patent license or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (iii) result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (including federal and state securities laws and regulations and regulations of any self-regulatory organizations to which the Company or its securities are subject) applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected (except for such conflicts, defaults, terminations, amendments, accelerations, cancellations and violations as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of its Certificate or Articles of Incorporation, By-laws or other organizational documents and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default (and no event has occurred which with notice or lapse of time or both could put the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in default) under, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any action that would give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any agreement, indenture or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected, except for possible defaults as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC pursuant to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”) since February 29, 2024 (all of the foregoing filed prior to the date hereof and all exhibits included therein and financial statements and schedules thereto and documents (other than exhibits to such documents) incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter referred to herein as the “SEC Documents”). As a result of the May 3, 2024 BF Borgers SEC action and the inability of BF Borgers to appear or practice before the SEC, all of the Company’s financial statements, references and disclosures are specifically excluded from the definition of SEC Documents, the Company cannot rep or warrant to any such financial statements. The Company has provided access to the Buyer, through the SEC’s EDGAR database (www.sec.gov), true and complete copies of the SEC Documents, except for such exhibits and incorporated documents. As of their respective dates, the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to the SEC Documents, and none of the SEC Documents, at the time they were filed with the SEC, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except for the re-audit of the Company’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 and except for such statements as have been amended or updated in subsequent filings prior the date hereof).

Except as set forth in the financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents, the Company has no liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than (i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business subsequent to December 31, 2023, and (ii) obligations under contracts and commitments incurred in the ordinary course of business and not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected in such financial statements, which, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to the financial condition or operating results of the Company. The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the 1934 Act. For the avoidance of doubt, filing of the documents required in this Section 3(g) via the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (“EDGAR”) shall satisfy all delivery requirements of this Section 3(g).\n\n7  \n---  \n  \nh. _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since February 29, 2024, except as set forth in the SEC Documents and for the BF Borgers SEC action, there has been no material adverse change and no material adverse development in the assets, liabilities, business, properties, operations, financial condition, results of operations, prospects or 1934 Act reporting status of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\n\ni. _Absence of Litigation_.

Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents, there is no claim or action by any person pertaining to, or proceeding pending, or to the Company’s knowledge threatened, which challenges the right of the Company or of a Subsidiary with respect to any Intellectual Property necessary to enable it to conduct its business as now operated (and, as presently contemplated to be operated in the future); to the best of the Company’s knowledge, the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ current and intended products, services and processes do not infringe on any Intellectual Property or other rights held by any person; and the Company is unaware of any facts or circumstances which might give rise to any of the foregoing. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable security measures to protect the secrecy, confidentiality and value of their Intellectual Property.\n\nk. _No Materially Adverse Contracts, Etc_.

There are no unpaid taxes in any material amount claimed to be due by the taxing authority of any jurisdiction, and the officers of the Company know of no basis for any such claim. The Company has not executed a waiver with respect to the statute of limitations relating to the assessment or collection of any foreign, federal, state or local tax. None of the Company’s tax returns is presently being audited by any taxing authority.\n\nm. _Certain Transactions_. Except for arm’s length transactions pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes payments in the ordinary course of business upon terms no less favorable than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could obtain from third parties and other than the grant of stock options disclosed on Schedule 3(c) or in the SEC Documents, none of the officers, directors, or employees of the Company is presently a party to any transaction with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than for services as employees, officers and directors), including any contract, agreement or other arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or by, providing for rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise requiring payments to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to the knowledge of the Company, any corporation, partnership, trust or other entity in which any officer, director, or any such employee has a substantial interest or is an officer, director, trustee or partner.\n\nn. _Disclosure_. All information relating to or concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth in this Agreement is true and correct in all material respects and the Company has not omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made herein or therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No event or circumstance has occurred or exists with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their business, properties, prospects, operations or financial conditions, which, under applicable law, rule or regulation, requires public disclosure or announcement by the Company but which has not been so publicly announced or disclosed (assuming for this purpose that the Company’s reports filed under the 1934 Act are being incorporated into an effective registration statement filed by the Company under the 1933 Act).\n\no. _Acknowledgment Regarding Buyer’ Purchase of Securities_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer is acting solely in the capacity of arm’s length purchasers with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company further acknowledges that the Buyer is not acting as a financial advisor or fiduciary of the Company (or in any similar capacity) with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and any statement made by the Buyer or any of its representatives or agents in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is not advice or a recommendation and is merely incidental to the Buyer’ purchase of the Securities. The Company further represents to the Buyer that the Company’s decision to enter into this Agreement has been based solely on the independent evaluation of the Company and its representatives.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \np. _No Integrated Offering_. Neither the Company, nor any of its affiliates, nor any person acting on its or their behalf, has directly or indirectly made any offers or sales in any security or solicited any offers to buy any security under circumstances that would require registration under the 1933 Act of the issuance of the Securities to the Buyer. The issuance of the Securities to the Buyer will not be integrated with any other issuance of the Company’s securities (past, current or future) for purposes of any stockholder approval provisions applicable to the Company or its securities, unless required under Nasdaq rules.\n\nq. _Permits; Compliance_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (collectively, the “Company Permits”), and there is no action pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened regarding suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, any of the Company Permits, except for any such conflicts, defaults or violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Since January 31, 2024, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notification with respect to possible conflicts, defaults, or violations of applicable laws, except for notices relating to possible conflicts, defaults or violations, which conflicts, defaults or violations would not have a Material Adverse Effect.\n\nr. _Environmental Matters_.\n\n(i) There are, to the Company’s knowledge, with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor of the Company, no past or present violations of Environmental Laws (as defined below), releases of any material into the environment, actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events, incidents, or contractual obligations which may give rise to any common law environmental liability or any liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or similar federal, state, local or foreign laws and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice with respect to any of the foregoing, nor is any action pending or, to the Company’s knowledge, threatened in connection with any of the foregoing. The term “Environmental Laws” means all federal, state, local or foreign laws relating to pollution or protection of human health or the environment (including, without limitation, ambient air, surface water, groundwater, land surface or subsurface strata), including, without limitation, laws relating to emissions, discharges, releases or threatened releases of chemicals, pollutants contaminants, or toxic or hazardous substances or wastes (collectively, “Hazardous Materials”) into the environment, or otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Materials, as well as all authorizations, codes, decrees, demands or demand letters, injunctions, judgments, licenses, notices or notice letters, orders, permits, plans or regulations issued, entered, promulgated or approved thereunder.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n(ii) Other than those that are or were stored, used or disposed of in compliance with applicable law, to the Company’s knowledge, no Hazardous Materials are contained on or about any real property currently owned, leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no Hazardous Materials were released on or about any real property previously owned, leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the period the property was owned, leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the normal course of the Company’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ business.\n\n(iii) To the Company’s knowledge, there are no underground storage tanks on or under any real property owned, leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are not in compliance with applicable law.\n\ns. _Title to Property_. Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents, the Company and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title in fee simple to all real property and good and marketable title to all personal property owned by them which is material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and defects or such as would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Any real property and facilities held under lease by the Company and its Subsidiaries are held by them under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases with such exceptions as would not have a Material Adverse Effect.\n\nt. _Internal Accounting Controls_. Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents and consequences of the BF Borgers SEC action, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient, in the judgment of the Company’s board of directors, to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.\n\nu. _Foreign Corrupt Practices_. Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, agent, employee or other person acting on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary has, in the course of his actions for, or on behalf of, the Company, used any corporate funds for any unlawful contribution, gift, entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political activity; made any direct or indirect unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic government official or employee from corporate funds; violated or is in violation of any provision of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or made any bribe, rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback or other unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic government official or employee.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \nv. _Solvency_. The Company (after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) is solvent (_i.e._ , its assets have a fair market value in excess of the amount required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured) and currently the Company has no information that would lead it to reasonably conclude that the Company would not, after giving effect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, have the ability to, nor does it intend to take any action that would impair its ability to, pay its debts from time to time incurred in connection therewith as such debts mature. The Company did not receive a qualified opinion from its auditors with respect to its most recent fiscal year end other than with respect to its ability to continue as a “going concern” and, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, does not anticipate or know of any basis upon which its auditors might issue a qualified opinion in respect of its current fiscal year (other than with respect to its ability to continue as a “going concern”).\n\nw. _No Investment Company_. The Company is not, and upon the issuance and sale of the Securities as contemplated by this Agreement will not be an “investment company” required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (an “Investment Company”). The Company is not controlled by an Investment Company.\n\nx. _Insurance_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are insured by insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as management of the Company believes to be prudent and customary in the businesses in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are engaged. Neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Upon written request the Company will provide to the Buyer true and correct copies of all policies relating to directors’ and officers’ liability coverage, errors and omissions coverage, and commercial general liability coverage.\n\ny. _Bad Actor_. No officer or director of the Company would be disqualified under Rule 506(d) of the Securities Act as amended on the basis of being a “bad actor” as that term is established in the September 19, 2013 Small Entity Compliance Guide published by the SEC.\n\naa. _Shell Status_. The Company represents that it is not a “shell” issuer and that if it previously has been a “shell” issuer, that at least twelve (12) months have passed since the Company has reported Form 10 type information indicating that it is no longer a “shell” issuer. Further, the Company will instruct its counsel to either (i) write a 144- 3(a)(9) opinion to allow for salability of the Conversion Shares or (ii) accept such opinion from Holder’s counsel.\n\nbb. _No-Off Balance Sheet Arrangements_. There is no transaction, arrangement, or other relationship between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and an unconsolidated or other off balance sheet entity that is required to be disclosed by the Company in its 1934 Act filings and is not so disclosed or that otherwise could be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.\n\ncc. _Manipulation of Price_. The Company has not, and to its knowledge no one acting on its behalf has: (i) taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or to result, or that could reasonably be expected to cause or result, in the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of any of the Securities, (ii) sold, bid for, purchased, or paid any compensation for soliciting purchases of, any of the Securities, or (iii) paid or agreed to pay to any person any compensation for soliciting another to purchase any other securities of the Company.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \ndd. _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or employs any member of a union.

To the knowledge of the Company, no executive officer or other key employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is, or is now expected to be, in violation of any material term of any employment contract, confidentiality, disclosure or proprietary information agreement, non- competition agreement, or any other contract or agreement or any restrictive covenant, and the continued employment of each such executive officer or other key employee (as the case may be) does not subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any liability with respect to any of the foregoing matters. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations respecting labor, employment and employment practices and benefits, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, except where failure to be in compliance would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.\n\nff. _Breach of Representations and Warranties by the Company_.

The Company shall use the proceeds from the sale of the Note for working capital, other general corporate purposes, and shall not, directly or indirectly, use such proceeds for any loan to or investment in any other corporation, partnership, enterprise or other person (except in connection with its currently existing direct or indirect Subsidiaries).\n\ne. _The Buyer is Not a “Dealer”_. The Buyer and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree that the Buyer has not: (i) acted as an underwriter; (ii) acted as a market maker or specialist; (iii) acted as “de facto” market maker; or (iv) conducted any other professional market activities such as providing investment advice, extending credit and lending securities in connection; and thus that the Buyer is not a “Dealer” as such term is defined in the 1934 Act.\n\nf. _Expenses_.

Exercise of the purchase rights for Warrant Shares represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time or times on or after the Initial Issuance Date and on or before the Termination Date by delivery to the Company (or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder appearing on the books of the Company) of a duly executed Notice of Exercise in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A (which may be delivered in a .PDF format via electronic mail pursuant to the notice provisions set forth in the Purchase Agreement). Within two (2) Trading Days of the date said Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company (or within three (3) Trading Days of the date said Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company if the Notice of Exercise is received after 12 p.m. EST on such day), the Company shall have received payment of the aggregate Exercise Price of the Warrant Shares thereby purchased by wire transfer or cashier’s check drawn on a United States bank, unless such exercise is made pursuant to the cashless exercise procedure specified in _Section 2(c)_ below (if available). No ink-original Notice of Exercise shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Exercise form be required. The Company shall be entitled to conclusively assume the genuineness of any signature on any Notice of Exercise delivered to the Company pursuant to this _Section 2(a)_ , the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons signing any Notice of Exercise so delivered, the authenticity of any Notice of Exercise so delivered, the conformity to an authentic original of any Notice of Exercise so delivered as certified, authenticated, conformed, photostatic, facsimile, or electronic and the authenticity of the original of such Notice of Exercise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation within three (3) Trading Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases, and the Company shall be entitled to conclusively assume that its records of the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases are accurate, absent actual notice to the contrary. The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such notice. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.\n\nb) _Number of Warrant Shares_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Holder shall have the right to purchase from the Company seventy-two thousand one hundred sixty-five (72,165) Warrant Shares.\n\nc) _Exercise Price_. The exercise price per Warrant Share shall be $5.82 per share (the “ _Exercise Price_ ”).\n\n3  \n---  \n  \nd) _Cashless Exercise_. If at any time after the date of the Initial Issuance Date, there is no effective Registration Statement registering, or no current prospectus available for, the resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder, then this Warrant may also be exercised, in whole or in part, at such time by means of a “cashless exercise” in which the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:\n\n(A)=  | the Market Price (at the date of such calculation)  \n---|---  \n(B)=  | the Exercise Price of this Warrant, as adjusted hereunder; and  \n(X)=  | the number of Warrant Shares that would be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms of this Warrant if such exercise were by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise.  \n  \nAssuming (i) the Holder is not an Affiliate of the Company, and (ii) all of the applicable conditions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ _Securities Act_ ”) with respect to Holder and the Warrant Shares are met in the case of such a cashless exercise, the Company agrees that the Company will use its best efforts to cause the removal of the legend from such Warrant Shares (including by delivering an opinion of the Company’s counsel to the Company’s transfer agent at its own expense to ensure the foregoing), and the Company agrees that the Holder is under no obligation to sell the Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant prior to removing the legend. The Company expressly acknowledges that Rule 144(d)(3)(ii), as currently in effect, provides that Warrant Shares issued solely upon a cashless exercise shall be deemed to have been acquired at the same time as the Warrant. The Company agrees not to take any position contrary to this _Section 2(c)_.\n\ne) _Mechanics of Exercise_.\n\ni. _Delivery of Warrant Shares Upon Exercise_. The Company shall cause the Warrant Shares purchased hereunder to be transmitted by the Company’s transfer agent (the “ _Transfer Agent_ ”) to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder’s or its designee’s balance account with The Depository Trust Company through its Deposit or Withdrawal at Custodian system (“ _DWAC_ ”) if the Company is then a participant in such system and either (A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the Warrant Shares to or resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder or (B) the Warrant Shares are eligible for resale by the Holder pursuant to Rule 144, and otherwise by physical delivery of a certificate, registered in the Company’s share register in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Warrant Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise by the date that is one (1) Trading Day after the later of (A) the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise provided that such Notice of Exercise is received by 12 p.m. EST and two (2) Trading Days for any Notice of Exercise received after 12 p.m. EST, and (B) the Company’s receipt of payment of the aggregate Exercise Price of the Warrant Shares thereby purchased by wire transfer or cashier’s check drawn on a United States bank, unless such exercise is made pursuant to the cashless exercise procedure specified in _Section 2(c)_ (such date, the “ _Warrant Share Delivery Date_ ”). The Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised, with payment to the Company of the Exercise Price (or by cashless exercise, if permitted) and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, pursuant to _Section 2(d)(vi)_ prior to the issuance of such Warrant Shares, having been paid. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the Warrant Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise (based on the VWAP of the Common Stock on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $5 per Trading Day (increasing to $10 per Trading Day on the fifth Trading Day after such liquidated damages begin to accrue) for each Trading Day after such Warrant Share Delivery Date until such Warrant Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such exercise. The Company agrees to maintain a transfer agent that is a participant in the FAST program so long as this Warrant remains outstanding and exercisable.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \nii. _Delivery of New Warrants Upon Exercise_. If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the Warrant Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant.\n\niii. _Rescission Rights_. If the Holder fails to make payment of the aggregate Exercise Price of the Warrant Shares pursuant to a Notice of Exercise within two (2) Trading Days of the date said Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company (or within three (3) Trading Days of the date said Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company if the Notice of Exercise is received after 12 p.m. EST on such day) by wire transfer or cashier’s check drawn on a United States bank, then the Company will have the right to rescind such exercise, unless such exercise is made pursuant to the cashless exercise procedure specified in _Section 2(c)_. If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares pursuant to _Section 2(d)(i)_ by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind such exercise.\n\niv. _Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Warrant Shares Upon Exercise_. In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2(d)(i)_ above pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder’s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a “ _Buy-In_ ”), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s failure to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \nv. _No Fractional Shares or Scrip_. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share.\n\nvi. _Charges, Taxes, and Expenses_. Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of Warrant Shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such Warrant Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder; provided, however, that in the event that Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder and the Company may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The Company shall pay all fees charged by the Transfer Agent, including any fees assessed to the Transfer Agent by Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day processing of any Notice of Exercise and for same-day electronic delivery of the Warrant Shares.\n\nvii. _Closing of Books_. The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.\n\nf) _Holder’s Exercise Limitations_. To the extent the exercise of any portion of this Warrant requires the Company to receive the approval of the Company’s stockholders pursuant to NASDAQ Capital Market Listing Rules, the Company shall not effect such exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to exercise any such portion of this Warrant, pursuant to _Section 2_ or otherwise, until such approval has been received by the Company.\n\nSection 3. _Certain Adjustments_.\n\na) _Stock Dividends and Splits_. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues by reclassification of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this _Section 3(a)_ shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \nb) _Number of Warrant Shares_. Simultaneously with any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to _Section 3(a)_ , the number of Warrant Shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be increased or decreased proportionately, so that after such adjustment the aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder for the adjusted number of Warrant Shares shall be the same as the aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment (without regard to any limitations on exercise contained herein).\n\nc) _Notice_. The Company shall notify the Holder, in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance or deemed issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents subject to _Section 3(b)_ , indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms.\n\nd) _Fundamental Transaction_. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization, or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a “ _Fundamental Transaction_ ”), then, the Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the “ _Successor Entity_ ”) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3(e)_ pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents referring to the “Company” shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \ne) _Holder’s Right of Alternative Exercise Price Following Issuance of Certain Options or Convertible Securities_. In addition to, and not in limitation of, the other provisions of this _Section 3_ , excluding any Excluded Securities, if after the Closing Date, the Company in any manner issues or sells or enters into any agreement to issue or sell Options or Convertible Securities that contain terms, such as conversion rate or price adjustments, that offset, in whole or in part, declines in the market value of the Company’s Common Stock occurring prior to conversion or exchange (other than terms that adjust for share splits, share combinations, share dividends, or other Company-initiated changes in its capitalizations) (each of the formulations for such adjustments being herein referred to as, the “ _Variable Price_ ”, and any such securities, “ _Variable Price Securities_ ”), the Company shall provide written notice thereof via .PDF format via electronic mail pursuant to the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreement to the Holder on the date of such agreement and the issuance of such Convertible Securities or Options. From and after the date the Company enters into such agreement or issues any such Variable Price Securities, the Holder shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion, to substitute the Variable Price for the Exercise Price upon exercise of this Warrant by designating in the Notice of Exercise delivered upon any exercise of this Warrant that, solely for purposes of such exercise, the Holder is relying on the Variable Price rather than the Exercise Price then in effect. The Holder’s election to rely on a Variable Price for a particular exercise of this Warrant shall not obligate the Holder to rely on a Variable Price for any future exercises of this Warrant.\n\nf) _Calculations_. All calculations under this _Section 3_ shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this _Section 3_ , the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding.\n\ng) _Notice to Holder_.\n\ni. _Adjustment to Exercise Price_. Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this _Section 3_ , the Company shall promptly mail or deliver via electronic mail to the Holder a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \nii. _Notice to Allow Exercise by Holder_. If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights, or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided in this Warrant constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled to exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.\n\nSection 4. _Transfer of Warrant_.\n\na) _Transferability_. Subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws and the conditions set forth in _Section 4(d)_ hereof, this Warrant and all rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any registration rights) are transferable, in whole or in part, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated agent, together with a written assignment of this Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender and, if required, such payment, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company unless the Holder has assigned this Warrant in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company within three (3) Trading Days of the date the Holder delivers an assignment form to the Company assigning this Warrant in full. The Warrant, if properly assigned in accordance herewith, may be exercised by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant issued.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \nb) _New Warrants_. This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of the Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by the Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with _Section 4(a)_ , as to any transfer which may be involved in such division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the Initial Exercise Date and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant thereto.\n\nc) _Warrant Register_. The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the “ _Warrant Register_ ”), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the registered Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder, and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary.\n\nd) _Transfer Restrictions_. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law, this Warrant may be offered for sale, sold, transferred, or assigned without the consent of the Company.\n\ne) _Representation by the Holder_. The Holder, by the acceptance hereof, represents and warrants that it is acquiring this Warrant and, upon any exercise hereof, will acquire the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, for its own account and not with a view to or for distributing or reselling such Warrant Shares or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law, except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act.\n\nSection 5. _Miscellaneous_.\n\na) _No Rights as Stockholder Until Exercise_. This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights, dividends or other rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in _Section 2(d)(i)_.\n\nb) _Loss, Theft, Destruction, or Mutilation of Warrant_. The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case of the Warrant, shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate, if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate.\n\nc) _Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc_. If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding Business Day.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \nd) _Authorized Shares_. The Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this Warrant (the “ _Required Reserve Amount_ ”). The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of issuing the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Trading Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant and payment for such Warrant Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens, and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue).\n\ne) _Intentionally Omitted_.\n\nf) _Transfer Agent Instructions_. The Company covenants and agrees that it will, at all times during the period the Warrant is outstanding, maintain a duly qualified independent Transfer Agent. The Company represents and covenants that, within one (1) day from the Initial Exercise Date, it will either (i) issue irrevocable instructions to its current Transfer Agent (and each Transfer Agent appointed thereafter) to issue certificates, registered in the name of the Holder or its nominee, for the Warrant Shares in such amounts as specified from time to time by the Holder to the Company upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms thereof (the “ _Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions_ ”), or (ii) appoint a new Transfer Agent, at which time the Company (a) shall provide a copy of its agreement with the new Transfer Agent to the Holder, and (b) issue Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions to the new Transfer Agent. Such Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions shall be in a form acceptable to the Holder and shall include a provision to irrevocably reserve the Required Reserve Amount. The Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions shall be signed by the Company’s Transfer Agent as of the date of the Initial Exercise Date or by the New Transfer Agent, as applicable, and by the Company. The Company warrants that, (i) no instruction other than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions referred to in this Section 5(e), and stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 5(g) (prior to registration of the Warrant Shares under the Securities Act or the date on which the Warrant Shares may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of Securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold), will be given by the Company to its Transfer Agent and that the Warrant Shares shall otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of the Company as and to the extent provided in this Warrant and the Purchase Agreement, (ii) it will not direct its Transfer Agent not to transfer or delay, impair, and/or hinder its Transfer Agent in transferring (or issuing)(electronically or in certificated form) any certificate for Warrant Shares to be issued to the Holder upon exercise of or otherwise pursuant to this Warrant as and when required by this Warrant and the Purchase Agreement, and (iii) it will not fail to remove (or direct its Transfer Agent not to remove or impair, delay, and/or hinder its Transfer Agent from removing) any restrictive legend (or to withdraw any stop transfer instructions in respect thereof) on any certificate for any Warrant Shares issued to the Holder upon exercise of or otherwise pursuant to this Warrant as and when required by this Warrant and the Purchase Agreement. Nothing in this Section shall affect in any way the Holder’s obligations to comply with all applicable prospectus delivery requirements, if any, upon resale of the Warrant Shares. If a Holder provides the Company, at the cost of the Holder, with an opinion of counsel in form, substance, and scope customary for opinions in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Warrant Shares may be made without registration under the Securities Act and such sale or transfer is effected, the Company shall permit the transfer, and, in the case of the Warrant Shares, promptly instruct its Transfer Agent to issue one or more certificates, free from restrictive legend, in such name and in such denominations as specified by the Holder. The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holder, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the Company acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Section 5(e) may be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Company of the provisions of this Section, that the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach and requiring immediate transfer, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \ng) _Jurisdiction_. All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement, and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.\n\nh) _Restrictions_. The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered, will have restrictions upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws.\n\ni) _Nonwaiver and Expenses_. No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder’s rights, powers, or remedies, notwithstanding the fact that all rights hereunder terminate on the Termination Date. If the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant, which results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, including those of appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder.\n\nj) _Notices_. Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall be delivered in accordance with the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreement.\n\nk) _Limitation of Liability_. No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company or by creditors of the Company.\n\nl) _Remedies_. The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.\n\nm) _Successors and Assigns_. Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares.\n\nn) _Amendment_. This Warrant (other than _Section 2(e)_) may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and the Holder. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \no) _Severability_. If any provision of this Warrant is prohibited by law or otherwise determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision that would otherwise be prohibited, invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed amended to apply to the broadest extent that it would be valid and enforceable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Warrant so long as this Warrant as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the prohibited nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question does not substantially impair the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of the parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be conferred upon the parties. The parties will endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s) with a valid provision(s), the effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s).\n\np) _Headings_. This Warrant shall be deemed to be jointly drafted by the Company and the Holder and shall not be construed against any Person as the drafter hereof. The headings of this Warrant are for convenience of reference and shall not form part of, or affect the interpretation of, this Warrant. Terms used in this Warrant but defined in the other Transaction Documents shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms on the Closing Date in such other Transaction Documents unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Holder.\n\nq) _Governing Law_. This Warrant shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with, and all questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation, and performance of this Warrant shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware. The Company hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action, or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof to the Company at the address set forth in the Purchase Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof.\n\nr) _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each party hereby irrevocably submits that any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Warrant, shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof to such party at the address for such notices to it under the Purchase Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR\n\nARISING OUT OF THIS WARRANT. The parties agree that all dispute resolution proceedings in accordance with this Section 5(o) may be conducted in a virtual setting.\n\n_(Signature Page Follows)_\n\n13  \n---  \n  \nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Warrant to be executed by its officer thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above indicated.\n\nAMERICAN REBEL HOLDINGS, INC.  \n---  \nBy:  | _/s/ Charles A.

These forward-looking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections. We may use words such as “may,” “could,” “should,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “project,” “position,” “intend,” “target,” “plan,” “seek,” “believe,” “foresee,” “outlook,” “estimate” and variations of these words and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\n● | our ability to efficiently manage and repay our debt obligations;  \n---|---  \n● | we recently consummated the purchase of our safe manufacturer and sales organizations, and future acquisitions and operations of new manufacturing facilities and/or sales organizations might prove unsuccessful and could fail;  \n● | our inability to raise additional financing for working capital, especially related to purchasing critical inventory;  \n● | our ability to generate sufficient revenue in our targeted markets to support operations;  \n● | significant dilution resulting from our financing activities:  \n● | actions and initiatives taken by both current and potential competitors;  \n● | shortages of components and materials, as well as supply chain disruptions, may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our results of operations;  \n● | we do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and their ability to cancel, reduce, or delay orders could reduce our revenue and increase our costs;  \n● | our success depends on our ability to introduce new products that track customer preferences;  \n● | if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may lose a competitive advantage or incur substantial litigation costs to protect our rights;  \n● | as a significant portion of our revenues are derived by demand for our safes and the personal security products for firearms storage, we depend on the availability and regulation of ammunition and firearm storage;  \n● | as we continue to integrate the recent purchase of our safe manufacturer and sales organization, any compromised operational capacity may affect our ability to meet the demand for our safes, which in turn may affect our generation of revenue;  \n● | our future operating results;  \n● | our ability to diversify our operations;  \n● | our inability to effectively meet our short- and long-term obligations;  \n● | the fact that our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain;  \n● | given our limited corporate history it is difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects and increases the risks associated with an investment in our securities;  \n● | adverse state or federal legislation or regulation that increases the costs of compliance, or adverse findings by a regulator with respect to existing operations;  \n● | changes in generally accepted accounting policies in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) or in the legal, regulatory and legislative environments in the markets in which we operate;  \n● | deterioration in general or global economic, market and political conditions;  \n● | inability to efficiently manage our operations;  \n● | inability to achieve future operating results;  \n● | the unavailability of funds for capital expenditures;  \n● | our ability to recruit and hire key employees;  \n● | the global impact of COVID-19 on the United States economy and our operations;  \n● | the inability of management to effectively implement our strategies and business plans;  \n● | our business prospects;  \n  \ni  \n---  \n  \n● | any contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;  \n---|---  \n● | the dependence of our future success on the general economy;  \n● | any possible financings; and  \n● | the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital.  \n  \nBecause the factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. New factors emerge from time to time, and their emergence is impossible for us to predict. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n\nThe specific discussions herein about our company include financial projections and future estimates and expectations about our company’s business. The projections, estimates and expectations are presented in this offering circular only as a guide about future possibilities and do not represent actual amounts or assured events. All the projections and estimates are based exclusively on our company management’s own assessment of its business, the industry in which it works and the economy at large and other operational factors, including capital resources and liquidity, financial condition, fulfillment of contracts and opportunities. The actual results may differ significantly from the projections.\n\n**Market and Industry Data**\n\nThe market and industry data used in this report are based on independent industry publications, customers, trade or business organizations, reports by market research firms and other published statistical information from third parties (collectively, the “Third Party Information”), as well as information based on management’s good faith estimates, which we derive from our review of internal information and independent sources.

We currently operate primarily as a designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded safes and personal security and self-defense products. American Rebel acquired Champion Safe Company, Inc., a Utah corporation (“Champion Safe”), and its associated entities on July 29, 2022. This acquisition dramatically grew the Company’s revenues and built a solid base to position the Company for future growth. Additionally, the Company designs and produces branded apparel and accessories. On August 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Brewing Agreement (the “Brewing Agreement”) with Associated Brewing Company, a Minnesota limited liability company (“Associated Brewing”). Under the terms of the Brewing Agreement, Associated Brewing has been appointed as the exclusive producer and seller of American Rebel branded spirits, with the initial product being American Rebel Light Beer (“American Rebel Beer”). American Rebel Beer plans to launch regionally in early 2024. The beer industry in the United States is a more than $110 billion dollar market. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to enter the beer market at this time to present our customers with a beer they can support that aligns with their values.\n\nWe believe American Rebel is boldly positioning itself as “America’s Patriotic Brand” in a time when national spirit and American values are being rekindled and redefined. The typical American Rebel customer loves their family, their country and their community. We believe the time is right for American Rebel Beer, we believe we have the right expertise, and we believe we have the right brand. We believe recent trends have revealed that beer consumers want to express their values through their choice of beer. We believe that American Rebel Beer will have a receptive target audience for our product. American Rebel Light Beer will be the first product introduced on a regional basis, with plans to launch in early 2024. Consumers are already registering their email addresses at _www.AmericanRebelBeer.com_ to be notified when American Rebel Beer is available in their local market. We are also offering our American Rebel Beer can cooler as a free incentive to visit our website.\n\nOur safes have an established legacy of quality and craftsmanship since Champion Safe was founded in 1999. We believe that when it comes to their homes, consumers place a premium on their security and privacy. Our products are designed to offer our customers convenient, efficient and secure home and personal safes from a provider that they can trust. We are committed to offering products of enduring quality that allow customers to keep their valuable belongings protected and to express their patriotism and style, which is synonymous with the American Rebel brand.\n\nOur safes and personal security products are constructed primarily of U.S.-made steel. We believe our products are designed to safely store firearms, as well as store our customers’ priceless keepsakes, family heirlooms and treasured memories and other valuables, and we aim to make our products accessible at various price points for home and office use. We believe our products are designed for safety, quality, reliability, features and performance.\n\nTo enhance the strength of our brand and drive product demand, we work with our manufacturing facilities and various suppliers to emphasize product quality and mechanical development in order to improve the performance and affordability of our products while providing support to our distribution channel and consumers. We seek to sell products that offer features and benefits of higher-end safes at mid-line price ranges.\n\nWe believe that safes are becoming a ‘must-have appliance’ in a significant portion of households in the United States. We believe our current safes provide safety, security, style and peace of mind at competitive prices.\n\n1  \n---  \n  \nIn addition to branded safes, we offer an assortment of personal security products as well as apparel and accessories for men and women under the Company’s American Rebel brand. Our backpacks utilize what we believe is a distinctive sandwich-method concealment pocket, which we refer to as Personal Protection Pocket, to hold firearms in place securely and safely. The concealment pockets on our Freedom 2.0 Concealed Carry Jackets incorporate a silent operation opening and closing with the use of a magnetic closure.\n\nWe believe that we have the potential to continue to create a brand community presence around the core ideals and beliefs of America, in part through our Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. “Andy” Ross, Jr., who has written, recorded and performs a number of songs about the American spirit of independence. We believe our customers identify with the values expressed by our Chief Executive Officer through the “American Rebel” brand.\n\nThrough our growing network of dealers, we promote and sell our products in select regional retailers and local specialty safe, sporting goods, hunting and firearms stores, as well as online, including our website and e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com.\n\nAmerican Rebel is an advocate for the 2nd Amendment and conveys a sense of responsibility to teach and preach good common practices of gun ownership. American Rebel products keep our customers concealed and safe both inside and outside the home. American Rebel Safes protect our customers’ firearms and valuables from children, theft, fire and natural disasters inside the home; and American Rebel Concealed Carry Products provide quick and easy access to our customers’ firearms utilizing American Rebel’s Proprietary Protection Pocket in its backpacks and apparel outside the home. Our concealed carry product releases embrace the “concealed carry lifestyle” with a focus on personal security and defense.\n\nThe Company’s “concealed carry lifestyle” motto refers to a set of products and a set of ideas around the emotional decision to carry a gun everywhere a customer goes. The American Rebel brand strategy is similar to the successful Harley-Davidson Motorcycle philosophy, referenced in this quote from Richard F. Teerlink, Harley’s chairman and former chief executive, “It’s not hardware; it is a lifestyle, an emotional attachment. That’s what we have to keep marketing to.” As an American icon, we believe Harley-Davidson Motorcycle has come to symbolize freedom, rugged individualism, excitement and a sense of “bad boy rebellion.” We believe American Rebel has significant potential for branded products as a lifestyle brand. We believe our Concealed Carry Product line and Safe line serve a large and growing market segment; but it is important to note we have product opportunities beyond Concealed Carry Products and Safes. One of these opportunities is American Rebel Beer, offering beer consumers a chance to celebrate life and celebrate freedom.\n\n![](form253g2_003.jpg)\n\n**Recent Events**\n\n_American Rebel Beer_\n\nOn August 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Brewing Agreement with Associated Brewing. Under the terms of the Brewing Agreement, Associated Brewing has been appointed as the exclusive producer and seller of American Rebel branded spirits, with the initial product being American Rebel Light Beer. American Rebel Light Beer will launch regionally in early 2024. \n\n_Acquisition of Champion Entities_\n\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company entered into a stock and membership interest purchase agreement with Champion Safe, Superior Safe, LLC (“Superior Safe”), Safe Guard Security Products, LLC (“Safe Guard”), Champion Safe De Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (“Champion Safe Mexico” and, together with Champion Safe, Superior Safe, Safe Guard, and Champion Safe Mexico, collectively, the “Champion Entities”) and Mr. Ray Crosby (“Seller”) (the “Champion Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and membership interests of the Champion Entities from the Seller. This transaction was completed on July 29, 2022. We have included the Champion Entities assets and liabilities as of that date and the subsequent financial activity through the date of this offering circular in our consolidated financial statements which consist of the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statement of operations, consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity (deficit) and consolidated statement of cash flows (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). The Champion Entities have been integrated with our existing operations and are under the control of our management team.\n\n2  \n---  \n  \nThe closing contemplated by the Champion Purchase Agreement occurred on July 29, 2022. Under the terms of the Champion Purchase Agreement, the Company paid the Seller (i) cash consideration in the amount of $9,150,000, along with (ii) cash deposits previously paid of $350,000, and (iii) reimbursement to the Seller for $397,420 of agreed upon acquisitions and equipment purchases completed by the Seller and the Champion Entities since June 30, 2021.\n\n**Our Competition**\n\n_Safes_ - The North American safe industry is dominated by a small number of companies. We compete primarily on the quality, safety, reliability, features, performance, brand awareness, and price of our products. Our primary competitors include companies such as Liberty Safe, Fort Knox Security Products, American Security, Sturdy Safe Company, Homeland Security Safes, SentrySafe, as well as certain other domestic manufacturers, as well as certain China-based manufactured safes. Safes manufactured in China, including Steelwater and Alpha-Guardian, were subject to import tariffs initiated under the administration of former U.S President Donald Trump and continued during the first half of the current administration. We believe that given the current substantial uncertainty related to the supply chain and delivery of international goods, we have a competitive advantage because our safes are not manufactured overseas. Our higher end safes and vault doors are made in the USA in our Provo, UT manufacturing facility, which we believe resonates with our customer base. Our middle and value line safes are made with USA made steel in our manufacturing facility in Nogales, Mexico. We believe the combination of having all our safes made with USA made steel along with our higher end safes and vault doors being made in America put the Company in a strong position against our competitors because we do not rely on importing safes from China and US-made steel is the strongest steel available. Chinese imports are less appealing due to rising raw material and labor costs in China as well as the ever-present risk that tariffs could be reinstated at any time. \n\n![](form253g2_004.jpg)\n\n_Beer_ - The Beer industry in the United States is highly competitive due to large domestic and international brewers and the increasing number of craft brewers in this category who distribute similar products that have similar pricing and target beer drinkers. The two largest brewers in the United States, AB InBev and Molson Coors, participate actively in mass appeal beer offerings as well as the high end and beyond beer categories, through numerous hard seltzers, flavored malt beverages, and spirit ready to drink packaged beverages, or RTDs, from existing beer brands or new brands, importing and distributing import brands, and with their own domestic specialty beers, either by developing new brands or by acquiring, in whole or part, existing brands. Imported beers, such as Corona®, Heineken®, Modelo Especial® and Stella Artois®, continue to compete aggressively in the United States and have gained market share over the last ten years. All of these companies have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company. We believe our brand positioning will present opportunities for us to compete in this crowded marketplace. American Rebel won’t be all things to all people; but we do believe we can be important to a large potential market.\n\n**Our Competitive Strengths**\n\nWe believe we are progressing toward long-term, sustainable growth, and our business has, and our future success will be driven by, the following competitive strengths:\n\n● Powerful Brand Identity – We believe we have developed a distinctive brand that sets us apart from our competitors. This has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our brand is predicated on patriotism and quintessential American character: protecting our loved ones and expressing one’s values and beliefs. We strive to equip our safes with technologically advanced features, improved designs and accessory benefits that offer customers advanced security to provide the peace of mind they need. Our beer offerings are formulated for the mass appeal beer market and our can will boldly proclaim the drinker’s values as we believe the beer consumer has an almost unlimited number of options, but actually very few beer choices that clearly convey the drinker’s values. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the “American Rebel” brand is critical to expanding our loyal enthusiasts base, network of dealers, distributors and other partners. Through our beer, our safes, and branded apparel and accessories, we seek to further enhance our connection with the American Rebel community and share the values of patriotism and safety for which our Company stands for. We strive to continue to meet their need for our safes and our success will depend largely on our ability to maintain customer trust, become a gun safe storage leader and continue to provide high-quality safes. Introducing American Rebel Beer will further expand our brand identity due to the size and potential customer base available to us in the beer market.\n\n3  \n---  \n  \n● Beverage Operations – We believe that our agreement with Associated Brewing provides an operational advantage for American Rebel Beer. Associated Brewing is a premier beverage partner that provides turn-key operational support for American Rebel Beer. Associated Brewing’s resources and expertise jump-start American Rebel’s entry into the beer market providing a base of initial scale for the Company to utilize to enter this new market.\n\n● Safe Product Design and Development – Our current safe models rely on time-tested features, such as Four-Way Active Boltworks, pinning the door shut on all four sides (compared to Three-Way Bolt works, which is prevalent in many of our competitors’ safes), and benefits that would not often be available in our price point, including 12-gauge and heavier US-made steel. The sleek exterior of our American Rebel safes has garnered attention and earned the moniker from our dealers as the “safe with an attitude.” When we set out to enter the safe market, we wanted to offer a safe that we would want to buy, one that would get our attention and provide excellent value for the cost. Our Champion and Superior safes draw on decades of exemplary craftsmanship and dependability. Champion Safe – Built Up to a Standard, Not Down to a Price.\n\n● Focus on Safe Product Performance – Since the introduction of our first safes, we have maintained a singular focus on creating a full range of safe, quality, reliable safes that were designed to help our customers keep their family and valuables safe at all times. We incorporate advanced features into our safes that are designed to improve strength and durability. Key elements of our current model safes’ performance include:\n\nDouble Plate Steel Door - 4 ½” Thick\n\nReinforced Door Edge – 7/16” Thick\n\nDouble-Steel Door Casement\n\nSteel Walls – 11-Gauge\n\nDiameter Door Bolts – 1 ¼” Thick\n\nFour-Way Active Boltworks – AR-50(14), AR-40(12), AR-30(10), AR-20(10), AR-15(8), AR-12(8)\n\nDiamond-Embedded Armor Plate\n\n* Double Plate Steel Door is formed from two U.S.-made steel plates with fire insulation sandwiched inside. Thicker steel is placed on the outside of the door while the inner steel provides additional door rigidity and attachment for the locking mechanism and bolt works. The door edge is reinforced with up to four layers of laminated steel. Pursuant to industry-standard strength tests performed, this exclusive design offers up to 16 times greater door strength and rigidity than the “thin metal bent to look thick” doors.\n\n* Double-Steel Door Casement is formed from two or more layers of steel and is welded around the perimeter of the door opening. Pursuant to industry-standard strength tests performed, it more than quadruples the strength of the door opening and provides a more secure and pry-resistant door mounting. Our manufacturer installs a Double-Steel Door Casement™ on our safes. We believe the reinforced door casement feature provides important security as the safe door is often a target for break-in attempts.\n\n* Diamond-Embedded Armor Plate Industrial diamond is bonded to a tungsten steel alloy hard plate. Diamond is harder than either a cobalt or carbide drill. If drilling is attempted the diamond removes the cutting edge from the drill, thus dulling the drill bit to where it will not cut.\n\n● Trusted Brand – We believe that we have trusted brands with both retailers and consumers for delivering reliable, secure safe solutions.\n\n● Customer Satisfaction – We believe we have established a reputation for delivering high-quality safes and personal security products in a timely manner, in accordance with regulatory requirements and our retailers’ delivery requirements and supporting our products with a consistent merchandising and marketing message. We also believe that our high level of service, combined with strong consumer demand for our products and our focused distribution strategy, produces substantial customer satisfaction and loyalty. We also believe we have cultivated an emotional connection with the brand which symbolizes a lifestyle of freedom, rugged individualism, excitement and a sense of bad boy rebellion.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \n● Proven Management Team – Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. “Andy” Ross, Jr., has led the expansion and focus on the select product line we offer today. We believe that Mr. Ross had, and continues to have, an immediate and positive impact on our brand, products, team members, and customers. Under Mr. Ross’s leadership, we believe that we have built a strong brand and strengthened the management team. We are refocusing on the profitability of our products, reinforcing the quality of safes to engage customers and drive sales. We believe our management team possesses an appropriate mix of skills, broad range of professional experience, and leadership designed to drive board performance and properly oversee the interests of the Company, including our long-term corporate strategy. We believe our management team also reflects a balanced approach to tenure that will allow the Board to benefit from a mix of newer members who bring fresh perspectives and seasoned directors who bring continuity and a deep understanding of our complex business. Associated Brewing provides expertise in the beverage industry which is anticipated to increase our efficiency in our American Rebel Beer launch, and they are very excited about the American Rebel brand, marketing abilities and market opportunity. Associated Brewing and their affiliate copackers have significant capacity to supply American Rebel Beer.\n\n![](form253g2_005.jpg)\n\n**Our Growth Strategy**\n\nOur goal is to enhance our position as a designer, producer and marketer of premium safes and personal security products. In addition, we recently announced we are entering the beverage business, through the introduction of American Rebel Beer. We have established plans to grow our business by focusing on three key areas: (1) organic growth and expansion in existing markets; (2) targeted strategic acquisitions that increase our on-premise and online product offerings, distributor and retail footprint and/or have the ability to increase and improve our manufacturing capabilities and output, and (3) expanding the scope of our operation activities to new applications and new business categories.\n\nWe have developed what we believe is a multi-pronged growth strategy, as described below, to help us capitalize on a sizable opportunity. Through methodical sales and marketing efforts, we believe we have implemented several key initiatives we can use to grow our business more effectively. We believe we made significant progress in 2023 in the largest growing segment of the safe industry, sales to first-time buyers. We also intend to opportunistically pursue the strategies described below to continue our upward trajectory and enhance stockholder value. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are as follows:\n\n_Organic Growth and Expansion in Existing Markets - Build our Core Business_\n\nThe cornerstone of our business has historically been our safe product offerings. We are focused on continuing to develop our home, office and personal safe product lines. We are investing in adding what we believe are distinctive and advanced technological solutions for our safes and protective product lines.\n\nWe are working to increase floor space dedicated to our safes and strengthen our online presence in order to expand our reach to new enthusiasts and build our devoted American Rebel community. We intend to continue to endeavor to create and provide retailers and customers with what we believe are responsible, safe, reliable and stylish products, and we expect to concentrate on tailoring our supply and distribution logistics in response to the specific demands of our customers. We pledge to our customers to fight to protect their privacy just as we would fight to protect our own privacy. Customers purchase our safes with an expectation of security and privacy and we have to live up to their trust placed in us and fight for them.\n\nAdditionally, our Concealed Carry Product line and Safe line serve a large market segment. We believe that interest in safes increases, as well as in our complimentary concealed carry backpacks and apparel as a byproduct, when interest of the general population in firearms increases. To this extent, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which we believe serves as a proxy for gun sales since a background check is generally needed to purchase a firearm, reported a record number of background checks in 2020, 39,695,315. The prior annual record for background checks was 2019’s 28,369,750. In 2021, there were 38,876,673 background checks conducted, similar to that of 2020’s annual record which was 40% higher than the previous annual record in 2019. Background checks in 2023 are continuing on a pace to exceed the 2019 totals as well. While we do not expect this increase in background checks to necessarily translate to an equivalent number of additional safes purchased, we do believe it might be an indicator of the increased demand in the safe market. In addition, certain states (such as Massachusetts, California, New York and Connecticut) are starting to legislate new storage requirements in respect of firearms, which is expected to have a positive impact on the sale of safes. We have also recognized a growth in first-time gun buyers and their propensity to purchase a gun safe simultaneously with their first-time gun purchase. The previous trend was that gun buyers would wait to purchase a gun safe until multiple firearms were owned.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \nWe continue to strive to strengthen our relationships and our brand awareness with our current distributors, dealers, manufacturers, specialty retailers and consumers and to attract other distributors, dealers, and retailers. We believe that the success of our efforts depends on the distinctive features, quality, and performance of our products; continued manufacturing capabilities and meeting demand for our safes; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising programs; and the dedicated customer support.\n\nIn addition, we seek to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty by offering distinctive, high-quality products on a timely and cost-attractive basis and by offering efficient customer service. We regard the features, quality, and performance of our products as the most important components of our customer satisfaction and loyalty efforts, but we also rely on customer service and support for growing our business.\n\nFurthermore, we intend to continue improving our business operations, including research and development, component sourcing, production processes, marketing programs, and customer support. Thus, we are continuing our efforts to enhance our production by increasing daily production quantities through equipment acquisitions, expanded shifts and process improvements, increased operational availability of our equipment, reduced equipment down times, and increased overall efficiency.\n\nWe believe that by enhancing our brand recognition, our market share might grow correspondingly. Champion Safe and its legacy of nearly 25 years of craftsmanship and quality position its products as viable alternatives to Liberty Safe product. Firearm industry sources estimate that 70 million to 80 million people in the United States own an aggregate of more than 400 million firearms, creating a large potential market for our safes and personal security products. We are focusing on the premium segment of the market through the quality, distinctiveness, and performance of our products; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising efforts; and the attractiveness of our competitive pricing strategies.\n\n_Targeted Strategic Acquisitions for Long-term Growth_\n\nWe are consistently evaluating and considering acquisition opportunities that fit our overall growth strategy as part of our corporate mission to accelerate long-term value for our stockholders and create integrated value chains.\n\n![](form253g2_006.jpg)\n\n_Expand into New Business Categories_\n\nWe recently entered into an agreement to introduce American Rebel Beer as a new product offering, which is anticipated to launch regionally in early 2024. The Company has strived to be innovative, building products around its brand, and is committed to becoming a leading innovator in the industries in which it competes. To that end, the Company plans to continually test new alcohol beverages and may sell them under various brand labels for evaluation of drinker interest. The Company will also continue to consider new markets for its safe products and new product applications. The Company has already identified opportunities in the cannabis industry to lock inventory after hours as well as locking cabinets for tools and automotive parts in garages. Also, Champion Safe has focused on the middle and premium segments of the safe market. We believe introducing a value line series will grow customer and dealer loyalty to our brands as nearly 60% of current safe industry sales are going to value line products. We believe our value line product will have features and benefits other value line safes won’t offer and that our value line safe will be a better product.\n\n**Our Risks and Challenges**\n\nOur prospects should be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by similar companies. Our ability to realize our business objectives and execute our strategies is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the following:\n\n● | we recently consummated the purchase of our safe manufacturer and sales organizations, and future acquisitions and operations of new manufacturing facilities and/or sales organizations might prove unsuccessful and could fail;  \n---|---  \n  \n6  \n---  \n  \n● | our success depends on our ability to introduce new products that track customer preferences;  \n---|---  \n● | We face substantial risks relating to our planned entry into the beer and alcoholic beverage market;  \n● | we may be unsuccessful introducing new products, thereby increasing our expenditures without corresponding increases in our revenues;  \n● | if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may lose a competitive advantage or incur substantial litigation costs to protect our rights;  \n● | as a significant portion of our revenues are derived by demand for our safes and the personal security products for firearms storage, we depend on the availability and regulation of ammunition and firearm storage;  \n● | as we continue to integrate the recent purchase of our safe manufacturer and sales organization, any compromised operational capacity may affect our ability to meet the demand for our safes, which in turn may affect our generation of revenue;  \n● | shortages of components and materials, as well as supply chain disruptions, may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our results of operations;  \n● | we do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and their ability to cancel, reduce, or delay orders could reduce our revenue and increase our costs;  \n● | our inability to effectively meet our short- and long-term obligations;  \n● | given our limited corporate history it is difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects and increases the risks associated with an investment in our securities;  \n●  | our inability to raise additional financing for working capital;  \n●  | our ability to generate sufficient revenue in our targeted markets to support operations;  \n●  | significant dilution resulting from our financing activities;  \n●  | the actions and initiatives taken by both current and potential competitors;  \n●  | our ability to diversify our operations;  \n●  | the fact that our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain;  \n●  | changes in U.S. GAAP or in the legal, regulatory and legislative environments in the markets in which we operate;  \n●  | the deterioration in general of global economic, market and political conditions;  \n●  | the inability to efficiently manage our operations;  \n●  | the inability to achieve future operating results;  \n●  | the unavailability of funds for capital expenditures;  \n●  | the inability of management to effectively implement our strategies and business plans; and  \n  \nIn addition, we face other risks and uncertainties that may materially affect our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.

If any of the following events occur, our financial condition, business and results of operations (including cash flows) may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the value of your shares of Series C Preferred Stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment._\n\n**OUR SECURITIES INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND, THEREFORE, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED EXTREMELY SPECULATIVE. THEY SHOULD NOT BE PURCHASED BY PERSONS WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE POSSIBILITY OF THE LOSS OF THE ENTIRE INVESTMENT.**\n\n**RISKS RELATED TO THE BEER INDUSTRY**\n\n**_The Company faces substantial competition within the beer industry._**\n\nThe beer categories within the United States are highly competitive due to the participation of large domestic and international brewers in the categories and the increasing number of craft brewers and craft distilleries, who distribute similar beers we plan on selling and that have similar pricing and target drinkers.\n\nThe two largest brewers in the United States, AB InBev and Molson Coors, participate actively in mass appeal beer offerings as well as the High End and Beyond Beer categories, through numerous launches of new hard seltzers, flavored malt beverages and spirit RTDs from existing brands or new brands, importing and distributing import brands, and with their own domestic specialty beers, either by developing new brands or by acquiring, in whole or part, existing brands. Imported beers, such as Corona®, Heineken®, Modelo Especial® and Stella Artois®, continue to compete aggressively in the United States and have gained market share over the last ten years. All of these brands and companies have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company. The Company anticipates competition to be strong as some existing beverage companies are building more capacity, expanding geographically and adding more SKUs and styles. The potential for growth in the sales of hard seltzers, flavored malt beverages, craft-brewed domestic beers, imported beers and spirits RTDs is expected to increase the competition in the market for beer occasions within the United States and, as a result, the Company anticipates it will face competitive pricing pressures and the demand for and market share of the Company’s products, when introduced, may fluctuate and possibly decline.\n\nThe Company’s products, when introduced, will compete generally with other alcoholic beverages. The Company anticipates competing with other beer and beverage companies not only for drinker acceptance and loyalty, but also for traditional retail shelf, cold box and tap space, as well as e-commerce placement and for marketing focus by the Company’s Distributors and their customers, when established, all of which are anticipated to distribute and sell other alcoholic beverage products. All of the Company’s potential competitors at this point in time have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company. Moreover, the introduction of new products by competitors that compete directly with the Company’s intended products or that diminish the importance of the Company’s anticipated products to retailers or Distributors may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results.\n\nFurther, the alcoholic beverage industry has also seen continued consolidation among brewers in order to take advantage of cost savings opportunities for supplies, distribution and operations. Also, in the last several years, both AB InBev and Molson Coors have introduced numerous new hard seltzers and purchased multiple regional craft breweries and craft distilleries with the intention to expand the capacity and distribution of these brands.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \nMore recently in 2021 and into 2022, large non-alcoholic beverage companies including Coca-Cola Company (“Coke”), Pepsi and Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”) have begun to enter these markets through licensing agreements with alcoholic beverage companies to develop alcohol versions of existing traditional non-alcohol brands. Coke has entered into agreements with Molson Coors to develop, market and sell Topo Chico brand Hard Seltzer and Simply Spiked Lemonade. Coke also announced agreements with Constellation to develop, market and sell FRESCA™ Mixed, a line of spirits RTDs and with Brown Forman to develop, market and sell Jack Daniel’s® Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola®™ Ready-to-Drink Cocktail. The Boston Brewing Company has entered into an agreement with Pepsi to develop, market and sell alcohol beverages which include Hard Mountain Dew, to take advantage of this trend. Pepsi also entered an agreement in late 2022 with FIFCO USA, a New York based brewery, to develop, market and sell Lipton Hard Iced Tea which launched in 2023. Lastly, Monster, acquired CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in early 2022 and launched the Beast Unleashed, a new brand of flavored malt beverages in early 2023.\n\nDue to the increased leverage that these combined operations will have in distribution and sales and marketing expenses, the costs to the Company of competing is anticipated to be great. The potential also exists for these large competitors to increase their influence with their Distributors, making it difficult for smaller beverage companies to maintain their market presence or enter new markets. The continuing consolidation could also reduce the contract brewing capacity that is available to the Company. These potential increases in the number and availability of competing brands, the costs to compete, reductions in contract brewing capacity and decreases in distribution support and opportunities may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results.\n\n**_Changes in public attitudes and drinker tastes could harm the Company’s business. Regulatory changes in response to public attitudes could adversely affect the Company’s business._**\n\nThe alcoholic beverage industry has been the subject of considerable societal and political attention for several years, due to public concern over alcohol-related social problems, including driving under the influence, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol, including alcoholism. As an outgrowth of these concerns, the possibility exists that advertising by beer producers could be restricted, that additional cautionary labeling or packaging requirements might be imposed, that further restrictions on the sale of alcohol might be imposed or that there may be renewed efforts to impose increased excise or other taxes on beer sold in the United States.\n\nThe domestic beer industry, other than the market for High End beer occasions and Beyond Beer occasions, has experienced a decline in shipments over the last ten years. The Company believes that this decline is due to declining alcohol consumption per person in the population, drinkers trading up to drink high quality, more flavorful hard seltzers. beers and spirts RTDs, health and wellness trends and increased competition from wine and spirits companies. If consumption of the Company’s products, when introduced, in general were to come into disfavor among domestic drinkers, or if the domestic alcohol beverage industry were subjected to significant additional societal pressure or governmental regulations, the Company’s business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally, certain states are considering or have passed laws and regulations that allow the sale and distribution of marijuana. Currently it is not possible to predict the impact of this on sales of alcohol, but it is possible that legal marijuana usage could adversely impact the demand for the Company’s products.\n\n**_The Company anticipates being dependent on distributors._**\n\nIn the United States, where the Company intends for its beer to be sold, the Company anticipates selling most of its beer to independent beer Distributors for distribution to retailers and, ultimately, to drinkers. Although the Company intends to engage multiple Distributors, sustained growth will require it to maintain such relationships and possibly enter into agreements with additional Distributors. Changes in control or ownership within the distribution network could lead to less support of the Company’s products.\n\nContributing to distribution risk is the fact that the Company’s distribution agreements, when entered into, are anticipated to be generally terminable by the Distributor on relatively short notice. While these distribution agreements are anticipated to contain provisions giving the Company enforcement and termination rights, some state laws prohibit the Company from exercising these contractual rights. The Company’s ability to maintain distribution arrangements may be adversely affected by the fact that many Distributors are reliant on one of the major beer producers for a large percentage of their revenue and, therefore, they may be influenced by such producers. If the Company’s distribution agreements are terminated, it may not be able to enter into new distribution agreements on substantially similar terms, which may result in an increase in the costs of distribution.\n\nNo assurance can be given that the Company will be able to establish or maintain a distribution network or secure additional Distributors on terms favorable to the Company.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \n**RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND SAFE INDUSTRY**\n\n**_Our success depends upon our ability to introduce new products that track customer preferences._**\n\nOur success depends upon our ability to introduce new products that track consumer preferences. Our efforts to introduce new products into the market may not be successful, and new products that we introduce may not result in customer or market acceptance. We develop new products that we believe will match consumer preferences. The development of a new product is a lengthy and costly process and may not result in the development of a marketable or profitable product. Failure to develop new products that are attractive to consumers could decrease our sales, operating margins, and market share and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n**_Our advertising and promotional investments may affect the Company’s financial results but not be effective._**\n\nThe Company has made and expects to continue to make, significant advertising and promotional expenditures to enhance its brand. These expenditures may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations in a particular quarter or even for the full year, and may not result in increased sales. Variations in the levels of advertising and promotional expenditures have in the past caused, and are expected in the future to continue to cause, variability in the Company’s quarterly results of operations. While the Company attempts to invest only in effective advertising and promotional activities, it is difficult to correlate such investments with sales results, and there is no guarantee that the Company’s expenditures will be effective in building brand equity or growing long term sales.\n\n**_Our business depends on maintaining and strengthening our brand, as well as our reputation as a producer of high-quality goods, to maintain and generate ongoing demand for our products, and any harm to our brand could result in a significant reduction in such demand which could materially adversely affect our results of operations._**\n\nThe “American Rebel” name and brand image are integral to the growth of our business, as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Our success depends on the value and reputation of our brand, which, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality, design, performance, functionality and durability of our products, e-commerce sales and retail partner floor spaces, our communication activities, including advertising, social media and public relations, and our management of the customer experience, including direct interfaces through customer service. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand are important to expanding our customer base and will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide consistent, high-quality consumer experiences. To sustain long-term growth, we must continue to successfully promote our products to consumers, as well as other individuals, who value and identify with our brand.\n\nIneffective marketing, negative publicity, product diversion to unauthorized distribution channels, product or manufacturing defects, and those and other factors could rapidly and severely diminish customer confidence in us. Maintaining and enhancing our brand image are important to expanding our customer base. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand in current or new markets, or if we fail to continue to successfully market and sell our products to our existing customers or expand our customer base, our growth strategy and results of operations could be harmed.\n\nAdditionally, independent third parties and consumers often review our products as well as those of our competitors. Perceptions of our offerings in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews, which are disseminated via various media, including the Internet. If reviews of our products are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors, our brand may be adversely affected and our results of operations materially harmed.\n\n**_As a significant portion of our revenues is derived by demand for our safes and personal security products for firearms storage purposes, we depend on the availability and regulation of firearm/ammunition storage, as well as various economic, social and political factors._**\n\nOur performance is influenced by a variety of economic, social, and political factors. General economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact our operating results. Economic uncertainty, unfavorable employment levels, declines in consumer confidence, increases in consumer debt levels, increased commodity prices, and other economic factors may affect consumer spending on discretionary items and adversely affect the demand for our products. In times of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which affects demand for our products. Any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions that diminish consumer confidence or discretionary income could reduce our sales and adversely affect our operating results. Economic conditions also affect governmental political and budgetary policies. As a result, economic conditions also can have an effect on the sale of our products to law enforcement, government, and military customers.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \nPolitical and other factors also can affect our performance. Concerns about presidential, congressional, and state elections and legislature and policy shifts resulting from those elections can affect the demand for our products. As most of our revenue is generated from sales of safes, which are purchased in large numbers for firearms storage, speculation surrounding control of firearms, firearm products, and ammunition at the federal, state, and local level and heightened fears of terrorism and crime can affect consumer demand for our products. Often, such concerns result in an increase in near-term consumer demand and subsequent softening of demand when such concerns subside. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may negatively impact operating results and cash flow.\n\nFederal and state legislatures frequently consider legislation relating to the regulation of firearms, including amendment or repeal of existing legislation. Existing laws may also be affected by future judicial rulings and interpretations firearm products, ammunition, and safe gun storage. If such restrictive changes to legislation develop, we could find it difficult, expensive, or even impossible to comply with them, impeding new product development and distribution of existing products.\n\n**_Shortages of components and materials, as well as supply chain disruptions, may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our results of operations._**\n\nThe inability to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials and components, including those necessary for the production of our products could result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders. Any delay in or loss of sales or orders could adversely impact our operating results. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers. We do not have long-term supply contracts with any suppliers. As a result, we could be subject to increased costs, supply interruptions, and difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components.\n\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers for various raw materials and components for our products exposes us to volatility in the availability, quality, and price of these raw materials and components. Our orders with certain of our suppliers may represent a very small portion of their total orders. As a result, they may not give priority to our business, leading to potential delays in or cancellation of our orders. A disruption in deliveries from our third-party suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. Quality issues experienced by third party suppliers can also adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of our products and result in liability and reputational harm.\n\n**_We do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and their ability to cancel, reduce, or delay orders could reduce our revenue and increase our costs._**\n\nOur customers do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, but instead issue purchase orders for our products as needed. As a result, customers can cancel purchase orders or reduce or delay orders at any time. The cancellation, delay, or reduction of customer purchase orders could result in reduced sales, excess inventory, unabsorbed overhead, and reduced income from operations.\n\nWe often schedule internal production levels and place orders for products with third party manufacturers before receiving firm orders from our customers. Therefore, if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products to deliver to our customers. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include the following:\n\n● | an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products or for the products of our competitors;  \n---|---  \n● | our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance of new products;  \n  \n16  \n---  \n  \n● | new product introductions by us or our competitors;  \n---|---  \n● | changes in our relationships within our distribution channels;  \n● | changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers;  \n● | changes in laws and regulations governing the activities for which we sell products, such as hunting and shooting sports; and  \n● | changes in laws and regulations regarding the possession and sale of medical or recreational controlled- substances.  \n  \nInventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we underestimate demand for our products, our suppliers may not be able to react quickly enough to meet consumer demand, resulting in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenue, and damage to our reputation and customer and consumer relationships. We may not be able to manage inventory levels successfully to meet future order and reorder requirements.\n\n**_We face intense competition that could result in our losing or failing to gain market share and suffering reduced sales._**\n\nWe operate in intensely competitive markets that are characterized by price erosion and competition from major domestic and international companies. Competition in the markets in which we operate is based on a number of factors, including price, quality, performance, reliability, styling, product features, and warranties, and sales and marketing programs. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share.\n\nOur competitors include nationwide safe manufacturers and various smaller manufacturers and importers. Most of our competitors have greater market recognition, larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, to invest more funds in intellectual property and product development, to negotiate lower prices for raw materials and components, to deliver competitive products at lower prices, and to introduce new products and respond to consumer requirements more quickly than we can.\n\nOur competitors could introduce products with superior features at lower prices than our products and could also bundle existing or new products with other more established products to compete with us. Certain of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with us. Our competitors could also gain market share by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with other competitors.\n\nFinally, we may face additional sources of competition in the future because new distribution methods offered by the Internet and electronic commerce have removed many of the barriers to entry historically faced by start-up companies. Retailers also demand that suppliers reduce their prices on products, which could lead to lower margins. Any of the foregoing effects could cause our sales to decline, which would harm our financial position and results of operations.\n\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. These factors include the following:\n\n● | our success in developing, producing, marketing, and successfully selling new products;  \n---|---  \n● | our ability to efficiently manage our operations;  \n● | our ability to implement our strategies and business plans;  \n● | our ability to achieve future operating results;  \n  \n17  \n---  \n  \n● | our ability to address the needs of our consumer customers;  \n---|---  \n● | the pricing, quality, performance, and reliability of our products;  \n● | the quality of our customer service;  \n● | the efficiency of our production; and  \n● | product or technology introductions by our competitors.  \n  \nBecause we believe technological and functional distinctions among competing products in our markets are perceived by many end-user consumers to be relatively modest, effectiveness in marketing and manufacturing are particularly important competitive factors in our business.\n\n**_We have a limited operating history on which you can evaluate our company._**\n\nWe have a limited operating history on which you can evaluate our company. The corporate entity has existed since 2014 and started engaging in its current primary business operations in April 2019. As a result, our business has been subject to many of the problems, expenses, delays, and risks inherent in the establishment of a relatively new business enterprise.\n\nWe have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our business plan or performance and prospects can be made. Our business and prospects must be considered in the light of the potential problems, delays, uncertainties and complications encountered in connection with a newly established business and creating a new line of products. The risks include, in part, the possibility that we will not be able to develop functional and scalable products, or that although functional and scalable, our products and will not be economical to market; that our competitors hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing such products; that our competitors market a superior or equivalent product; that our competitors have such a significant advantage in brand recognition that our products will not be considered by potential customers; that we are not able to upgrade and enhance our technologies and products to accommodate new features as the market evolves; or the failure to receive necessary regulatory clearances for our products. To successfully introduce and market our products at a profit, we must establish brand name recognition and competitive advantages for our products. There are no assurances that we can successfully address these challenges. If it is unsuccessful, we and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe current and future expense levels are based largely on estimates of planned operations and future revenues. It is difficult to accurately forecast future revenues because our business is relatively new, and our market is rapidly developing. If our forecasts prove incorrect, the business, operating results and our financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unanticipated reduction in revenue. As a result, any significant reduction in revenues would immediately and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n**_We are highly dependent on Charles A. Ross, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of our Chief Executive Officer, whose knowledge, leadership and industry reputation upon which we rely, could harm our ability to execute our business plan._**\n\nWe are highly dependent on Charles A. Ross, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors (the “Board”). Our success depends heavily upon the continued contributions of Mr. Ross, whose leadership, industry reputation entrepreneurial background and creative marketing skills may be difficult to replace at this stage in our business development, and on our ability to attract and retain similarly positioned prominent leaders. If we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer, our ability to execute our business plan may be harmed and we may be forced to limit operations until such time as we could hire suitable replacements.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \n**_We cannot predict when we will achieve profitability._**\n\nWe have not been profitable and cannot predict when or if we will achieve profitability. We have experienced net losses since our inception in December 2014.\n\nWe cannot predict when we will achieve profitability, if ever. Our inability to become profitable may force us to curtail or temporarily discontinue our research and development programs and our day-to-day operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that profitability, if achieved, can be sustained on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $34,112,810.\n\n**_We have limited financial resources. Our independent registered auditors’ report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern_** _._\n\nWe have recorded net losses since inception and have significant accumulated deficits. We have relied upon loans and equity financings for operating capital. Total revenues will be insufficient to pay off existing debt and fund operations. We may be required to rely on further debt financing, further loans from related parties, and private placements of our common and preferred stock for our additional cash needs. Such funding sources may not be available, or the terms of such funding sources may not be acceptable to the Company.\n\n**_American Rebel has limited financial resources. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern if we are unable to raise additional funds_** _._\n\nWe expect to require additional funds to further develop our business plan, including the anticipated launch of new products, in addition to continuing to market our safes and concealed carry product line. Since it is impossible to predict with certainty the timing and amount of funds required to establish profitability, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional funds through equity or debt offerings or otherwise in order to meet our expected future liquidity requirements. Any such financing that we undertake may be dilutive to existing stockholders.\n\n**_The sales of our safes are dependent in large part on the sales of firearms._**\n\nWe market safes and other personal security products for sale to a wide variety of consumers. Although our customer base is large and diverse, and our products serve our customers’ different needs, our products have been particularly popular among collectors, hunters, sportsmen, competitive shooters, and gun enthusiasts. The sale of safe firearms storage and security components is influenced by the sale and usage of firearms. Sales of firearms are influenced by a variety of economic, social, and political factors, which may result in volatile sales.\n\n**_Our financial results may be affected by tariffs or border adjustment taxes or other import restrictions._**\n\nOur current backpack and apparel suppliers have facilities both in China and Mexico and the imposition of tariffs or border adjustment taxes may affect our financial results. The current political climate is hostile to companies manufacturing goods outside of the US. At the current manufacturing levels, it is impractical to seek manufacturing facilities in the United States as US manufacturers are unable to meet or even approach the cost of manufacturing small quantities of custom-made goods. We are in the process of locating an alternative supplier which will have the capacity to produce commercial volumes of our backpacks and apparel to meet our expected demands. However, we have not yet located a suitable supplier and, even if we are able to do so, there is no guarantee that our manufacturing process will scale to produce our products in quantities sufficient to meet demand.\n\n**_An inability to expand our e-commerce business and sales organization to effectively address existing and new markets that we intend to target could reduce our future growth and impact on our business and operating results._**\n\nConsumers are increasingly purchasing products online. We operate a direct-to-consumer e-commerce store to maintain an online presence with our end users. The future success of our online operations depends on our ability to use our marketing resources to communicate with existing and potential customers. We face competitive pressure to offer promotional discounts, which could impact our gross margin and increase our marketing expenses. We are limited, however, in our ability to fully respond to competitor price discounting because we cannot market our products at prices that may produce adverse relationships with our customers that operate brick and mortar locations as they may perceive themselves to be at a disadvantage based on lower e-commerce pricing to end consumers. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our e-commerce business to respond to shifting consumer traffic patterns and direct-to-consumer buying trends.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nIn addition, e-commerce and direct-to-consumer operations are subject to numerous risks, including implementing and maintaining appropriate technology to support business strategies; reliance on third-party computer hardware/software and service providers; data breaches; violations of state, federal or international laws, including those relating to firearms and ammunition sales; online privacy; credit card fraud; telecommunication failures; electronic break-ins and similar disruptions; and disruption of Internet service. Our inability to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties or to successfully maintain and expand our direct-to-consumer business may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results.\n\n**_We sell products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability, or personal injury claims and litigation._**\n\nOur products are used to store, in part, items that involve risk of personal injury and death. Our products expose us to potential product liability, warranty liability, and personal injury claims and litigation relating to the use or misuse of our products, including allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product or activities associated with the product, negligence, and strict liability. If successful, any such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Defects in our products may result in a loss of sales, recall expenses, delay in market acceptance, and damage to our reputation and increased warranty costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Although we maintain product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are reasonable, we may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, in the future and product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage. In addition, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products.\n\n**_Despite the Company’s indebtedness levels, we are able to incur substantially more debt. This could further increase the risks associated with its leverage._**\n\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, although certain terms of current debt agreements prohibit us from doing so. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with its substantial indebtedness describe above, including its possible inability to service its debt, will increase.\n\n**_At this stage of our business operations, even with our good faith efforts, investors in our company may lose some or all of their investment._**\n\nBecause the nature of our business is expected to change as a result of shifts in the industries in which we operate, competition, and the development of new and improved technology, management forecasts are not necessarily indicative of future operations and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Further, we have raised substantial debt and equity to fund our business operations, which to date have generated insufficient revenue to support our working capital needs.\n\nWhile management believes its estimates of projected occurrences and events are within the timetable of its business plan, our actual results may differ substantially from those that are currently anticipated. If our revenues do not increase to a level to support our working capital needs, we will be forced to seek equity capital to fund our operations and repay our substantial debt balances, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\n\n**_Product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations._**\n\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of our products involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events. The Company may not properly anticipate customer applications of our products and our products may fail to survive such unanticipated customer use. If the Company’s products fail to adequately perform to meet the customer’s expectations, the customer may demand refunds or replacements which will negatively affect the Company’s profitability.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \n**_We could be exposed to significant liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs and adequate levels or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims._**\n\nOur products support the use and access to firearms and if our products are ineffective, we could require protection against potential product liability claims.\n\n**_We will not be profitable unless we can demonstrate that our products can be manufactured at low prices._**\n\nTo date, we have manufactured our products in limited volume. As the Company creates demand for its products, our projections require the benefit of volume discounts as we increase the size of our order. We can offer no assurance that either we or our manufacturing partners will develop efficient, automated, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards or production volumes required to successfully mass market our products. Even if we or our manufacturing partners are successful in developing such manufacturing capability and processes, we do not know whether we or they will be timely in meeting our product commercialization schedule or the production and delivery requirements of potential customers. A failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n\nOur profitability in part is dependent on material and other manufacturing costs. We are unable to offer any assurance that either we or a manufacturing partner will be able to reduce costs to a level that will allow production of a competitive product or that any product produced using lower cost materials and manufacturing processes will not suffer from a reduction in performance, reliability and longevity.\n\n**_War, terrorism, other acts of violence or natural or manmade disasters such as a pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis may affect the markets in which the Company operates, the Company’s customers, the Company’s delivery of products and customer service, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition._**\n\nOur business and supply chain may be adversely affected by instability, disruption or destruction in a geographic region in which it operates, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, and natural or manmade disasters, including famine, food, fire, earthquake, storm or pandemic events and spread of disease (including the outbreak of COVID-19).\n\nSuch events may cause customers to suspend their decisions on using the Company’s products and services, make it impossible to access some of our inventory, and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles that could interfere with purchases of goods or services and commitments to develop new products and services. These events also pose significant risks to the Company’s personnel and to physical facilities, transportation and operations, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial results.\n\nAny significant disruption to communications and travel, including travel restrictions and other potential protective quarantine measures against COVID-19 or other public health crisis by governmental agencies, could make it difficult for the Company to deliver goods services to its customers. War, riots, or other disasters may increase the need for our products and demand by government and military may make it difficult for use to provide products to customers. Further, travel restrictions and protective measures against COVID-19 could cause the Company to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain the Company’s ability to retain the highly skilled personnel the Company needs for its operations. Due to the substantial uncertainty related to the effects of the pandemic, its duration and the related market impacts, including the economic stimulus activity, we are unable to predict the specific impact the pandemic and related restrictions (including the lifting or re-imposing of restrictions due to the Omicron variant or otherwise) will have on our results of operations, liquidity or long-term financial results.\n\nWe believe COVID-19 has not yet had a materially adverse effect on our operational results, but could at any time and without notice in the foreseeable future. As a result of COVID-19, at any time we may be subject to increased operating costs, supply interruptions, and difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components. COVID-19 has resulted in restrictions, postponements and cancelations of meetings, conferences, trade shows and the impact, extent and duration of the government-imposed restrictions on travel and public gatherings as well as the overall effect of the COVID-19 virus is currently unknown.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \n**_The costs of being a public company could result in us being unable to continue as a going concern._**\n\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with numerous financial reporting and legal requirements, including those pertaining to audits and internal control. The costs of maintaining public company reporting requirements could be significant and may preclude us from seeking financing or equity investment on terms acceptable to us and our stockholders. We estimate these costs to be in excess of $100,000 per year and may be higher if our business volume or business activity increases significantly. Our current estimate of costs does not include the necessary expenses associated with compliance, documentation and specific reporting requirements of Section 404 as we will not be subject to the full reporting requirements of Section 404 until we exceed $700 million in public float market capitalization.\n\nIf our revenues are insufficient or non-existent, or we cannot satisfy many of these costs through the issuance of shares or debt, we may be unable to satisfy these costs in the normal course of business. This would certainly result in our being unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n**_Any acquisitions that we potentially undertake will involve significant risks, and any acquisitions that we undertake in the future could disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and harm our operating results._**\n\nPart of our growth strategy is to expand our operations through strategic acquisitions to enhance existing products and offer new products, enter new markets and businesses, strengthen and avoid interruption from our supply chain, and enhance our position in current markets and businesses. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size, and success of any future acquisitions. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results.\n\nOur ability to complete acquisitions that we desire to make will depend upon various factors, including the following:\n\n● | the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at attractive purchase prices;  \n---|---  \n● | the ability to compete effectively for available acquisition opportunities;  \n● | the availability of cash resources, borrowing capacity, or stock at favorable price levels to provide required purchase prices in acquisitions;  \n● | the ability of management to devote sufficient attention to acquisition efforts; and  \n● | the ability to obtain any requisite governmental or other approvals.  \n  \nWe may have little or no experience with certain acquired businesses, which could involve significantly different supply chains, production techniques, customers, and competitive factors than our current business. This lack of experience would require us to rely to a great extent on the management teams of these acquired businesses. These acquisitions also could require us to make significant investments in systems, equipment, facilities, and personnel in anticipation of growth. These costs could be essential to implement our growth strategy in supporting our expanded activities and resulting corporate structure changes. We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as we expand into these new markets within the time frames we expect, if at all. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as we expand into these new markets, or do not achieve them within the time frames we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nUnforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with future acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our profitability. Any future acquisitions may not meet our strategic objectives or perform as anticipated. In addition, the size, timing, and success of any future acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. These interim fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \nIf we finance any future acquisitions in whole or in part through the issuance of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock, existing stockholders will experience dilution in the voting power of their Common Stock and earnings per share could be negatively impacted. The extent to which we will be able or willing to use our Common Stock for acquisitions will depend on the market price of our Common Stock from time-to-time and the willingness of potential acquisition candidates to accept our Common Stock as full or partial consideration for the sale of their businesses. Our inability to use our Common Stock as consideration, to generate cash from operations, or to obtain additional funding through debt or equity financings to pursue an acquisition could limit our growth.\n\n**_We may not be able to successfully fund future acquisitions of new businesses due to the lack of availability of debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, which could impede the implementation of our acquisition strategy and materially adversely impact our financial condition, business and results of operations._**\n\nIn order to make future acquisitions, we intend to raise capital primarily through debt financing, additional equity offerings, the sale of stock or assets of our businesses, and by offering equity in the businesses to the sellers of target businesses or by undertaking a combination of any of the above. Since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be readily predicted, we may need to be able to obtain funding on short notice to benefit fully from attractive acquisition opportunities. Such funding may not be available on acceptable terms. In addition, the level of our indebtedness may impact our ability to borrow funds on acceptable terms. Another source of capital for us may be the sale of additional shares of Common Stock, subject to market conditions and investor demand for the shares at prices that we consider to be in the interests of our stockholders. These risks may materially adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition strategy successfully and materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\n\n**_The industry in which we operate is competitive, price sensitive and subject to risks of governmental regulations or laws. If our competitors are better able to develop and market products that are more effective, less costly, easier to use, or are otherwise more attractive, we may be unable to compete effectively with other companies._**\n\nThe safe and personal security industry is characterized by intense competition. We will face competition on the basis of product features, reliability, price, apparent value, and other factors. Competitors may include large safe makers and other companies, some of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do, and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets. Our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging styles, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources than ours or may be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.\n\n**_Our industry could experience greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future._**\n\nThe rapidly growing interest in new concealed carry products that this rapidly growing market may attract the attention of government regulators and legislators. The current trend in legislation is to roll back or minimize access to firearms restrictions, but there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.\n\n**RISKS RELATED TO OUR LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT**\n\n**_Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results._**\n\nOur policies and procedures are reasonably designed to comply with applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the Commission, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, safety, environmental, labeling and gun safety related laws, such as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act as well as state laws. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n**_Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited._**\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, for federal and state income tax purposes of $34,112,810 and $26,969,657, respectively, which begins to expire in 2034. Net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net operating losses generated before 2018 will begin to expire in 2032. The federal net operating losses generated in and after 2018 may be carried forward indefinitely. The expiration of state NOL carryforwards vary by state and begin to expire in 2024. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use NOLs before their expiration, or at all. Under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5 percent stockholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership changes that may occur in the future (which may be outside our control).\n\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, as amended by the CARES Act, NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, are subject to an 80% of taxable income limitation (as calculated before taking the NOLs into account) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, NOLs arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are subject to a five-year carryback and indefinite carryforward, while NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020, also are subject to indefinite carryforward but cannot be carried back. Our NOLs may also be subject to limitations in other jurisdictions. For example, California recently enacted legislation suspending the use of NOLs for taxable years 2020, 2021, and 2022 for many taxpayers. In future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset is recognized related to our NOLs, the changes in the carryforward/carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our valuation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2017.\n\n**_If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may lose a competitive advantage or incur substantial litigation costs to protect our rights._**\n\nOur future success depends upon our proprietary technology. Our protective measures, including patent, trademark and trade secret protection, may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights. The right to stop others from misusing our trademarks, service marks, and patents in commerce depends to some extent on our ability to show evidence of enforcement of our rights against such misuse in commerce. Our efforts to stop improper use, if insufficient, may lead to loss of trademark and service mark rights, brand loyalty, and notoriety among our customers and prospective customers. The scope of any patent that we have or may obtain may not prevent others from developing and selling competing products. The validity and breadth of claims covered in technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions, and the resolution of such claims may be highly uncertain, and expensive. In addition, our patents may be held invalid upon challenge, or others may claim rights in or ownership of our patents. Company owned trademarks are listed under the heading Intellectual Property on page 20.\n\n**_We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of Section 15(d) and 12(g) of the Exchange Act that require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit._**\n\nWe are required to file periodic reports with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm will have to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel will have to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in, and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will affect the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \nHowever, for as long as we remain a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, reduced financial statement disclosure in registration statements, which must include two years of audited financial statements, reduced financial statement disclosure in annual reports on Form 10-K, and exemptions from the auditor attestation of management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer a smaller reporting company.\n\nIf we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our Common Stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly.\n\n**_Our internal controls may be inadequate, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public._**\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. As defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n● | pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;  \n---|---  \n● | provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and/or directors of the Company; and  \n● | provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  \n  \nOur internal controls may be inadequate or ineffective, which could cause financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public. Furthermore, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they may require our management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision.\n\nFailure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to face regulatory action and also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\n\nHowever, our auditors will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer a smaller reporting company.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n**RISKS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING AND OWNERSHIP OF THE SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK**\n\n**_Although we plan to list the_**** _Series C Preferred Stock being offered on Nasdaq following the Offering, there is no assurance that we will be successful with the listing or there will ever be a public market for the Series C Preferred Stock at any time_.**\n\nAlthough our Common Stock and certain warrants currently trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there is no public trading market for our Series C Preferred Stock at this time. Although we plan to list the Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq upon completion of this offering, we may not be successful with such listing, and we cannot assure you that any market for our Series C Preferred Stock will ever develop. Further, we are currently not in compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, because our Common Stock is trading below $1.00 per share. This non-compliance may impact our ability to list the shares of Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq. The shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not readily marketable, and their value may be subject to adverse conditions that are impossible to predict. There can be no assurance that if it becomes necessary to sell or transfer our Series C Preferred Stock, a buyer could be found, or a suitable purchase price could be obtained. With no public trading market, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for you to resell your Series C Preferred Stock if you should desire to do so. In addition, there can be no assurance that, in the event you are able to find a purchaser for your Series C Preferred Stock, that you will be able to resell such securities at the price you paid in this offering. Therefore, prospective investors who require liquidity in their investment should not rely upon the Series C Preferred Stock being offered under this offering as a short-term component of their return on investment.\n\n**_This is a fixed price offering and the fixed offering price may not accurately represent the current value of us or our assets at any particular time. Therefore, the purchase price you pay for our shares may not be supported by the value of our assets at the time of your purchase._**\n\nThis is a fixed price offering, which means that the offering price for our shares is fixed and will not vary based on the underlying value of our assets at any time. Our Board has determined the offering price in its sole discretion. The fixed offering price for our shares has not been based on appraisals of any assets we own or may own, or of our company as a whole, nor do we intend to obtain such appraisals. Therefore, the fixed offering price established for our shares may not be supported by the current value of our company or our assets at any particular time.\n\n**_Management has broad discretion in using the proceeds from this Offering_.**\n\nWe plan to use the proceeds from this offering to fund acquisitions, for general working capital and for debt repayment. We have broad discretion in the application of proceeds and the timing of the expenditure of the proceeds of this Offering. If we fail to apply the proceeds effectively, we may not be successful in implementing our business plan. You will not have the opportunity to evaluate all of the economic, financial or other information upon which we base our decisions.\n\n**_You will not have a vote or influence on the management of our company._**\n\nAll decisions with respect to the management of our company will be made exclusively by the officers, directors or employees of our company. You, as an investor in our Series C Preferred Stock, have very limited voting rights and will have no ability to vote on issues of company management and will not have the right or power to take part in the management of our company and will not be represented on the Board of our company. Accordingly, no person should purchase our Series C Preferred Stock unless he or she is willing to entrust all aspects of management to our company.\n\n**_We may amend our business policies without stockholder approval_.**\n\nOur Board determines our growth, investment, financing, capitalization, borrowing, operations and distributions policies. Although our Board has no intention at present to change or reverse any of these policies, they may be amended or revised without notice to holders of our Series C Preferred Stock. Accordingly, holders of our series C Preferred stock will not have any control over changes in our policies. We cannot assure you that changes in our policies will serve fully the interests of all holders of our Series C Preferred Stock.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**_Our Board has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to the Series C Preferred Stock and with the ability to affect adversely stockholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us._**\n\nOur Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation allow us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders. Our Board has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our Board could authorize the issuance of additional series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of other securities and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our other securities, including the Series C Preferred Stock.\n\n**_We cannot assure you that we will be able to pay cash dividends._**\n\nOur ability to pay cash dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock is dependent on our ability to operate profitably and to generate cash from our operations and the operations of our operating businesses. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay cash dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock and may only be able to issue dividends in shares of our Common Stock.\n\n**_We cannot assure you that we will be able to redeem our Series C Preferred Stock._**\n\nOur ability to redeem on our Series C Preferred Stock is dependent on our ability to operate profitably and to generate cash from our operations and the operations of our operating businesses or from raising additional capital. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to redeem our Series C Preferred Stock and may only be able to offer investors the ability to convert shares of Series C Preferred Stock into shares of our Common Stock.\n\n**_We may issue additional debt and equity securities, which are senior to our Series C Preferred Stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could materially adversely affect the value of the Series C Preferred Stock._**\n\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into additional debt or debt-like financing that is secured by all or up to all of our assets, or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes or shares. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to our stockholders. Any preferred securities, if issued by our company, may have a preference with respect to distributions and upon liquidation that is senior to the preference of the Series C Preferred Stock, which could further limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financing.\n\nFurther, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. Thus, you will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the value of your Series C Preferred Stock. In addition, we can change our leverage strategy from time to time without approval of holders of our Preferred Stock or Common Stock, which could materially adversely affect the value of our Preferred Stock, including the Series C Preferred Stock.\n\n**_Our executive officers and directors, and their affiliated entities, although they own an insignificant percentage of our Common Stock, however super voting preferred stock allows them to be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval._**\n\nOur executive officers and directors own only approximately 1% of our Common Stock. However, we have issued 125,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to three members of our management, Messrs. Charles A. Ross, Jr., Corey Lambrecht and Doug E. Grau, which have superior voting rights of 1,000 to 1 over shares of our Common Stock, resulting in nearly 96% of the current available stockholder votes. In addition, these shares are able to be converted into shares of Common Stock at a rate of 1 share of Series A Preferred Stock into 500 shares of Common Stock over a three to five-year period under certain circumstances.\n\nAccordingly, these stockholders who are members of management may, as a practical matter, continue to be able to control the election of a majority of our directors and the determination of all corporate actions after these offerings and any future offerings. This concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n**_Certain provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation may make it more difficult for a third party to effect a change-of-control._**\n\nOur second amended and restated articles of incorporation authorizes our Board to issue up to a certain number of shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our Board without further action by the stockholders. These terms may include voting rights including the right to vote as a series on particular matters, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of existing shares, and therefore could reduce the value of such shares. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of our Board to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it costlier to acquire or effect a change-in-control, which in turn could prevent our stockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the value of our securities.\n\n**_The Subscription Agreement that investors will execute in connection with the offering includes an exclusive forum selection provision that may limit an investor’s ability to bring a claim against us._**\n\nThe subscription agreement that investors will execute to purchase shares of Series C Preferred Stock requires any claims against us based on the subscription agreement to be brought in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Nevada. By purchasing shares of Series C Preferred Stock, investors consent to the jurisdiction of the state courts located within the State of Nevada. Investors located outside the State of Nevada may have difficulty bringing any legal claim against us due to geographic limitations and may find it difficult and costly to respond to claims. This choice of forum provision may limit a holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, a court could find this provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, which may require us to incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\nTHIS EXCLUSIVE FORUM PROVISION WOULD NOT APPLY TO SUITS BROUGHT TO ENFORCE A DUTY OR LIABILITY CREATED BY FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS OR ANY OTHER CLAIM FOR WHICH THE U.S. FEDERAL COURTS HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION.\n\n**_Provisions of the Existing Warrants could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party_** _._\n\nIn addition to the discussion of the provisions of our governing organizational documents, certain provisions of our Existing Warrants could make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. The Existing Warrants prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions constituting “fundamental transactions” unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Existing Warrants. These and other provisions of the Existing Warrants could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to our stockholders.\n\n**_We may not raise sufficient funds to implement our business plan._**\n\nIn our Use of Proceeds discussion below, we present a table showing our expected uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the securities offered for sale in this offering by us. If we fail to sell at least 25% of the Series C Preferred Stock we are offering, we may not be able to implement a material portion of our planned use of proceeds. This could have a deleterious effect on your investment in us.\n\n**_We are not required to raise any minimum amount in this offering before we may utilize the funds received in this offering. Investors should be aware that there is no assurance that any monies beside their own will be invested in this Offering._**\n\nBecause there is no minimum amount of subscriptions which we must receive before accepting funds in the Offering, you will not be assured that we will have sufficient funds to execute our business plan or satisfy its working capital requirements and will bear the risk that we will be unable to secure the funds necessary to meet our current and anticipated financial obligations.\n\n**_This offering is being conducted on a “best efforts” basis without a minimum and we may not be able to execute our growth strategy if the $_ 19,999,995 _maximum is not sold._**\n\nIf you invest in our Series C Preferred Stock and less than all of the offered shares of our Series C Preferred Stock are sold, the risk of losing your entire investment will be increased. We are offering our Series C Preferred Stock on a “best efforts” basis without a minimum, and we can give no assurance that all of the offered Series C Preferred Stock will be sold. If less than $19,999,995 of Series C Preferred Stock shares offered are sold, we may be unable to fund all the intended uses described in this offering circular from the net proceeds anticipated from this offering without obtaining funds from alternative sources or using working capital that we generate. Alternative sources of funding may not be available to us at what we consider to be a reasonable cost, and the working capital generated by us may not be sufficient to fund any uses not financed by offering net proceeds. No assurance can be given to you that any funds will be invested in this offering other than your own.\n\n**_We may terminate this Offering at any time during the Offering period._**\n\nWe reserve the right to terminate this Offering at any time, regardless of the number of shares sold. In the event that we terminate this Offering at any time prior to the sale of all of the shares offered hereby, whatever amount of capital that we have raised at that time will have already been utilized by our company and no funds will be returned to subscribers.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \n**USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nWe estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $17,795,995 if the maximum number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock being offered are sold after deducting the estimated Selling Agent commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\n\nThe following table below sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the securities offered for sale in this offering by us.

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering as described above, we may invest the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing investment grade instruments.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \nThe expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve and change. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures, specifically with respect to working capital, may vary significantly depending on numerous factors. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.\n\nThe above description of the anticipated use of proceeds is not binding on us and is merely a description of our current intentions. We reserve the right to change the above use of proceeds if management believes it is in the best interests of our company.\n\n**DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE**\n\nThere will be no trading market for our Series C Preferred Stock upon issuance and we do not expect any trading market to develop for the Series C Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock is being sold at par, which we have determined to be $7.50 per share, and it is expected that at some time after the initial closing of this offering we will exercise our right to call the Series C Preferred Stock for redemption at a call price equal to 150% of par (i.e., of the original issue price of the Series C Preferred Stock) or that, after the fifth anniversary of the initial closing of this offering, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock will exercise their right to put their shares of Series C Preferred Stock to us at 150% of par. Accordingly, the $7.50 price per share of Series C Preferred Stock is arbitrary and represents the amount of investment made by an investor for purposes of determining the redemption price upon a put or call (i.e., the redemption price will be 150% of the purchase price or $11.25 per share of Series C Preferred Stock).\n\n**DIVIDEND POLICY**\n\nDividends on the Series C Preferred Stock being offered will be cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears to all holders of record on the applicable record date. Holders of our Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive cumulative dividends in the amount of $0.16 per share each quarter, which is equivalent to the annual rate of 8.53% of the $7.50 original per share purchase price; provided that upon an event of default (generally defined as our failure to pay dividends when due or to redeem shares when requested by a holder), such amount shall be increased to $0.225 per quarter, which is equivalent to the annual rate of 12% of the $7.50 original per share purchase price. Dividends on shares of our Series C Preferred Stock will continue to accrue even if any of our agreements prohibit the current payment of dividends or we do not have earnings. Dividends may be paid in cash or in kind in the form of Common Stock of the Company equal to the closing price of Common Stock on the last day of the quarter at the Company’s discretion.\n\nOur anticipated source of funds to pay the cumulative dividends for our Series C Preferred Stock in cash will be from net operating income and retained earnings. We believe that our net operating income will increase as we deploy the funds raised in this offering in a manner consistent with the use of proceeds described in this offering circular. We expect that our retained earnings will increase as we increase net operating income.\n\nSee also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of Our Series C Preferred Stock—We cannot assure you that we will be able to pay cash dividends.”\n\nWe have never declared dividends or paid cash dividends on our Common Stock. Our Board will make any future decisions regarding dividends. We currently intend to retain and use any future earnings for the development and expansion of our business and, other than as indicted above with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the near future. Our Board has complete discretion on whether to pay cash dividends or issue additional shares of Common Stock as dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock. Even if our Board decides to pay additional dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board may deem relevant.\n\n30  \n---  \n  \n**MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS**\n\n_Market for our Common Stock_\n\nOur Common Stock and certain existing warrants are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “AREB” and “AREBW,” respectively. On March 12, 2024, the closing price of our Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $0.2857 per share. On October 23, 2023, we were notified by Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the price of our Common Stock had traded at less than $1.00 per share for the last thirty consecutive trading days. Nasdaq’s notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Common Stock on Nasdaq and, at this time. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have been provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until April 22, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Common Stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days prior to April 22, 2024. Management continues to believe that adherence to its current operating and business plan will enable us to regain compliance.\n\n_Stockholders of Record_\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, an aggregate of 5,947,643 shares of our Common Stock were issued and outstanding and owned by 128 stockholders of record.\n\n_Dividends_\n\nWe have not since December 15, 2014 (date of inception) declared or paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock and currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development and expansion of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, tax laws and other factors as the board, in its discretion, deems relevant.\n\n_Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans_\n\nOn January 1, 2021, our Board approved the establishment of the 2021 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The LTIP is intended to enable us to continue to attract able directors, employees, and consultants and to provide a means whereby those individuals upon whom the responsibilities rest for successful administration and management of the Company, and whose present and potential contributions are of importance, can acquire and maintain Common Stock ownership, thereby strengthening their concern for our welfare. The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock (including shares underlying options) that may be issued under the LTIP pursuant to awards of Restricted Shares or Options will be limited to 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, which calculation shall be made on the first trading day of each new fiscal year. For fiscal year 2022, up to 6,390 shares of Common Stock were available for participants under the LTIP. For fiscal year 2023, up to 67,723 shares of Common Stock were available for participants under the LTIP. For fiscal year 2024, up to 587,992 shares of Common Stock are available for participants under the LTIP. The number of shares of Common Stock that are the subject of awards under the LTIP which are forfeited or terminated, are settled in cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock or in a manner such that all or some of the shares covered by an award are not issued to a participant or are exchanged for awards that do not involve shares will again immediately become available to be issued pursuant to awards granted under the LTIP. If shares of Common Stock are withheld from payment of an award to satisfy tax obligations with respect to the award, those shares of Common Stock will be treated as shares that have been issued under the LTIP and will not again be available for issuance under the LTIP. In December of 2022, we authorized the grant and issuance of all 6,390 shares of Common Stock under the LTIP to our executive management team. Further, in December of 2023, we authorized the grant and issuance of all 67,723 shares of Common Stock under the LTIP to our executive management team.\n\n_Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities_\n\nNone\n\n**Subsequent Issuances after Year-End**\n\nOn June 27, 2023, we entered into a PIPE transaction with Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. for the purchase and sale of $2,993,850.63 of securities, consisting of (i) 71,499 shares of Common Stock at $4.37 per share, (ii) prefunded warrants (the “2023 Prefunded Warrants”) that are exercisable into 615,000 shares of Common Stock (the “2023 Prefunded Warrant Shares”) at $4.37 per Prefunded Warrant, and (iii) immediately exercisable warrants to purchase up to 686,499 shares of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $4.24 per share and will expire five years from the date of issuance.\n\n31  \n---  \n  \nIn connection with the Company’s June 27, 2023 1-for-25 reverse split and the round lot rounding associated therewith, approximately 2.1 million new shares of Common Stock were issued.\n\nOn July 1, 2023, we authorized the issuance of 24,129 shares of Common Stock to our independent board members.\n\nOn September 8, 2023, holders of certain existing warrants exercised such warrants by paying $3,287,555.70 for 2,988,687 shares of the Company’s common stock at a reduced exercise price of $1.10 per share in consideration for the Company’s agreement to issue two new common stock purchase warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, up to 5,977,374 shares of the Company’s common stock.\n\nAll of the above-described issuances were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation D of the Securities Act as transactions not involving a public offering. With respect to each transaction listed above, no general solicitation was made by either the Company or any person acting on its behalf. All such securities issued pursuant to such exemptions are restricted securities as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) promulgated under the Securities Act, appropriate legends have been placed on the documents evidencing the securities, and may not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to an exemption there from.\n\n_Repurchase of Equity Securities_\n\nWe have no plans, programs or other arrangements in regards to repurchases of our Common Stock. Further, we did not repurchase any of our equity securities during the year ended December 31, 2022 or the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n_The following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our plans and financial condition_. _The following selected financial information is derived from our historical financial statements should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and notes thereto set forth elsewhere herein and the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” explanation included herein._\n\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in this offering circular. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Except as otherwise disclosed, all dollar figures included therein and in the following management discussion and analysis are quoted in United States dollars.\n\nThe following discussion of the Company’s financial condition and the results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes thereto appearing elsewhere in this offering circular.\n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the Company notes that in addition to the description of historical facts contained herein, this offering circular contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as detailed herein and from time to time in the Company’s other filings with the Commission and elsewhere. Such statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those, described in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others: (a) the Company’s fluctuations in sales and operating results; (b) risks associated with international operations; (c) regulatory, competitive and contractual risks; (d) development risks; (e) the ability to achieve strategic initiatives, including but not limited to the ability to achieve sales growth across the business segments through a combination of enhanced sales force, new products, and customer service; and (f) pending litigation.\n\n_Operations_\n\nOn June 9, 2016, a change in control occurred, a sixty percent (60%) ownership interest was obtained by American Rebel, Inc. from our former officer and director and founder. On June 17, 2017, the Company acquired the business of its control stockholder accounted for and presented financially as a reverse merger transaction. Our majority stockholder, American Rebel, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and we distributed shares to the stockholders of American Rebel, Inc. As a result of this reverse merger, the reported operating history of the Company is now the operating history of American Rebel, Inc. Financial statements of both companies are now consolidated and all material intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. On July 29, 2022, the Company closed on its acquisition of the Champion Entities.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \n**_Company Overview_**\n\nAmerican Rebel is boldly positioning itself as America’s Patriotic Brand. The Company has identified the market opportunity to design, manufacture, and market innovative concealed carry products and safes as well as market American Rebel Beer. American Rebel accesses its market uniquely through its positioning as America’s Patriotic Brand and the appeal of its products as well as through the profile and public persona of its founder and Chief Executive Officer, Andy Ross. Andy hosted his own television show for 12 years, has made multiple appearances over the years at trade shows, and is well-known in the archery world as the founder of Ross Archery, which was the world’s fastest-growing bow company in 2007 and 2008. Andy has also released 3 CDs, done numerous radio and print interviews, and performed many concerts in front of thousands of people. Andy has the ability to present American Rebel to large numbers of potential customers through the appeal of his music and other supporting appearances. For example, his appearance on the History Channel hit show _Counting Cars_ in February 2014 has been viewed by more than 2 million people. Bringing innovative products that satisfy an existing demand to the market through exciting means is the American Rebel blueprint for success.\n\n_Other_\n\nAs a corporate policy, we will not incur any cash obligations that we cannot satisfy with known resources, of which there are currently none except as described in “Liquidity” below or elsewhere in this offering circular. We believe that the perception that many people have of a public company makes it more likely that they will accept restricted securities from a public company as consideration for indebtedness to them than they would from a private company. We have not performed any studies of this matter. Our conclusion is based on our own observations. Additionally, the issuance of restricted shares will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of our stockholders.\n\n**_Recent Developments_**\n\n_American Rebel Beer_\n\nOn August 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Brewing Agreement with Associated Brewing. Under the terms of the Brewing Agreement, Associated Brewing has been appointed as the exclusive producer and seller of American Rebel branded spirits, with the initial product being American Rebel Light Beer. American Rebel Light Beer will launch regionally in early 2024. The Company has paid a setup fee and security deposit to Associated Brewing.\n\n_Acquisition of Champion Entities_\n\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company entered into a stock and membership interest purchase agreement with the Champion Entities and Seller pursuant to the Champion Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and membership interests of the Champion Entities from the Seller. This transaction was completed on July 29, 2022. We have included the Champion Entities assets and liabilities as of that date and the subsequent financial activity through the date of this offering circular in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For all intent and purposes, the Champion Entities have been integrated with our existing operations and are under the control of our management team.\n\nThe closing of the acquisition occurred on July 29, 2022. Under the terms of the Champion Purchase Agreement, the Company paid the Seller (i) cash consideration in the amount of $9,150,000, along with (ii) cash deposits in the amount of $350,000, and (iii) reimbursed Seller for $397,420 of agreed upon acquisitions and equipment purchases completed by the Seller and the Champion Entities since June 30, 2021.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \n_Secured Loans_\n\nOn April 14, 2023, the Company entered into a $1,000,000 Business Loan and Security Agreement (the “Secured Loan”) with an accredited investor lending source (the “Lender”). Under the Secured Loan, the Company received $980,000 on April 20, 2023, which was net of fees to the Lender. The Secured Loan requires 64 weekly payments of $20,000, for a total repayment of $1,280,000 to the Lender. The principal balance bears interest at 22.8%. The Secured Loan is secured by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries second only to a previously secured line of credit and contains other customary terms and conditions for agreements of its type. Further, the Company’s CEO, Charles A. Ross, Jr., provided a personal guaranty for the Secured Loan.\n\nOn December 28, 2023, the Company entered into a $500,000 Business Loan and Security Agreement (the “Second Secured Loan”) with Alt Banq Inc., an accredited investor lending source (“Alt Banq”). Under the Second Secured Loan, the Company received $490,000 on December 29, 2023, which was net of fees to Alt Banq.

The Second Secured Loan, is secured by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries second only to a previously secured line of credit and contains other customary terms and conditions for agreements of its type. Further, the Company’s CEO, Charles A. Ross, Jr., provided a personal guaranty for the Second Secured Loan.\n\n_Unsecured Loan_\n\nThe Company refinanced a $600,000 note with an accredited investor that was due March 31, 2023 with a new note dated July 1, 2023. The total amount refinanced with an accredited investor is $450,000, with $150,000 due December 31, 2023, and $300,000 due June 30, 2024. Interest will be paid quarterly in the amount of 12% on the outstanding principal amounts.\n\n_Armistice PIPE and Warrant Exercise_\n\nOn June 27, 2023, we entered into a PIPE transaction with Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. for the purchase and sale of $2,993,850.63 of securities, consisting of (i) 71,499 shares of Common Stock at $4.37 per share, (ii) prefunded warrants (the “2023 Prefunded Warrants”) that are exercisable into 615,000 shares of Common Stock (the “ 2023 Prefunded Warrant Shares”) at $4.37 per Prefunded Warrant, and (iii) immediately exercisable warrants to purchase up to 686,499 shares of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $4.24 per share and will expire five years from the date of issuance.\n\nOn September 8, 2023, Armistice exercised certain existing warrants by paying $3,287,555.70 for 2,988,687 shares of the Company’s common stock at a reduced exercise price of $1.10 per share in consideration for the Company’s agreement to issue two new common stock purchase warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, up to 5,977,374 shares of the Company’s common stock.\n\n**__Results of Operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021__**\n\n_Revenue and cost of goods sold_\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we reported Sales of $8,449,800, compared to Sales of $986,826 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to the Company’s recent acquisition of the Champion Entities that closed on July 29, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we reported Cost of Sales of $6,509,382, compared to Cost of Sales of $812,130 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in Cost of Sales was again primarily attributable to the acquisition of the Champion Entities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we reported Gross Profit of $1,940,418, compared to Gross Profit of $174,696 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in Gross Profit was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the Champion Entities. Please review our footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for its presentation on the pro forma financial information as if the Company and the Champion Entities had been combined since January 1, 2021. This represents a significant difference if we were able to include a full year of revenue and costs of sales for the Champion Entities for 2022.\n\n_Expenses_\n\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $7,003,704 compared to $3,486,135 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as further described below.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred consulting and business development expenses of $2,000,624, compared to consulting and business development expenses of $2,012,803 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The slight decrease in consulting and business development expenses is due to the decrease in outside corporate consultants offset by additional payroll expenses for the Company as a result of the acquisition of the Champion Entities.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred rental expense, warehousing and outlet expense of $508,527, compared to rental expense, warehousing and outlet expense of $0 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Since the acquisition of the Champion Entities that closed on July 29, 2022, the Company now has a much larger physical footprint. Our rental expense, warehousing, etc. was negligible in years prior to 2022 and was included in our general and administrative expense line item.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred product development expenses of $746,871, compared to product development expenses of $330,353 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the amount of product development expenses was due to the increase in product development activity.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred marketing and brand development expenses of $507,503, compared to marketing and brand development expenses of $171,030 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in marketing and brand development expenses relates primarily to the expanded size of the Company and the return of trade shows post the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $3,190,092, compared to general and administrative expenses of $968,306 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase relates primarily to an increase in professional, consulting and operating fees due to the expanded size of the Company.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred depreciation expense of $50,087, compared to depreciation expense of $3,643 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in depreciation expense is due to the increased size of the Company and the assets acquired in the Champion Entities purchase.\n\n_Other income and expenses_\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred interest expense of $358,689, compared to interest expense of $2,061,782 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in interest expense is due to the Company retiring or converting to Common Stock most of its outstanding debt in late 2021. Retirement or converting to Common Stock of debt in 2022 was smaller in comparison. Additionally, the Company incurred interest expense of $350,000 for the release of pre-emptive rights from a certain lender to the Company.\n\n_Net Loss_\n\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, amounted to $7,143,153, resulting in a loss per share of $24, compared to a net loss of $6,098,944 for the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in a loss per share of $121.25. The increase in the net loss from the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to acquisition costs of the Champion Entities and our increased expenditures on financing and other activities for growth.\n\n**_Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2022_**\n\nFrom inception through September 30, 2023, we have generated an operating deficit of $37,723,739. We expect to incur additional losses during fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, and beyond, principally as a result of our increased investment in inventory, manufacturing capacity, marketing and sales expenses, and other growth initiatives.\n\n**_Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022_**\n\n_Revenue (‘Sales’) and cost of goods sold (‘Cost of Sales’)_\n\nNine months ended September 30, 2023 | Nine months ended September 30, 2022  \n---|---  \nRevenue | $| 11,418,222 | $| 4,595,547  \nCost of goods sold | 8,869,432 | 3,462,454  \nGross margin | 2,548,790 | 1,133,093  \nExpenses:  \nConsulting/payroll and other costs | 2,915,377 | 1,937,349  \nRental expense, warehousing, outlet expense | 732,360 | 314,314  \nProduct development costs | 36,821 | 146,463  \nMarketing and brand development costs | 942,687 | 349,341  \nAdministrative and other | 2,542,181 | 2,687,728  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | 79,260 | 11,311  \n7,248,686 | 5,446,506  \nOperating income (loss) | (4,699,896| ) | (959,076| )  \nOther Income (Expense)  \nInterest expense, net | (250,877| ) | (341,990| )  \nInterest expense – pre-emptive rights release | - | (350,000| )  \nInterest Income | 3,203 | 4,428  \nEmployee retention credit funds, net of costs to collect | 1,107,672 | -  \nGain/(loss) on sale of equipment | 1,400 | -  \nGain/(loss) on extinguishment of debt | 227,569 | (1,376,756| )  \n1,088,967 | (2,064,318| )  \nNet income (loss) before income tax provision | (3,610,929| ) | (6,377,731| )  \nProvision for income tax | - | -  \nNet income (loss) | $| (3,610,929| ) | $| (6,377,731| )  \n  \n35  \n---  \n  \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reported Revenues of $11,418,222 compared to Revenues of $4,595,547 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in Revenues of $6,822,675 (or 148% period over period (PoP)) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, is primarily attributable to the closing of the Champion acquisition on July 29, 2022 and a general increase from Champion’s average quarterly sales of product. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reported Cost of Goods Sold of $8,869,432, compared to Cost of Goods Sold of $3,462,454 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in Cost of Goods Sold of $5,406,978 (or 156% period over period (PoP)) for the current period is due to a significantly greater number of sales of product during the period compared to the nine months ending September 30, 2022 and again attributable to the closing of the Champion acquisition on July 29, 2022. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reported Gross Margin of $2,548,790, compared to Gross Margin of $1,133,093 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in Gross Margin of $1,415,697 (or 125% period over period (PoP)) for the nine months ending September 30, 2023, compared to the nine months ending September 30, 2022 is again due to the closing of the Champion acquisition on July 29, 2022. Gross Margin percentages for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 22.3% compared to 24.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. We expect our Gross Margin percentages to remain consistent in the mid-20% range until we achieve sufficient sales volume to increase our margins from better pricing power, to better buying power on our costs of goods, inventory and inventory management.\n\n_Operating Expenses_\n\nTotal operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $7,248,686 compared to $5,446,506 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as further described below. Overall, we saw a $1,802,180 increase in operating expenses or a 33% period over period (PoP) increase in operating expenses from the prior year comparable period. With the acquisition and integration of the Champion acquisition we expect this to be about the same going forward dropping as a percentage of Revenues as we increase our overall sales volume.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred consulting/payroll and other costs of $2,915,377 compared to consulting/payroll and other costs of $1,937,349 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in consulting/payroll and other costs of $978,028 (or 50% period over period (PoP)) was due to the increase in the number of employees and the size of the Company post-acquisition of the Champion Entities as well as increased payroll costs from a competitive jobs market. The Company expects to maintain its current consulting/payroll and other costs as we further expand our sales volume.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred rental expense, warehousing, outlet expense of $732,360, compared to rental expense, warehousing, outlet expense of $314,314 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in rental expense, warehousing, outlet expense of $418,046 is due to the significant number of leases and properties that the Company rents to conduct the Champion business. Prior to the Champion business acquisition, the Company included lease expense in the Administrative and other account. The significant number of leases and properties that the Company rents to conduct its Champion business provides a better presentation of expenses through a separate line item in its Statement of Operations. The Company expects to maintain this level of expense on a go-forward basis with its leases and rented properties. The Company may look to consolidate some of its space as it fine tunes the Champion business.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred product development expenses of $36,821, compared to product development expenses of $146,463 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in product development expenses of $109,642 (or -75% period over period (PoP)) is due to some of the Company’s current product development expenses being included in consulting/payroll and other costs account which provides for a better presentation of those expenses than pure product development expense, offset by new efforts over these past few months where we’ve incurred some significant expenses that are attributable to our private label brewery efforts and should be separated and identified. The Company expects to maintain some level of expense on a go-forward basis with new products and efforts being expended for future sales growth and product needs.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred marketing and brand development expenses of $942,687, compared to marketing and brand development expenses of $349,341 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in marketing and brand development expenses of $593,346 (or 170% period over period (PoP)) relates primarily to an increase of activities including major trade shows and the availability of working capital for these types of expenses as well as increased costs attributable to our acquisition and integration of the Champion business.\n\n36  \n---  \n  \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred administrative and other expense of $2,542,181, compared to administrative and other expense of $2,687,728 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in administrative and other expense of $145,547 (or -5% period over period (PoP)) relates primarily to the significant legal and other professional fees that we incurred during 2022 in anticipation of our registered public offerings, offset by additional expenses picked up from our acquisition of Champion and other recent financing efforts. The Company believes as it grows its sales base it will need to increase its administrative and other expenses commensurate with an overall increased profit for the future.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred depreciation and amortization expense of $79,260, compared to depreciation and amortization expense of $11,311 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to the acquisition of Champion and its significant and additional depreciable asset base that it provided to the Company’s financial position.\n\n_Other income and expenses_\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred interest expense of $250,877, compared to interest expense of $341,990 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in interest expense of $91,113 is due to a significant number of notes being paid during 2022 that were able to be paid in full from the various financings, offset by the increased borrowing costs that we have on our working capital notes payable and line of credit. We are currently paying an interest rate of approximately 7% on our line of credit, 12% on our existing working capital notes payable, and our new working capital notes payable we are paying approximately 40% per annum on this debt instrument. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred a gain on extinguishment of debt of $227,569, compared to $1,376,756 during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt is due to the charges necessary through the amortization of the debt discount recorded for the issuance of shares of common stock in connection with working capital loans retired during 2022. The Company expects to manage and maintain its interest expense exposure despite the increase in interest rates for this year over last year, as well keeping our debt obligations to a minimum as we grow the business and its sales volume. The gain on extinguishment of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is directly attributable to equity issuances that were static or an agreed upon number of shares for the services at the time (which was much higher) and the settlement of the shares as payment for the services at a time when the shares were significantly less valuable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we received approximately $1,286,000 in tax credits under the CARES Act from the US Department of Treasury and in turn paid approximately $178,500 to the service provider, netting the Company approximately $1,107,500 in credits for retaining its employees during COVID. As part of the collection process the Company retained the services of a tax service professional to provide the Company with the specialized tax services. The services included identifying various tax initiatives as well as specifically tasking the tax service professional in applying for and the tax filings for (tax) credits available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). This is a one-time other income item and we do not expect to receive this type of special income in the future. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Company received a claim for refund or right of repayment from the Seller of the Champion Entities with respect to the CARES Act tax credits income. The Company prior to September 30, 2023 settled with the Seller and agreed to pay an additional $325,000 to the seller. This amount was not offset against the CARES Act tax credit income but increased the purchase price of the Champion Entities and increased our determined Goodwill value by $325,000.\n\n37  \n---  \n  \n_Net Loss_\n\nNet loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, amounted to $3,610,929, resulting in a loss per share of $2.50, compared to $6,377,731 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, resulting in a loss per share of $33.62. The decrease in the net loss from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to one-time transactional costs related to 2022 financings and as well our preparation costs for the Champion acquisition and integration, offset by increasing costs due to a tightening jobs market and inflation. The Company’s management believes with increasing sales volume and strict adherence on cost cutting measures and best practices that net positive income can be achieved for the business into the future.\n\n**_Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2022_**\n\n_Revenue (‘Sales’) and cost of goods sold (‘Cost of Sales’)_\n\nThree months ended September 30, 2023 | Three months ended September 30, 2022  \n---|---  \nRevenue | $| 3,345,552 | $| 4,102,761  \nCost of goods sold | 3,095,418 | 3,124,657  \nGross margin | 250,134 | 978,104  \nExpenses:  \nConsulting/payroll and other costs | 1,039,273 | 1,227,953  \nRental expense, warehousing, outlet expense | 230,226 | 314,314  \nProduct development costs | 20,326 | -  \nMarketing and brand development costs | 517,345 | 119,122  \nAdministrative and other | 1,347,181 | 1,077,005  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | 24,895 | 9,956  \n3,179,246 | 2,748,350  \nOperating income (loss) | (2,929,112| ) | (1,770,246| )  \nOther Income (Expense)  \nInterest expense, net | (95,330| ) | (31,584| )  \nInterest expense – pre-emptive rights release | - | (350,000| )  \nInterest income | 3,203 | 4,428  \nEmployee retention credit funds, net of costs to collect | - | -  \nGain/(loss) on sale of equipment | - | -  \nGain/(loss) on extinguishment of debt | 227,569 | -  \n135,442 | (377,156| )  \nNet income (loss) before income tax provision | (2,793,670| ) | (2,147,402| )  \nProvision for income tax | - | -  \nNet income (loss) | $| (2,793,670| ) | $| (2,147,402| )  \n  \n38  \n---  \n  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, we reported Revenues of $3,345,552 compared to Revenues of $4,102,761 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in Revenues of $757,209 (or -18% period over period (PoP)) for the current period compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, is attributable to slower sales for 2023 and current market conditions. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we reported Cost of Goods Sold of $3,095,418, compared to Cost of Goods Sold of $3,124,657 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in Cost of Goods Sold of $29,239 (or -1% period over period (PoP)) for the current period is primarily attributable to a marginal decrease in sales for the period. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we reported Gross Margin of $250,134, compared to Gross Margin of $978,104 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in Gross Margin of $727,970 (or -74% period over period (PoP)) for the three months ending September 30, 2023, compared to the three months ending September 30, 2022 is again due a decrease in sales and increased costs of sales. Gross Margin percentages for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 8% compared to 24% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. We expect our Gross Margin percentages for this time of year to be consistently in the 20% range. If not within this range we will try to increase our sales volume to in order to increase our margins, with better pricing power, better buying power on costs of goods, inventory and of course inventory management. In general, second amendment businesses have experienced a slowdown in sales volume during the past twelve months and this is in line with what we have experienced in our business.\n\n_Operating Expenses_\n\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $3,179,246 compared to $2,748,350 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 as further described below. Overall, we experienced a $430,896 increase in operating expenses or a 16% period over period (PoP) increase in operating expenses from the prior year comparable period. With the successful integration of the Champion acquisition, we believe this will begin to drop or decrease as a percentage of Revenues as we increase our sales volume.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred consulting/payroll and other costs of $1,039,273 compared to consulting/payroll and other costs of $1,227,953 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in consulting/payroll and other costs of $188,680 (or -15% period over period (PoP)) was due to cost controls put in place on the post-acquisition of the Champion Entities. The Company expects to try and maintain its consulting/payroll and other costs as we endeavor to further expand our sales volume.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred rental expense, warehousing, outlet expense of $230,226, compared to rental expense, warehousing, outlet expense of $314,314 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in rental expense, warehousing, outlet expense of $84,088 is due to cost cutting on leases and properties that the Company rents to conduct the Champion business acquisition as well as other cost cutting measures or efficiencies put in place. Prior to the Champion business acquisition, the Company included lease expense in the Administrative and other account. With the significant number of leases and properties that the Company rents to conduct the Champion business we believe provides a better presentation of expenses with a separate account line item. The Company expects to maintain this level of expense on a go-forward basis with its leases and rented properties for the near term. The Company may look to consolidate some of its space as needed as it fine tunes the Champion business.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred product development expenses of $20,326, compared to product development expenses of $- for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in product development expenses of $20,326 (or ~% period over period (PoP)) is due to some of the Company’s current product development expenses being included in consulting/payroll and other costs account which we believe provides for a better presentation of our historical business expenses than pure product development expense. For these three months ended September 30, 2023 we’ve incurred expenses that are attributable to our private label brewery efforts and should be separated and identified. The Company expects to maintain some level of expense on a go-forward basis with new products and efforts being expended for future sales growth and product needs.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred marketing and brand development expenses of $517,345, compared to marketing and brand development expenses of $119,122 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in marketing and brand development expenses of $398,223 (or 334% period over period (PoP)) relates primarily to an increase of activities including major trade shows and the availability of working capital for these types of expenses as well as increased costs attributable to our acquisition and integration of the Champion business, as well as expenses associated with our Tony Stewart activities and general push forward on sales efforts.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred administrative and other expense of $1,347,181, compared to administrative and other expense of $1,077,005 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in administrative and other expense of $270,176 (or 25% period over period (PoP)) relates directly to increased legal and other professional fees that we incurred in our registered public offerings and capital raising efforts, along with additional expenses picked up from our acquisition of Champion. The Company believes as it grows its sales base it will also increase its administrative and other expense commensurate with the increased profits for the future.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred depreciation and amortization expense of $24,895, compared to depreciation and amortization expense of $9,956 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to the acquisition of Champion and its significant and additional depreciable asset base that it provided to the Company’s financial position.\n\n_Other income and expenses_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred interest expense of $95,330, compared to interest expense of $31,584 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in interest expense of $63,746 is due to a significant number of notes being paid during 2022 that were able to be paid in full from the various financings, offset by the increased borrowing costs that we have on our working capital notes payable and line of credit. We are currently paying an interest rate of approximately 7% on our line of credit, 12% on our existing working capital notes payable, and on our new working capital notes payable we are paying approximately 40% per annum on this debt instrument. The Company expects to manage and maintain its interest expense exposure despite the increase in interest rates for this year over last year, as well keeping our debt obligations to a minimum as we grow the business and its sales volume.\n\n_Net Loss_\n\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023, amounted to $2,793,670, resulting in a loss per share of $0.95, compared to $2,147,402 for the three months ended September 30, 2022, resulting in a loss per share of $8.90. The increase in the net loss from the three months ended September 30, 2022 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is from a myriad of expenses that the Company incurred in the quarter, such as professional and legal fees, increased costs in marketing and the softening of gross margin on sales. The Company’s management believes with increasing sales volume and strict adherence to cost cutting measures and best practices that net positive income can be achieved for the business.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nWe are a company still in the growth and acquisition stage and our revenue from operations does not cover our operating expenses. Working capital increased by $725,021 period over period where we had a working capital balance of $6,678,562 at December 31, 2022 compared to a working capital balance of $7,403,583 at September 30, 2023. This working capital increase was due to the successful closings of three financing transactions (one in February 2022, the second in July 2022 and a third one recently in June 2023) despite incurring a deficit of over $37.7 million from inception to September 30, 2023. We have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of capital stock, convertible debt, and other securities and will continue so into the near future and beyond.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we raised net cash of approximately $5,304,000 through the issuance of equity (which included the inducement to accelerate the conversion of certain warrants into equity), as compared to approximately $19,985,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we raised net cash of approximately $2,386,000 through the issuance of notes payable and entering into a line of credit with a national financial institution secured by inventory and other assets, as compared to approximately $60,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 we paid down approximately $2,607,000 in loan principal which we did not replenish.\n\n40  \n---  \n  \nAs we continue with the launch of the American Rebel branded safes and concealed carry product line as well our Champion line of products, we expect to continue to devote significant resources in the areas of capital expenditures and marketing, sales, and operational expenditures. We may from time to time incur significant capital needs for these expenditures and our business; we cannot fully predict what those needs will be and the impact to our business.\n\nWe expect to require additional funds to further develop our business and acquisition plan, including the launch of additional products in addition to aggressively marketing our safes and concealed carry product line. Since it is impossible to predict with certainty the timing and amount of funds required to establish profitability, we anticipate that we will raise additional funds through equity or debt offerings or otherwise in order to meet our expected future liquidity requirements. Any such financing that we undertake will likely be dilutive to existing stockholders.\n\nIn addition, we expect to also need additional funds to respond to business opportunities and challenges, including our ongoing operating expenses, protecting our intellectual property, developing or acquiring new lines of business and enhancing our operating infrastructure. While we may need to seek additional funding for such purposes, we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of our financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our Common Stock. We may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties. We may not be able to negotiate any such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our product lines.\n\n_Debt Restructuring_\n\nThe Company during early 2022 engaged in and completed a financial restructuring (the “Debt Restructuring”), that included extending, renewing, and restructuring the terms of loans with several investors and third-party creditors. The completion of the registered public offering in February 2022 provided the necessary funds to pay off multiple loans with several investors and third-party creditors, leaving a small but manageable amount of debt on the books.\n\n_Promissory Notes – Working Capital_\n\nAs part of the Debt Restructuring (as defined above), the Company entered into several replacement notes to extend the maturities on certain notes with working capital lending partners.\n\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company entered into a $600,000 unsecured promissory note with an accredited investor, our working capital lending partner. The unsecured promissory note bears interest at 12% per annum. The principal of the unsecured promissory note is due on March 31, 2023. The unsecured promissory note contains customary warranties, covenants and representations of the Company.\n\nOn April 14, 2023, the Company entered into a $1,000,000 Business Loan and Security Agreement (the “Secured Loan”) with an accredited investor lending source (the “Lender”). Under the Secured Loan, the Company received the loan net of fees of $20,000. The Secured Loan requires 64 weekly payments of $20,000 each, for a total repayment of $1,280,000. The Secured Loan bears interest at 41.4%. The Secured Loan is secured by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries second to a first priority lien secured the holder of the Line of Credit. Furthermore, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, provided a personal guaranty for the Secured Loan. The Secured Loan provides for a default fee of $15,000 for any late payments on the weekly payments. No prepayment of the loan is allowed as well as any default by the Company allows the Lender to take necessary actions to secure its collateral and recovery of funds. We paid approximately $300,000 in principal payments to the lender under the Secured Loan. We intend to make the payments in a timely manner, with no early repayment of the principal.\n\n41  \n---  \n  \n_Line of Credit_\n\nDuring February 2023, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Champion entered into a $2 million line of credit facility (the “Line of Credit”). The Line of Credit accrues interest at a rate determined by BSBY Daily Floating Rate plus 2.05 percentage points (which at September 30, 2023 was 7.48%), and is secured by all of the assets of the Champion Entities. The Line of Credit expires February 28, 2024. The outstanding liability of the Line of Credit at September 30, 2023 was $1.69 million. The Company has the ability to draw upon the line to the full $2 million if necessary.\n\n_Acquisition of Champion Entities and PIPE Transaction Used to Fund Acquisition_\n\nOn July 12, 2022, we sold $12,887,976 of securities to Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd., an institutional purchaser. Such securities consisted of (i) 20,373 shares of Common Stock at $27.75 per share, (ii) prefunded warrants that are exercisable into 448,097 shares of Common Stock at $27.50 per prefunded warrant, and (iii) immediately exercisable warrants to purchase up to 936,937 shares of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $21.50 per share, subject to adjustments as set forth therein, and will expire five years from the date of issuance. EF Hutton, a division of Benchmark Investments, LLC, acted as exclusive placement agent for the offering and was paid: (i) a commission of 10% of the gross proceeds ($1,288,798); (ii) non-accountable expenses of 1% of the gross proceeds ($128,880); and (iii) placement agent expenses of $125,000.\n\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company entered into a stock and membership interest purchase agreement with the Champion Entities and the Seller under the Champion Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and membership interests of the Champion Entities from the Seller.\n\nThe closing of the acquisition occurred on July 29, 2022. Under the terms of the Champion Purchase Agreement, the Company paid the Seller (i) cash consideration in the amount of $9,150,000, along with (ii) cash deposits in the amount of $350,000, and (iii) reimbursed Seller for $397,420 of agreed upon acquisitions and equipment purchases completed by the Seller and the Champion Entities since June 30, 2021.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Company received a claim for refund or right of repayment from the Seller. The Company settled with the Seller and agreed to pay an additional $325,000 to the Seller in the following manner. $275,000 upon signing of the agreement and another $50,000 to be paid over the next twelve months. The Company increased its purchase price of the Champion Entities by the $325,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The funds for this pricing adjustment came from general working capital.\n\n_Critical Accounting Policies_\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related footnotes requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\n\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.\n\nFinancial Reporting Release No. 60 requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. There are no critical policies or decisions that rely on judgments that are based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Note 1 to the financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements.\n\n42  \n---  \n  \n**Our BUSINESS**\n\n**Recent Events**\n\n_American Rebel Beer_\n\nOn August 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Brewing Agreement with Associated Brewing. Under the terms of the Brewing Agreement, Associated Brewing has been appointed as the exclusive producer and seller of American Rebel branded spirits, with the initial product being American Rebel Light Beer. American Rebel Light Beer will launch regionally in early 2024.\n\n_Acquisition of Champion Entities_\n\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company entered into a stock and membership interest purchase agreement with the Champion Entities and the Seller under the Champion Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and membership interests of the Champion Entities from the Seller. This transaction was completed on July 29, 2022. We have included the Champion Entities assets and liabilities as of that date and the subsequent financial activity through the date of this offering circular in our consolidated financial statements which consist of the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statement of operations, consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity (deficit) and consolidated statement of cash flows (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). The Champion Entities have been integrated with our existing operations and are under the control of our management team.\n\nThe closing of the acquisition occurred on July 29, 2022. Under the terms of the Champion Purchase Agreement, the Company paid the Seller (i) cash consideration in the amount of $9,150,000, along with (ii) cash deposits previously of $350,000, and (iii) reimbursement to the Seller for $397,420 of agreed upon acquisitions and equipment purchases completed by the Seller and the Champion Entities since June 30, 2021.\n\n**Corporate Summary**\n\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc. was incorporated on December 15, 2014, in the State of Nevada and is authorized to issue 600,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”).\n\nThe Company operates primarily as a designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded safes and personal security and self-defense products. Additionally, the Company designs and produces branded apparel and accessories and plans to introduce American Rebel Beer in early 2024.\n\nWe believe that when it comes to their homes, consumers place a premium on their security and privacy. Our products are designed to offer our customers convenient, efficient and secure home and personal safes from a provider that they can trust. We are committed to offering products of enduring quality that allow customers to keep their valuable belongings protected and to express their patriotism and style, which is synonymous with the American Rebel brand.\n\nOur safes and personal security products are constructed primarily of U.S.-made steel. We believe our products are designed to safely store firearms, as well as store our customers’ priceless keepsakes, family heirlooms and treasured memories and other valuables, and we aim to make our products accessible at various price points for home and office use. We believe our products are designed for safety, quality, reliability, features and performance.\n\nTo enhance the strength of our brand and drive product demand, we work with our manufacturing facilities and various suppliers to emphasize product quality and mechanical development in order to improve the performance and affordability of our products while providing support to our distribution channel and consumers. We seek to sell products that offer features and benefits of higher-end safes at mid-line price ranges.\n\nWe believe that safes are becoming a ‘must-have appliance’ in a significant portion of households. We believe our current safes provide safety, security, style and peace of mind at competitive prices.\n\n43  \n---  \n  \nIn addition to branded safes, we offer an assortment of personal security products as well as apparel and accessories for men and women under the Company’s American Rebel brand. Our backpacks utilize what we believe is a distinctive sandwich-method concealment pocket, which we refer to as Personal Protection Pocket, to hold firearms in place securely and safely. The concealment pockets on our Freedom 2.0 Concealed Carry Jackets incorporate a silent operation opening and closing with the use of a magnetic closure.\n\nWe believe that we have the potential to continue to create a brand community presence around the core ideals and beliefs of America, in part through our Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. “Andy” Ross, who has written, recorded and performs a number of songs about the American spirit of independence. We believe our customers identify with the values expressed by our Chief Executive Officer through the “American Rebel” brand.\n\nThrough our growing network of dealers, we promote and sell our products in select regional retailers and local specialty safe, sporting goods, hunting and firearms stores, as well as online, including our website and e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com.\n\nAmerican Rebel is boldly positioning itself as “America’s Patriotic Brand” in a time when national spirit and American values are being rekindled and redefined. The typical American Rebel customer loves their family, their country and their community. Our positioning statement to our customers is: _are you the type of person who will still hold open a door, come to the aid of a neighbor, or help an elderly person across the street? Are you the type of person that is prepared to defend yourself, your family, or even a room full of strangers? We have the beer that is as bold and brave as you._ We believe the time is right for American Rebel Beer, we believe we have the right expertise, and we believe we have the right brand. The beer market in the United States is a more than 110 billion dollar industry. We believe recent trends have revealed that beer consumers want to express their values through their choice of beer. We believe that American Rebel Beer will have a receptive target audience for our product. We plan to introduce American Rebel Light Beer as our first product on a regional basis in early 2024. Consumers are already registering their email addresses at www.AmericanRebelBeer.com to be notified when American Rebel Beer is available in their local market. We are also offering our American Rebel Beer can cooler as a free incentive to visit our website.\n\nAmerican Rebel is an advocate for the 2nd Amendment and conveys a sense of responsibility to teach and preach good common practices of gun ownership. American Rebel products keep you concealed and safe inside and outside the home. American Rebel Safes protect your firearms and valuables from children, theft, fire and natural disasters inside the home; and American Rebel Concealed Carry Products provide quick and easy access to your firearm utilizing American Rebel’s Proprietary Protection Pocket in its backpacks and apparel outside the home. The initial company product releases embrace the “concealed carry lifestyle” with a focus on concealed carry products, apparel, personal security and defense. “There’s a growing need to know how to protect yourself, your family, your neighbors or even a room full of total strangers,” says American Rebel’s Chief Executive Officer, Andy Ross. “That need is in the forethought of every product we design.”\n\nThe “concealed carry lifestyle” refers to a set of products and a set of ideas around the emotional decision to carry a gun everywhere you go. The American Rebel brand strategy is similar to the successful Harley-Davidson Motorcycle philosophy, referenced in this quote from Richard F. Teerlink, Harley’s chairman and former chief executive, “It’s not hardware; it is a lifestyle, an emotional attachment. That’s what we have to keep marketing to.” As an American icon, Harley has come to symbolize freedom, rugged individualism, excitement and a sense of “bad boy rebellion.” American Rebel has significant potential for branded products as a lifestyle brand. We believe our Concealed Carry Product line and Safe line serve a large and growing market segment; but it is important to note we have product opportunities beyond Concealed Carry Products and Safes.\n\n**_American Rebel Safes_**\n\nKeeping your guns in a location only appropriate trusted members of the household can access should be one of the top priorities for every responsible gun owner. Whenever a new firearm is purchased, the owner should also look for a way to store and secure it. Storing the firearm in a gun safe will prevent it from being misused by young household members, and it will also prevent it from being stolen in a burglary or damaged in a fire or natural disaster. Gun safes may seem pricy at first glance, but once the consumer is educated on their role to protect expensive firearms and other valuables such as jewelry and important documents, the price is justified.\n\n44  \n---  \n  \nAmerican Rebel produces large floor safes in a variety of sizes as well as small portable keyed safes. Additional opportunities exist for the Company to develop Wall Safes and Handgun Boxes.\n\n_Reasons gun owners should own a gun safe_ :\n\n● | If you are a gun owner and you have children, many states have a law in place that you have to have your gun locked in a safe, away from children. This will prevent your children from getting the gun and hurting themselves or someone else.  \n---|---  \n● | Some states have a law in place that you have to keep your gun locked away when it is not in use even if you don’t have children in your home. California has a law that you have to have your gun locked in a firearms safety device that is considered safe by the California Department of Justice (DOJ). When you buy a safe, you should see if it has approval from the California DOJ.  \n● | Many gun owners own more guns than insurance will cover. Many insurance companies only cover $3,000 worth of guns. Are your weapons worth more? If so, you should invest in a gun safe to make sure your guns are protected from fire, water, and thieves.  \n● | Many insurance companies may give you a discount if you own a gun safe. If you own a gun safe or you purchase one, you should see if your insurance company is one that offers a discount for this. A safe can protect your guns and possibly save you money.  \n● | Do people know you own guns? You might not know that many burglaries are carried out by people they know.  \n● | If a person you know breaks into your home, steals your gun, and murders someone you could be charged with a crime you didn’t commit, or the victim’s family could sue you.  \n● | Gun safes can protect your guns in the event your home goes up in flames. When buying a safe, you should see if it will protect your firearm or any other valuables from fire damage.  \n● | You might be the type of person that has a gun in your home for protection. A gun locked in a safe can still offer you protection. There are quick access gun safes on the market. With a quick access gun safe, you can still retrieve your gun in a few seconds, but when it isn’t needed it will be protected.  \n  \nWe believe a gun safe is the best investment a gun owner can make because the safe can protect guns from thieves, fire, water, or accidents. Bills or ballot measures to require safe storage have been discussed in Delaware, Washington, Oregon, Missouri and Virginia; and various laws are on the books in California and Massachusetts. Even a figure as staunchly pro-gun as Texas’s Republican lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, called on gun-owning parents to lock up their weapons after the Santa Fe shooting. The gun safe industry is experiencing rapid growth and innovation. American Rebel Chief Executive Officer Andy Ross and the rest of the American Rebel team are committed to fulfilling the opportunity in the gun safe market and filling the identified void with American Rebel Gun Safes.\n\nBelow is a summary of the different safes we offer:\n\ni. | _Large Safes_ – our current large model safe collection consists of six premium safes. All of our large safes share the same high-quality workmanship, are constructed out of 11-gauge U.S.-made steel and feature a double plate steel door, double-steel door casements and reinforced door edges. Each of these safes provide up to 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit. Our safes offer a fully adjustable interior to fit our customers’ needs. Depending on the model, one side of the interior may have shelves and the other side set up to accommodate long guns. There are optional additions such as Rifle Rod Kits and Handgun Hangers to increase the storage capacity of the safe. These large safes offer greater capacity for secure storage and protection, and our safes are designed to prevent unauthorized access, including in the event of an attempted theft, natural disaster or fire. We believe that a large, highly visible safe also acts as a deterrent to any prospective thief.   \n---|---  \n  \n45  \n---  \n  \nii. | _Personal Safes_ – the safes in our compact safe collection are easy to operate and carry as they fit into briefcases, desks or under vehicle seats. These personal safes meet Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) airline firearm guidelines and fit comfortably in luggage when required by travel regulations.  \n---|---  \niii. | _Vault Doors_ – our U.S.-made vault doors combine style with theft and fire protection for a look that fits any decor. Newly-built, higher-end homes often add vault rooms and we believe our vault doors, which we designed to facilitate secure access to such vault rooms, provide ideal solutions for the protection of valuables and shelter from either storms or intruders. Whether it’s in the context of a safe room, a shelter, or a place to consolidate valuables, our American Rebel in- and out-swinging vault doors provide maximum functionality to facilitate a secure vault room. American Rebel vault doors are constructed of 4 ½” double steel plate thickness, A36 carbon steel panels with sandwiched fire insulation, a design that provides greater rigidity, security and fire protection. Active boltworks, which is the locking mechanism that bolts the safe door closed so that it cannot be pried open and three external hinges that support the weight of the door, are some of the features of the vault door. For safety and when the door is used for a panic or safe room, a quick release lever is installed inside the door.  \niv. | Dispensary Safes **-** our HG-INV Inventory Safe, a safe tailor-made for the cannabis community, provides cannabis and horticultural plant home growers a reliable and safe solution to protect their inventory. Designed with medical marijuana or recreational cannabis dispensaries in mind and increasing governmental and insurance industry regulation to lock inventory after hours, we believe our HG-INV Inventory Safe delivers a high-level user experience.  \n  \n_Upcoming Product Offerings_\n\nTo further complement our diverse product offerings, we plan to introduce additional products in 2023 and 2024. Below is a summary of potential upcoming product offerings:\n\ni. Biometrics Safes – we intend to introduce a line of handgun boxes with biometrics, WiFi and Bluetooth technologies. These Biometric Safes have been designed, engineered and are ready for production.\n\nii. 2A Lockers – we have developed a unique steel lockbox with a 5-point locking mechanism to provide a secure place to lock up ammunition and other items that may not require the safety and security of a safe, but prevents unauthorized access. We believe there is a strong market for this product that is priced between $349 - $449 depending on the model.\n\niii. Wall Safes – wall safes can be easily hidden and provide “free” storage space since they are able to be tucked into the space between your wall and studs.\n\niv. Economy Safe Line – we are exploring enhancing our safe line through the introduction of entry level safes built in North America to compete with other safes imported from overseas.\n\nIn addition to introducing additional products to add to our existing lines, we are actively seeking acquisition opportunities to diversify our product offerings and enhance stockholder value.\n\n**Our Competitive Strengths**\n\nWe believe we are progressing toward long-term, sustainable growth, and our business has, and our future success will be driven by, the following competitive strengths:\n\n● Powerful Brand Identity – We believe we have developed a distinctive brand that sets us apart from our competitors. We believe this has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our brand is predicated on patriotism and quintessential American character: protecting our loved ones and expressing one’s values and beliefs. We strive to equip our safes with technologically advanced features, improved designs and accessory benefits that offer customers advanced security to provide the peace of mind they need. We believe our beer offerings are formulated for the mass appeal beer market and our can will boldly proclaim the drinker’s values as we believe the beer consumer has an almost unlimited number of options, but actually very few beer choices that clearly convey the drinker’s values. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the “American Rebel” brand is critical to expanding our enthusiasts base, network of dealers distributors and other partners. Through our beer, our safes and branded apparel and accessories, we seek to further enhance our connection with the American Rebel community and share the values of patriotism and safety for which our Company stands for. We strive to continue to meet their need for our safes and our success is anticipated to depend largely on our ability to maintain customer trust, become a gun safe storage leader and continue to provide high-quality safes. Introducing American Rebel Beer is anticipated to further expand our brand identity due to the size and potential customer base available to us in the beer market.\n\n46  \n---  \n  \n● Beverage Operations – We believe that our agreement with Associated Brewing provides an operational advantage for American Rebel Beer. Associated Brewing is a premier beverage partner that provides turn-key operational support for American Rebel Beer. Associated Brewing’s resources and expertise jump-start American Rebel’s entry into the beer market providing a base of initial scale for the Company to utilize to enter this new market.\n\n● Safe Product Design and Development – our current safe model relies on time-tested features, such as Four-Way Active Boltworks, pinning the door shut on all four sides (compared to Three-Way Bolt works, which is prevalent in many of our competitors’ safes), and benefits that would not often be available in our price point, including 12-gauge and heavier US-made steel. The sleek exterior of our American Rebel safes has garnered attention and earned the moniker from our dealers as the “safe with an attitude.” When we set out to enter the safe market, we wanted to offer a safe that we would want to buy, one that would get our attention and provide excellent value for the cost. Our Champion and Superior safes draw on decades of exemplary craftsmanship and dependability.\n\n● Focus on Safe Product Performance - since the introduction of our first safes, we have maintained a singular focus on creating a full range of safe, quality, reliable safes that were designed to help our customers store valuables. We incorporate advanced features into our safes that are designed to improve strength and durability. Key elements of our current model safes’ performance include:\n\nDouble Plate Steel Door – 4 ½” Thick*\n\nReinforced Door Edge – 7/16” Thick\n\nDouble-Steel Door Casement*\n\nSteel Walls – 11-Gauge\n\nDiameter Door Bolts – 1 ¼” Thick\n\nFour-Way Active Boltworks – AR-50(14), AR-40(12), AR-30(10), AR-20(10), AR-15(8), AR-12(8)\n\nDiamond-Embedded Armor Plate*\n\n* Double Plate Steel Door is formed from two U.S.-made steel plates with fire insulation sandwiched inside. Thicker steel is placed on the outside of the door while the inner steel provides additional door rigidity and attachment for the locking mechanism and bolt works. The door edge is reinforced with up to four layers of laminated steel. Pursuant to industry-standard strength tests performed, this exclusive design offers up to 16 times greater door strength and rigidity than the “thin metal bent to look thick” doors.\n\n* Double-Steel Door Casement is formed from two or more layers of steel and is welded around the perimeter of the door opening. Pursuant to industry-standard strength tests performed, it more than quadruples the strength of the door opening and provides a more secure and pry-resistant door mounting. Our manufacturer installs a Double-Steel Door Casement™ on our safes. We believe the reinforced door casement feature provides important security as the safe door is often a target for break-in attempts.\n\n* Diamond-Embedded Armor Plate Industrial diamond is bonded to a tungsten steel alloy hard plate. Diamond is harder than either a cobalt or carbide drill. If drilling is attempted the diamond removes the cutting edge from the drill, thus dulling the drill bit to where it will not cut.\n\n● Trusted Brand - we believe that we have trusted brands with both retailers and consumers for delivering reliable, secure safe solutions.\n\n● Customer Satisfaction - we believe we have established a reputation for delivering high-quality safes and personal security products in a timely manner, in accordance with regulatory requirements and our retailers’ delivery requirements and supporting our products with a consistent merchandising and marketing message. We also believe that our high level of service, combined with strong consumer demand for our products and our focused distribution strategy, produces substantial customer satisfaction and loyalty. We also believe we have cultivated an emotional connection with the brand which symbolizes a lifestyle of freedom, rugged individualism, excitement and a sense of bad boy rebellion.\n\n47  \n---  \n  \n● Proven Management Team - our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. Ross, Jr., has led the expansion and focus on the select product line we offer today. We believe that Mr. Ross had an immediate and positive impact on our brand, products, team members, and customers. Under Mr. Ross’s leadership, we believe that we have built a strong brand and strengthened the management team. We are refocusing on the profitability of our products, reinforcing the quality of safes to engage customers and drive sales. We believe our management team possesses an appropriate mix of skills, broad range of professional experience, and leadership designed to drive board performance and properly oversee the interests of the Company, including our long-term corporate strategy. Our management team also reflects a balanced approach to tenure that will allow the Board to benefit from a mix of newer members who bring fresh perspectives and seasoned directors who bring continuity and a deep understanding of our complex business. Our team at Associated Brewing provides expertise in the beverage industry to increase our efficiency in our American Rebel Beer launch and they are very excited about the American Rebel brand, marketing prowess and market opportunity. Associated Brewing and their affiliate copackers have significant capacity to supply American Rebel Beer.\n\n**Our Growth Strategy**\n\nOur goal is to enhance our position as a designer, producer and marketer of premium safes and personal security products. In addition, we recently announced we are entering the beverage business, through the introduction of American Rebel Beer. We have established plans to grow our business by focusing on three key areas: (1) organic growth and expansion in existing markets; (2) targeted strategic acquisitions that increase our on-premise and online product offerings, distributor and retail footprint and/or have the ability to increase and improve our manufacturing capabilities and output, and (3) expanding the scope of our operation activities to new applications and new business categories.\n\nWe have developed what we believe is a multi-pronged growth strategy, as described below, to help us capitalize on a sizable opportunity. Through methodical sales and marketing efforts, we believe we have implemented several key initiatives we can use to grow our business more effectively. We believe we made significant progress in 2022 in the sales to first-time buyers. We also intend to opportunistically pursue the strategies described below to continue our upward trajectory and enhance stockholder value. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are as follows:\n\n_Organic Growth and Expansion in Existing Markets - Build our Core Business_\n\nThe cornerstone of our business has historically been our safe product offerings. We are focused on continuing to develop our home, office and personal safe product lines. We are investing in adding what we believe are distinctive and advanced technological solutions for our safes and protective product lines.\n\nWe are working to increase floor space dedicated to our safes and strengthen our online presence in order to expand our reach to new enthusiasts and build our devoted American Rebel community. We intend to continue to endeavor to create and provide retailers and customers with what we believe are responsible, safe, reliable and stylish products, and we expect to concentrate on tailoring our supply and distribution logistics in response to the specific demands of our customers. We pledge to our customers to fight to protect their privacy just as we would fight to protect our own privacy. Customers purchase our safes with an expectation of security and privacy and we have to live up to their trust placed in us and fight for them.\n\n48  \n---  \n  \nAdditionally, our Concealed Carry Product line and Safe line serve a large market segment. We believe that interest in safes increases, as well as in our complimentary concealed carry backpacks and apparel as a byproduct, when interest of the general population in firearms increases. To this extent, the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which we believe serves as a proxy for gun sales since a background check is generally needed to purchase a firearm, reported a record number of background checks in 2020, 39,695,315. The prior annual record for background checks was 2019’s 28,369,750. In 2021, there were 38,876,673 background checks conducted, similar to that of 2020’s annual record which was 40% higher than the previous annual record in 2019. Background checks in 2023 are continuing on a pace to exceed the 2019 totals as well. While we do not expect this increase in background checks to necessarily translate to an equivalent number of additional safes purchased, we do believe it might be an indicator of the increased demand in the safe market. In addition, certain states (such as Massachusetts, California, New York and Connecticut) are starting to legislate new storage requirements in respect of firearms, which is expected to have a positive impact on the sale of safes. We have also recognized a growth in first-time gun buyers and their propensity to purchase a gun safe simultaneously with their first-time gun purchase. The previous trend was that gun buyers would wait to purchase a gun safe until multiple firearms were owned.\n\nWe continue to strive to strengthen our relationships and our brand awareness with our current distributors, dealers, manufacturers, specialty retailers and consumers and to attract other distributors, dealers, and retailers. We believe that the success of our efforts depends on the distinctive features, quality, and performance of our products; continued manufacturing capabilities and meeting demand for our safes; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising programs; and the dedicated customer support.\n\nIn addition, we seek to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty by offering distinctive, high-quality products on a timely and cost-attractive basis and by offering efficient customer service. We regard the features, quality, and performance of our products as the most important components of our customer satisfaction and loyalty efforts, but we also rely on customer service and support for growing our business.\n\nFurthermore, we intend to continue improving our business operations, including research and development, component sourcing, production processes, marketing programs, and customer support. Thus, we are continuing our efforts to enhance our production by increasing daily production quantities through equipment acquisitions, expanded shifts and process improvements, increased operational availability of our equipment, reduced equipment down times, and increased overall efficiency.\n\nWe believe that by enhancing our brand recognition, our market share might grow correspondingly. We also intend to capitalize on the dissatisfaction throughout the customer and dealer base with the Liberty Safe access code policy. Champion Safe and its legacy of nearly 25 years of craftsmanship and quality position its products as viable alternatives to Liberty Safe product. Firearm industry sources estimate that 70 million to 80 million people in the United States own an aggregate of more than 400 million firearms, creating a large potential market for our safes and personal security products. We are focusing on the premium segment of the market through the quality, distinctiveness, and performance of our products; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising efforts; and the attractiveness of our competitive pricing strategies.\n\n_Targeted Strategic Acquisitions for Long-term Growth_\n\nWe are consistently evaluating and considering acquisition opportunities that fit our overall growth strategy as part of our corporate mission to accelerate long-term value for our stockholders and create integrated value chains.\n\n**Champion Safe**\n\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company entered into a stock and membership interest purchase agreement with the Champion Entities and the Seller under the Champion Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and membership interests of the Champion Entities from the Seller.\n\nThe acquisition closed on July 29, 2022. Under the terms of the Champion Purchase Agreement, the Company paid the Seller (i) cash consideration of approximately $9,150,000, along with (ii) cash deposits in the amount of $350,000, and (iii) reimbursed the Seller for approximately $400,000 of agreed upon acquisitions and equipment purchases completed by the Seller and the Champion Entities since June 30, 2021. In addition to the payments to the Seller, the Company paid costs on behalf of and specifically associated with the acquisition of Champion and its integration into the Company’s operations of $350,000; $200,000 was paid to our investment banker in analyzing the acquisition and purchase of Champion prior to the purchase and subsequent financing in July as well as $150,000 paid to Champion’s independent PCAOB registered accounting firm to conduct their two years of audit and subsequent interim review reports.\n\n49  \n---  \n  \nBased in Provo, Utah and founded in 1999 , Champion Safe is what we believe to be one of the premier designers, manufacturers and marketers of home and gun safes in North America. Champion Safe Co. has three safe lines, which we believe feature some of the most secure and highest quality gun safes.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, we operate Champion Safe in the same manner as it operated pre-acquisition. Champion Safe, Superior Safe and Safe Guard Security Products are valuable and prominent identifiable brands in the safe industry. We plan to expand our manufacturing throughput to fill our significant backlog of orders and aggressively open new dealer accounts. As a division of the combined company, Champion Safe Company will shift its emphasis to growing revenue and increasing profitability of the combined company.\n\nChampion Safe employs more than 60 employees in their Utah factory and more than 150 employees in their Nogales, Mexico facility just south of the U.S. border. The majority of the midline and value priced safes industry-wide are manufactured in China, but Mr. Crosby, the founder and former CEO of Champion, had the foresight to build his own facility in Mexico and utilize American-made steel exclusively. Steep tariffs were imposed on China manufactured safes by the Trump administration and were continued under the first half of the Biden administration. The prices of components for the made-in-China safes have dramatically increased as well as the transportation costs to import these Chinese-made safes. Mr. Crosby’s decision to build his own facility in Mexico as opposed to importing Chinese-made safes has proven to be insightful and beneficial for Champion Safe.\n\nMr. Crosby was eager to expand his manufacturing operation and seize upon the growth opportunities in the safe business. Working closing with the American Rebel team, Mr. Crosby expanded his paint-line capacity and hinge assembly workstations. Mr. Crosby has experience in many prior economic cycles and has found the safe business to be sound in good and bad economic times. Furthermore, the current emphasis on safe storage and the capital infusion from American Rebel positions the Champion operation to grow its footprint.\n\nIn addition to the access to capital for Champion to grow its business, American Rebel will benefit from Champion’s 350 dealers, nationwide distribution network and seniority with buying groups and trade shows. American Rebel will also benefit from the increased Champion manufacturing throughput as capacity restrictions have limited American Rebel’s inventory and potential growth. The collaboration between Champion and American Rebel management teams will focus on increased manufacturing efficiencies and volume expansion.\n\n_Expand into New Business Categories_\n\nWe continually seek to target new consumer segments for our safes. As we believe that safes are becoming a must-have household appliance, we strive to establish authenticity by selling our products to additional groups, and to expand our direct-to-consumer presence through our website and our showroom in Lenexa, Kansas.\n\nWe recently entered into an agreement to introduce American Rebel Beer as a new product offering, which is anticipated to launch regionally in early 2024. The Company has strived to be innovative, building products around its brand, and is committed to becoming a leading innovator in the industries in which it competes. To that end, the Company plans to continually test new alcohol beverages and may sell them under various brand labels for evaluation of drinker interest. The Company will also continue to consider new markets for its safe products and new product applications. The Company has already identified opportunities in the cannabis industry to lock inventory after hours as well as locking cabinets for tools and automotive parts in garages. Also, Champion Safe has focused on the middle and premium segments of the safe market. We believe introducing a value line series will grow customer and dealer loyalty to our brands as nearly 60% of current safe industry sales are going to value line products. We believe our value line product will have features and benefits other value line safes won’t offer and that our value line safe will be a better product.\n\nFurther, we expect the cannabis dispensary industry to be a material growth segment for our business. Several cannabis dispensary operators have expressed interest in the opportunity to help them with their inventory locking needs although we have not entered into any agreements relating to this market niche as of the date hereof. Cannabis dispensaries have various insurance requirements and local ordinances requiring them to secure their inventory when the dispensary is closed. We have been told that a number of dispensary operators have been purchasing gun safes and independently taking out the inside themselves to allow them to store cannabis inventory. Recognizing what seems to be a growing need for cannabis dispensary operators, we have designed a safe tailor-made for the cannabis industry. With the legal cannabis hyper-growth market expected to exceed $43 billion by 2025, and an increasing number of states where the growth and cultivation of cannabis is legal ( California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington), we believe we are well positioned to address the need of dispensaries. American Rebel has a long list of dispensary operators, growers, and processors interested in the Company’s inventory control solutions. We believe that dispensary operators, growers, and processors are another fertile new growth market for our Vault Doors products, as many in the cannabis space have chosen to install entire vault rooms instead of individual inventory control safes—the American Rebel Vault Door has been the choice for that purpose.\n\n50  \n---  \n  \nFurther, we believe that American Rebel has significant potential for branded products as a lifestyle brand. As the American Rebel Brand continues to grow in popularity, we anticipate generating additional revenues from licensing fees earned from third parties who wish to engage the American Rebel community. While the Company does not currently generate material revenues from licensing fees, our management team believes the American Rebel brand name may in the future have significant licensing value to third parties that seek the American Rebel name to brand their products to market to the American Rebel target demographic. For example, a tool manufacturer that wants to pursue an alternative marketing plan for a different look and feel could license the American Rebel brand name for their line of tools and market their tools under our distinct brand. This licensee would benefit from the strong American Rebel brand with their second line of American Rebel branded tools as they would continue to sell both of the lines of tools. Conversely, American Rebel could potentially also benefit as a licensee of products. If American Rebel determines a third party has designed, engineered, and manufactured a product that would be a strong addition to the American Rebel catalog of products, American Rebel could license that product from the third-party and sell the licensed product under the American Rebel brand.\n\n**Description of Business**\n\n_Our Company_\n\nWe are intending to establish American Rebel as a lifestyle brand that presents our customers the opportunity to express their values with the products they buy. We currently operate primarily as a designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded safes and personal security and self-defense products. American Rebel acquired Champion Safe Company and its associated entities on July 29, 2022. This acquisition dramatically grew the Company’s revenues and built a solid base to position the Company for future growth. Additionally, the Company designs and produces branded accessories and apparel, including with concealment pockets. Recently, the Company has entered into an agreement with Associated Brewing to produce American Rebel Beer. The beer industry in the United States is a more than $110 Billion dollar market. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to enter the beer market at this time to present our customers with a beer they can support that aligns with their values.\n\nAmerican Rebel is boldly positioning itself as “America’s Patriotic Brand” in a time when national spirit and American values are being rekindled and redefined. The typical American Rebel customer loves their family, their country and their community. We believe the time is right for American Rebel Beer, we believe we have the right expertise, and we believe we have the right brand. Recent trends have revealed that beer consumers want to express their values through their choice of beer. We believe that American Rebel Beer will have a receptive target audience for our product. American Rebel Light Beer will be the first product introduced on a regional basis in early 2024. Consumers are already registering their email addresses at _www.AmericanRebelBeer.com_ to be notified when American Rebel Beer is available in their local market. We are also offering our American Rebel Beer can cooler as a free incentive to visit our website.\n\nOur safes have an established legacy of quality and craftsmanship since Champion Safe was founded in 1999 . We believe that when it comes to their homes, consumers place a premium on their security and privacy. Our products are designed to offer our customers convenient, efficient and secure home and personal safes from a provider that they can trust. We are committed to offering products of enduring quality that allow customers to keep their valuable belongings protected and to express their patriotism and style, which is synonymous with the American Rebel brand.\n\nOur safes and personal security products are constructed primarily of U.S.-made steel. We believe our products are designed to safely store firearms, as well as store our customers’ priceless keepsakes, family heirlooms and treasured memories and other valuables, and we aim to make our products accessible at various sizes and price points for home use. We believe our products are designed for safety, quality, reliability, features and performance.\n\n51  \n---  \n  \nTo enhance the strength of our brand and drive product demand, we work with our manufacturing team and our suppliers to emphasize product quality and mechanical development in order to improve the performance and affordability of our products while providing support to our distribution channel and consumers. We seek to sell products that offer features and benefits of higher-end safes at mid-line price ranges.\n\nWe believe that safes are becoming a ‘must-have appliance’ in a significant portion of households. We believe our current safes provide safety, security, style and peace of mind at competitive prices. We are in the process of developing an additional value-line model safe. Seventy percent of current industry-wide safe safes are from value-priced safes.\n\nIn addition to branded safes, we offer an assortment of personal security products as well as apparel and accessories for men and women under the Company’s American Rebel brand. Our backpacks utilize what we believe is a distinctive sandwich-method concealment pocket, which we refer to as Personal Protection Pocket, to hold firearms in place securely and safely. The concealment pockets on our Freedom 2.0 Concealed Carry Jackets incorporate a silent operation opening and closing with the use of a magnetic closure.\n\nWe believe that we have the potential to continue to create a brand community presence around the core ideals and beliefs of America, in part through our Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. “Andy” Ross, who has written, recorded and performs a number of songs about the American spirit of independence. We believe our customers identify with the values expressed by our Chief Executive Officer through the “American Rebel” brand.\n\nThrough our growing network of dealers, we promote and sell our products in select regional retailers and local specialty safe, sporting goods, hunting and firearms stores, as well as online, including our website and e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com.\n\n_Our Products_\n\nWe design, manufacture, market and sell branded safes and personal security products, including concealed carry/self-defense products, and design and market an apparel line and complimentary accessories. We promote and sell our products primarily through retailers using a dealer network, as well as online, through our website, and on Amazon.com, where customers can place an order for our branded backpacks and apparel items.\n\n**Safes**\n\nWe offer a wide range of home, office and personal safe models, in a broad assortment of sizes, features and styles, which are constructed with U.S.-made steel. Our safes exhibit the strength and rugged independence that America was built upon. American Rebel’s design makes keeping your firearms more secure in style. Products are marketed under the American Rebel brand. Although demand for our safes is strong across all segments of our customers, including individuals and families who wish to protect their valuables, to collectors and the dispensary servicing community, the demand for safe storage responsible solutions has been particularly strong among gun owners, sportsmen, competitive shooters and hunters alike. We expect to benefit from increasing awareness of and need for safe storage of firearms in future periods.\n\n**_Large Safes_**\n\nOur large safe collection consists of six safes in a range of sizes. All of our large safes share the same high-quality workmanship, are constructed out of 11-gauge U.S.-made steel and feature a double plate steel door, double-steel door casements and reinforced door edges. We believe that our large safes are ideal for storing valuables of significant size, and that they offer greater capacity for storage and protection. Our safes offer a fully adjustable interior to fit our customers’ needs. Depending on the model, one side of the interior may have shelves and the other side set up to accommodate long guns. The large safes are designed to be resistant to break-ins, natural disasters and fire damage, and to prevent unauthorized access and to protect your family and their valuables. A large, highly visible safe also is believed to act as a deterrent to any prospective thief. Safe storage is also top priority of our customer base who seeks to responsibly secure their firearms. Whenever a new firearm is purchased, gun owners look for our premium solution to responsibly secure them and protect their loved ones.\n\n52  \n---  \n  \nOur large safes selection includes the following:\n\n_AR-50_\n\nThe AR-50 is our biggest safe. The AR-50 safe is designed to be strong, rugged, constructed of 11-gauge American-made steel and maintains capacity to comfortably store more than 40 firearms comfortably. This premium gun safe with a double plate steel door, double-steel door casement and reinforced door edge is designed to give our customers added security and peace of mind, with 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit as well as a customized shelf solution and optional additional accessories to increase the capacity to hold firearms. 72” tall, 40” wide with a depth of 28.5”.\n\n_AR-40_\n\nThe AR-40 has the same footprint as the AR-50; however, it is 12” shorter with a capacity of more than 30 firearms. This gun safe contains a double plate steel door, double-steel door casement and reinforced door edge, designed to give our customers secure storage. It provides 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit as well as a flexible shelving system to accommodate firearm storage. The dimensions include 60” tall, 40” wide with a depth of 28.5”.\n\n_AR-30_\n\nThe AR-30 offers nearly 50,000 cubic inches of storage. Built with the same strength and ruggedness as the AR-50 and AR-40 models, this safe holds more than 20 firearms. This gun safe contains a double plate steel door, double-steel door casement and reinforced door edge. It is designed to give our customers the ability to store their firearms and valuables securely, with 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit as well as offering optional add-on accessories to increase storage capacity. The dimensions include 60” tall, 34” wide with a depth of 24.5”.\n\n_AR-20_\n\nThe AR-20 shares the quality workmanship as the other sizes with a capacity for more than 15 firearms. This gun safe contains a double plate steel door, double-steel door casement and reinforced door edge is designed to prevent theft and provide protection from fire, flood and accidental access, with 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit as well as a customized shelving solution. The dimensions include 60” tall, 28” wide with a depth of 22.5”.\n\n_AR-15_\n\nThe AR-15 fits the bill for narrow spaces with room for more than 10 firearms. Same quality construction as our other large safes including a double plate steel door, double-steel door casement and reinforced door edge is designed to give our customers added security and peace of mind, with 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit as well as a customized shelving solution. The dimensions include 60” tall, 22” wide with a depth of 22.5”.\n\n_AR-12_\n\nThe AR-12 is our shortest safe. It is the perfect size to store AR rifles, handguns and personal valuables. It has a capacity of more than 8 AR rifles. Same quality construction as our other large safes including a double plate steel door, double-steel door casement and reinforced door edge is designed to give our customers safe storage and peace of mind, with 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit as well as offering optional add-on accessories to increase storage capacity. The dimensions include 40” tall, 26” wide with a depth of 23”.\n\n**Personal safes**\n\nOur compact safes, which come in two sizes, are a responsible solution to safely secure smaller valuables or handguns. The AR-110 weighs 5 pounds and is 9.5” x 6.5” x 1.75”. The AR-120 weighs 6 pounds and is 10.5” x 7.5” x 2.1875”. These small, personal safes are easy to operate and carry as they fit into a briefcase, desk or under a vehicle seat. These personal safes meet (“TSA”) airline firearm guidelines and fit comfortably in luggage where travel regulations require it.\n\n53  \n---  \n  \n**Vault doors**\n\nOur U.S.-made Vault Doors combine style with theft and fire protection for a look that fits any decor. Designed to offer superior protection, vault rooms provide an ideal solution for the protection of the family and any valuables. Newly-built, higher-end homes often add vault rooms and we believe our vault doors, which we designed to facilitate secure access to such vault rooms, provide ideal solutions for the protection of valuables and shelter from either storms or intruders. Whether it is a safe room, a shelter, or a place to consolidate valuables, our American Rebel In-Swinging and Out-Swinging Vault Doors provide maximum functionality to a secure vault room. American Rebel vault doors are constructed of two thick, A36 carbon steel panels with sandwiched fire insulation, a design that provides greater rigidity, security and fire protection. The active boltworks and three external hinges are some of the features of the vault door. For safety and to use the door for a panic or safe room door, a quick release lever is installed inside the door.\n\n**Dispensaries**\n\nOur inventory control safe, the HG-INV Inventory Safe, provides cannabis dispensaries a reliable and safe solution. With wide-spread legalization, medical marijuana or recreational cannabis dispensaries face increasing government regulation and insurance requirements to lock their inventory after hours. Our HG-INV Inventory Safe delivers a higher level user experience with customized shelving and our inventory notation system. The HG-INV has been introduced to the dispensary industry through trade show appearances and many of our dealers are actively cultivating dispensary business. Expanding our marketing of the HG-INV can open new markets to American Rebel.\n\n**Personal Security**\n\nConcealed Carry Backpacks – consist of an assortment of sizes, features and styles. Our XL, Large, and Medium concealed carry backpacks feature our proprietary “Personal Protection Pocket” which utilizes a sandwich method to keep handguns secure and in the desired and easily accessible position. The sandwich method is comprised of two foam pads that surround or sandwich the firearm in place. The user can access the isolated Protection Pocket from either side of the backpack. We believe these distinctive concealed carry products are designed for everyday use while keeping your firearm concealed, safe and easily accessible.\n\n_The Extra-Large Freedom and Cartwright CCW Backpack_\n\nOur largest concealed carry backpack offers ample storage, including a dedicated top loading laptop pouch and additional tablet sleeve. Both compartments are padded to protect your devices. Two large open compartments make this backpack practical for carrying documents and folders or whatever you need to tote from one place to another.

The size of the main compartment opening makes this backpack practical for carrying documents, folders or whatever you need to tote from one place to another.

Available in a variety of trim color options.\n\n**Apparel**\n\nWe offer a wide range of concealed carry jackets, vests and coats for men and women, including our Freedom Jacket 2.0 which incorporates a significant advance in the operation of the concealment pocket. We also proudly offer patriotic apparel for the whole family, with the imprint of the American Rebel brand. Our apparel line serves as “point man” for the brand, often the first exposure that people have to all things American Rebel. Our branded apparel line is forever relevant, current and bold. We place emphasis on styling that complements our enthusiast customers’ lifestyle, representing the values of our community and quintessential American character. The American Rebel clothing line style is not only a fashion statement; it is the sense of pride of belonging to our patriotic family, on your adventures and in life.

Our lightweight jackets are crafted to facilitate easy firearm access for both right-handed and left-handed carriers.\n\n_American Rebel T-Shirts Collection_\n\nAmerican Rebel’s T-shirts collection is created to liberate the spirit of an endless summer inside everyone and to embrace their patriotism.\n\n**Competition**\n\n_Safes_ - The North American safe industry is dominated by a small number of companies. We compete primarily on the quality, safety, reliability, features, performance, brand awareness, and price of our products. Our primary competitors include companies such as Liberty Safe, Fort Knox Security Products, American Security, Sturdy Safe Company, Homeland Security Safes, SentrySafe and as well as certain other domestic manufacturers, as well as certain China-based manufactured safes. Safes manufactured in China, including Steelwater and Alpha-Guardian, have struggled under the import tariffs initiated under the administration of former U.S President Donald Trump and continued during the first half of the current administration. We believe that given the current substantial uncertainty related to the supply chain and delivery of international goods, we have a competitive advantage because our safes are not manufactured overseas. Our higher end safes and vault doors are made in the USA in our Provo, UT manufacturing facility, which resonates with our customer base. Our middle and value line safes are made with USA made steel in our manufacturing facility in Nogales, Mexico. The combination of having all our safes made with USA made steel along with our higher end safes and vault doors being made in America put the Company in a strong position.\n\n55  \n---  \n  \n_Beer_ - The Beer industry in the United States is highly competitive due to large domestic and international brewers and the increasing number of craft brewers and craft distilleries in this category who distribute similar products that have similar pricing and target beer drinkers. The two largest brewers in the United States, AB InBev and Molson Coors, participate actively in mass appeal beer offerings as well as the High End and Beyond Beer categories, through numerous hard seltzers, flavored malt beverages, and spirit RTDs from existing beer brands or new brands, importing and distributing import brands, and with their own domestic specialty beers, either by developing new brands or by acquiring, in whole or part, existing brands. Imported beers, such as Corona®, Heineken®, Modelo Especial® and Stella Artois®, continue to compete aggressively in the United States and have gained market share over the last ten years. All of these companies have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company. We believe our brand positioning will present opportunities for us to compete in this crowded marketplace. American Rebel won’t be all things to all people; but we do believe we can be important to a large potential market.\n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our brand and technology, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties and prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of United States registered, pending and common law trademarks to protect our brand “American Rebel”.\n\nOn May 29, 2018, US Patent No. 9,984,552, Firearm Detecting Luggage, was issued to us. The term of the patent is 20 years from the issuance date. In addition to our patent, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological development and maintain our competitive position. Trade secrets and know-how, however, can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees and independent contractors.\n\n**Regulation**\n\nThe storage of firearms and ammunition is subject to increasing federal, state and local governmental laws. While the current legislative climate does not appear to seek to limit possession of firearms, there is apparent momentum to require safe storage of firearms and ammunition. Although our safes, which are the primary driver of our sales and revenues, are designed to protect any valuables, a significant number of our safes’ end users have traditionally been gun enthusiasts, collectors, hunters, sportsmen and competitive shooters. Therefore, we expect the increasing federal, state and local governmental regulation of gun storage to have a materially positive effect on our business.\n\n**Our Customers**\n\nWe primarily market and sell our products to safe-only specialty stores and independent gun stores nationwide. We also sell our products online to individuals desiring home, personal and office protection, as well as to recreational shooters and hunters. Our customers choose us for a number of reasons, including the breadth and availability of the products we offer, our extensive expertise, and the quality of our customer service.\n\nWe believe the nature of our solutions and our high-touch customer service model strengthens relationships, builds loyalty and drives repeat business as our customers’ businesses expand. In addition, we feel as if our premium product lines and comprehensive product portfolio position us well to meet our customers’ needs. Furthermore, we fully anticipate that we will be able to leverage all of the data that we are collecting from our existing customer base to make continuous improvements to our offerings and better serve our current and new customers in the future.\n\nWe intend to expand our distribution to sporting goods stores, farm and home stores, other independent retailers as well as our online customer base upon securing additional funding and expanding our manufacturing facilities.\n\n56  \n---  \n  \n**Suppliers**\n\nWe are dependent on the continued supply of materials for the manufacturing of our safes, as well as the continued supply and manufacturing of backpacks and apparel at third-party facilities locations, which are critical to our success. Any event that causes a disruption of the operation of these facilities for even a relatively short period of time would adversely affect our ability to ship and deliver our safes and other products and to provide service to our customers. We have previously experienced, including during the first months after the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may in the future experience, launch and production ramp up delays for our products as a result of disruption at our suppliers and our suppliers’ manufacturing partners. Additionally, we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of materials for our branded safes from our suppliers could limit our sales.\n\nFurthermore, the cost of safes depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw manufacturing materials such as steel, locks, fireboard, hinges, pins and other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to these parts and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased safe prices. Moreover, any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\n\nWe currently rely on third-party suppliers to ship our products to our customers. We have found that dedicated truckloads from our warehouse to our dealers reduce freight damage and provide the overall best shipping solution. Several companies offer dedicated truckload shipping. Increased sales will offer the opportunity to establish regional distribution centers.\n\n**Sales and Marketing**\n\nWe market our products to consumers through independent safe specialty stores, select national and regional retailers, local specialty firearms stores, as well as via e-commerce. We maintain consumer-focused product marketing and promotional campaigns, which include print and digital advertising campaigns; social and electronic media; product demonstrations; point-of-sales materials; in-store training; and in-store retail merchandising. Our use of social media includes Facebook, and YouTube.\n\n_Marketing Team Aligned with Sales Force to Maximize Our Industry Visibility to Drive Revenue_\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. Ross, is familiar to many in the industry due to his twelve years on television as the host of _Maximum Archery World Tour_ and later _American Rebel,_ that was broadcast on The Outdoor Channel, Sportsman Channel and the Pursuit Channel. Our Marketing and Sales teams have established American Rebel as a brand that our customers want and a brand that they are proud to embrace and bring into their homes.\n\n_Direct Marketing_\n\nIn light of the expertise required to deliver and install safes that weigh 500-1000 pounds, direct marketing is utilized to create awareness and provide information. Our website, AmericanRebel.com, has proven to be a very valuable tool in introducing potential customers to our products. Infomercials and direct-to-consumer campaigns are vehicles to expand our reach at the appropriate time. Currently the demand from our current customers and future customer pool of independent safe specialty stores is high. As the Company grows and seeks out new customers to expand its customer base, direct marketing will be an asset for American Rebel. Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. Ross, was basically making infomercials to promote his Ross Archery products when he was filming _Maximum Archery World Tour_ during the mid-2000s.\n\n57  \n---  \n  \n_Social Media and Thought Leadership_\n\nA portion of marketing dollars will be directed to social media. American Rebel and Chief Executive Officer Charles A. Ross have large followings on social media and a dedicated social media campaign will efficiently reach large numbers of potential customers and brand adopters. We will leverage our social media assets to cross-promote locally with independent safe specialty store customers to pull out product through the sales channel. Driving demand and awareness of our products to our customers will expand their loyalty to American Rebel and increase each stores’ commitment to our brand.\n\n_Trade Shows_\n\nTrade shows have been an important medium to introducing our brand and our products. The NRA Annual Meeting, a consumer trade show, is a valuable opportunity to meet and greet our final customers. When we launched our Concealed Carry line of products at the NRA Annual Meeting in Atlanta, GA, in the Spring of 2017, the response from the meeting attendees was overwhelming. We immediately knew the product line resonated with consumers. Similarly, when we introduced our line of safes at the 2019 NRA Annual Meeting in the Spring of 2019, we knew we were on to something significant. The USCCA (United States Concealed Carry Association) has an annual Concealed Carry and Home Defense Expo. This is also an excellent opportunity to meet, greet and sell product to our final customers, the buying public. The Iowa Deer Classic and Illinois Deer Classic are carryovers from our Chief Executive Officer Charles A. Ross’ hosting duties on _Maximum Archery World Tour_ , but we have found that many potential safe buyers attend these shows.\n\nThree industry-only trade shows we attend are the SHOT Show, Nation’s Best Sports (NBS) Spring and Fall Buying Markets, and the Sports, Inc trade show. The SHOT Show is very high-profile show that most movers and shakers in the firearms industry attend. Operated by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the SHOT Show is the first trade show of the calendar year and is a great opportunity to introduce the year’s new products. NBS operates buying group shows where retailers who are members of NBS attend the Spring and Fall Market Buying shows to place orders. NBS provides an excellent base of customers for us to introduce our products to. Sports, Inc. is also a buying group show where retailers who are members of Sports, Inc. attend to make purchases from attending vendors.\n\n_Paid Advertising_\n\nWe will occasionally purchase paid print advertising to support editorial and events. The American Shooting Journal has been very supportive of our business has featured an interview with our Chief Executive Officer in one of past issues of the magazine.\n\n**Legal Proceedings**\n\nThere are no proceedings to which any director or officer, or any associate of any such director or officer, is a party that is adverse to our Company or any of our subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to our Company or any of our subsidiaries. No director or executive officer has been a director or executive officer of any business which has filed a bankruptcy petition or had a bankruptcy petition filed against it during the past ten years. No current director or executive officer has been convicted of a criminal offense or is the subject of a pending criminal proceeding during the past ten years. No current director or executive officer has been the subject of any order, judgment or decree of any court permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities during the past ten years. No current director or officer has been found by a court to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law during the past ten years.\n\nFrom time to time, however, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.\n\n**_Corporate History_**\n\nThe Company was incorporated on December 15, 2014, under the laws of the State of Nevada, as CubeScape, Inc.

Holders of our Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends at a per annum rate of 8.53% of the stated value (or $0.16 per share per quarter based on the liquidation preference per share); provided that upon an event of default (generally defined as our failure to pay dividends when due or to redeem shares when requested by a holder), such amount shall be increased to $0.225 per quarter, which is equivalent to the annual rate of 12% of the $7.50 liquidation preference per share. In our sole discretion, dividends may be paid in cash or in kind in the form of Common Stock equal to the closing price of Common Stock on the last day of the quarter. Dividends on each share begin accruing on, and are cumulative from, the date of issuance and regardless of whether our Board declares and pays such dividends. Dividends on shares of our Series C Preferred Stock will continue to accrue even if any of our agreements prohibit the current payment of dividends or we do not have earnings.\n\n__Liquidation Preference__. Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, holders of shares of our Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, before any payment or distribution is made to the holders of our Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock and on a _junior_ basis with holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, a liquidation preference equal to the stated value per share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not declared).\n\n76  \n---  \n  \n__Company Call Option__. We may redeem the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or in part at any time after the fifth anniversary of the initial closing of this Offering and continuing indefinitely thereafter, at our option, for cash, at $11.25 per share of Series C Preferred Stock, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.\n\n__Stockholder Put Option__. Once per calendar quarter beginning any time after the fifth-year anniversary of date of issuance, a Holder of record of shares of Series C Preferred Stock may elect to cause us to redeem all or any portion of their shares of Series C Preferred Stock for an amount equal to $11.25 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, which amount may be settled by delivery of cash or shares of Common Stock, at the option of the holder. If the holder elects settlement in shares of Common Stock, we will deliver such number of shares of Common Stock equal to $11.25 per share of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to the redeemed shares, divided by $2.25 per share (subject to pro rata adjustment in connection with any stock splits, stock dividends, or similar changes to the Company’s capitalization occurring after the date of this Certificate), with any fraction rounded up to the next whole share of Common Stock. A holder making such election shall provide written notice thereof to us specifying the name and address of the holder, the number of shares to be redeemed and whether settlement shall be in cash or shares of Common Stock. We shall redeem the specified shares of Series C Preferred Stock for shares of Common Stock no later than ten (10) days, or for cash no later than 365 days, following receipt of such notice.\n\nPlease see the certificate of designation, which has been filed as an exhibit to the offering statement of which this offering circular forms a part, for the procedures to request a redemption.\n\n__Restrictions on Redemption and Repurchase_._ We are not be obligated to redeem or repurchase shares of Series C Preferred Stock if we are restricted by applicable law or our articles of incorporation from making such redemption or repurchase or to the extent any such redemption or repurchase would cause or constitute a default under any borrowing agreements to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party or otherwise bound. In addition, we have no obligation to redeem shares in connection with a redemption request made by a holder if we determine, as of the redemption date, that we do not have sufficient funds available to fund that redemption. In this regard, we will have complete discretion under the certificate of designation for the Series C Preferred Stock to determine whether we are in possession of “sufficient funds” to fund a redemption request. Redemptions will be limited to five percent (5%) of the total outstanding Shares per quarter. To the extent we are unable to complete redemptions we may have earlier agreed to make, we will complete those redemptions promptly after we become able to do so, with all such deferred redemptions being satisfied on a first come, first served, basis.\n\n__Voting Rights__. The Series C Preferred Stock has no voting rights relative to matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (other than as required by law). We may not authorize or issue any class or series of equity securities ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or distributions upon liquidation (including securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such senior securities) or amend our articles of incorporation (whether by merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to materially and adversely change the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock without the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on such matter by holders of our outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, voting together as a class.\n\n__Further Issuances__. We will not be required to redeem shares of our Series C Preferred Stock at any time except as otherwise described above under the captions “Company Call Option” and “Stockholder Put Option.” Accordingly, the shares of our Series C Preferred Stock will remain outstanding indefinitely, unless we decide, at our option, to exercise our call right, the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock exercises their put right. The shares of Series C Preferred Stock will not be subject to any sinking fund.\n\n__Conversion at Option of Holder__. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be convertible into shares of Common Stock at a price per share of $1.50 (1 share of Series C Preferred Stock converts into 5 shares of Common Stock), at the option of the holder thereof, at any time following the issuance date of such share of Series C Preferred Stock and on or prior to the fifth (5th) day prior to a redemption date, if any, as may have been fixed in any redemption notice with respect to the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, at our office or any transfer agent for such stock. The conversion price ($1.50) shall _not_ be adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar events.\n\n__Forced Conversion__ – If the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock during any ten consecutive trading day period has been at or above $2.25 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends recapitalizations and similar events), then the Company shall have the right to require the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock to convert all, or any portion of, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by such holder for shares of Common Stock. If the Company elects to cause a forced conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock then it must simultaneously take the same action with respect to all of the other shares of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding on a pro rata basis.\n\n__Registration of Underlying Shares of Common Stock__. In this offering we are registering with the Commission up to 13,333,330 shares of Common Stock underlying the Series C Preferred Stock. \n\n77  \n---  \n  \n**Anti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions of Nevada Law**\n\nProvisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, could make it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or to remove incumbent officers and directors. These provisions, summarized below, would be expected to discourage certain types of takeover practices and takeover bids our Board may consider inadequate and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us will outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging takeover or acquisition proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.\n\n**Public Offering Warrants**\n\n_Overview._ The following summary of certain terms and provisions of the Existing Warrants is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the provisions of the applicable warrant agency agreement between us and Action Stock Transfer, as the Warrant Agent, and the form of warrant, both of which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. Prospective investors should carefully review the terms and provisions set forth in the applicable warrant agency agreement, including the annexes thereto, and form of warrant.\n\nThe Existing Warrants entitle the registered holder to purchase shares of Common Stock at a price equal to $50.25 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, immediately following the issuance of such warrant and terminating at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five years after their original issuance.\n\nThe exercise price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Existing Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances, including in the event of a stock dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the Existing Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of Common Stock at prices below its exercise price.\n\n_Exercisability_. The Existing Warrants are exercisable at any time after their original issuance and at any time up to the date that is five (5) years after their original issuance. The Existing Warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the Warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the Warrant Agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the Warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price, by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of Existing Warrants being exercised. Under the terms of the applicable warrant agreement, we must use our best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement and current prospectus relating to Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Existing Warrants until the expiration of the Existing Warrants. If we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement and current prospectus relating to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Existing Warrants, the holders of the Existing Warrants shall have the right to exercise the Existing Warrants solely via a cashless exercise feature provided for in the Existing Warrants, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and current prospectus.\n\n_Exercise Limitation_. A holder may not exercise any portion of an Existing Warrant to the extent that the holder, together with its affiliates and any other person or entity acting as a group, would own more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock after exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Warrant, except that upon prior notice from the holder to us, the holder may waive such limitation up to a percentage not in excess of 9.99%.\n\n_Exercise Price._ The exercise price per whole share of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Existing Warrants is $50.25.

No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants. As to any fraction of a share which the holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company will round up or down, as applicable, to the nearest whole share.\n\n_Transferability._ Subject to applicable laws, the Existing Warrants may be offered for sale, sold, transferred or assigned without our consent.\n\n78  \n---  \n  \n_Warrant Agent; Global Certificate._ The Existing Warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agency agreement between the Warrant Agent and us. The Existing Warrants shall initially be represented only by one or more global warrants deposited with the Warrant Agent, as custodian on behalf of The Depository Trust Company (DTC) and registered in the name of Cede & Co., a nominee of DTC, or as otherwise directed by DTC.\n\n_Fundamental Transactions._ In the event of a fundamental transaction, as described in the Existing Warrants and generally including any reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification of our shares of Common Stock, the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of our properties or assets, our consolidation or merger with or into another person, the acquisition of more than 50% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, or any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of 50% of the voting power represented by our outstanding Common Stock, the holders of the Existing Warrants will be entitled to receive the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that the holders would have received had they exercised the Existing Warrants immediately prior to such fundamental transaction.\n\n_Rights as a Stockholder._ The Warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of shares of Common Stock or any voting rights until they exercise their Existing Warrants and receive shares of Common Stock. After the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Existing Warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.\n\n_Governing Law_. The Existing Warrants and the applicable warrant agency agreement are governed by New York law.\n\n**Armistice Warrants**\n\nOn September 8, 2023, we entered into an inducement letter (the “Inducement Letter”) with Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. (“Armistice”), the holder of existing warrants, made up of common stock purchase warrants, to purchase shares of Common Stock. The existing warrants were issued on July 8, 2022 and June 28, 2023 and had an exercise price of $4.37 and $4.24, respectively per share.\n\nPursuant to the Inducement Letter, Armistice agreed to exercise for cash their existing warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,988,687 shares of Common Stock at a reduced exercise price of $1.10 per share in consideration for our agreement to issue two new common stock purchase warrants (the “New Warrant A” and the “New Warrant B” and, together, the “New Warrants”), as described below, to purchase, in the aggregate, up to 5,977,374 shares of Common Stock (the “New Warrant Shares”). We received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $3,287,555.70 from the exercise of the existing warrants. Prior to the foregoing transaction, we had 3,151,883 shares of Common Stock outstanding.\n\nEach New Warrant will have an exercise price equal to $1.10 per share. The New Warrants will be immediately exercisable from the date of issuance until the five-year anniversary of the issuance date. The exercise price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits, subsequent rights offerings, pro rata distributions, reorganizations, or similar events affecting our Common Stock and the exercise price.\n\nThe New Warrants will be exercisable, at the option of Armistice, in whole or in part, by delivering to us a duly executed exercise notice accompanied by payment in full, within one trading day of such exercise of the New Warrant, for the number of shares of Common Stock purchased upon such exercise (except in the case of a cashless exercise as discussed below). Armistice (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of its New Warrants to the extent that they would own more than 4.99% (or, at the election of Armistice, 9.99%) of the outstanding Common Stock immediately after exercise, except that upon prior notice from Armistice to us, they may increase or decrease the amount of ownership of outstanding stock after exercising their New Warrants up to 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the New Warrants, provided that any increase will not be effective until 61 days following notice to us.\n\nNew Warrant A is subject to anti-dilution adjustment to its exercise price in the event of certain issuances of shares of our Common Stock.\n\n79  \n---  \n  \nThere is no established trading market for the New Warrants, and we do not expect an active trading market to develop. We do not intend to apply to list the New Warrants on any securities exchange or other trading market. Without a trading market, the liquidity of the New Warrants will be extremely limited.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in the New Warrants or by virtue of Armistice’s ownership of shares of our Common Stock, Armistice does not have the rights or privileges of a holder of our Common Stock, including any voting rights, until they exercise the New Warrants. The New Warrants will provide that the holders of the New Warrants have the right to participate in distributions or dividends paid on our shares of Common Stock.\n\nIf at any time the New Warrants are outstanding, we, either directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects a fundamental transaction (as defined in the New Warrant), Armistice will be entitled to receive, upon exercise of the New Warrants, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that such holder would have received had they exercised the New Warrants immediately prior to the fundamental transaction. As an alternative, and at Armistice’s option in the event of a fundamental transaction, exercisable at the earliest to occur of (i) the public disclosure of any change of control, (ii) the consummation of any change of control, and (iii) Armistice first becoming aware of any change of control through the date that is 90 days after the public disclosure of the consummation of such change of control by us pursuant to a current report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission , we shall purchase the unexercised portion of the New Warrant from Armistice by paying to them an amount of cash equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined in the Warrant) of the remaining unexercised portion of the New Warrant on the date of the consummation of such fundamental transaction.\n\nThe New Warrants may be modified or amended or the provisions of the New Warrants waived with us and Armistice’s written consent.\n\nThe above disclosure contains only a brief description of the material terms of the Inducement Letter and does not purport to be a complete description of the rights and obligations of the parties thereunder, and such description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Inducement Letter, the form of which is attached to this offering circular and is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**Transfer Agent, Warrant Agent and Registrar**\n\nThe Transfer Agent for our Common Stock is Securities Transfer Corporation, 2901 N. Dallas Parkway, Suite 380, Plano, Texas 75039. Its telephone number is (469) 633-0101.\n\n80  \n---  \n  \n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nThe Company is offering up to 2,666,666 shares of Series C Preferred Stock on a “best efforts” basis at a price of $7.50 per share.

After each closing, funds tendered by investors will be available to the Company.\n\n**Engagement Agreement with Digital Offering**\n\nWe are currently party to an engagement agreement dated June 28, 2023 with Digital Offering, LLC (“Digital Offering” or the “lead selling agent”). Digital Offering has agreed to act as our lead selling agent for the offering. Digital Offering has made no commitment to purchase all or any part of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock being offered but has agreed to use its best efforts to sell such shares in the offering. As such, Digital Offering is an “underwriter” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. Digital Offering is under no obligation to purchase any of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock or arrange for the sale of any specific number or dollar amount of shares of Series C Preferred Stock. The term of the engagement agreement began on June 28, 2023 and will continue until the earliest to occur of: (a) the date that either party gives the other at least ten (10) days written notice of the termination of the engagement agreement, which termination may occur with or without cause, (b) the date which is one year from this offering being qualified by the Commission, and (c) the date that the offering is consummated (such applicable date, the “Termination Date”). The engagement agreement provides that Digital Offering may engage other Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) member broker-dealers that are registered with the Commission to participate as soliciting dealers for this offering. We refer to these other broker-dealers as soliciting dealers or members of the selling group. Upon engagement of any such soliciting dealer, Digital Offering will be permitted to re-allow all or part of its fees and expense allowance as described below. Such soliciting dealer will also be entitled to receive the benefits of our engagement agreement with Digital Offering, including the indemnification rights arising under the engagement agreement upon their execution of a soliciting dealer agreement with Digital Offering that confirms that such soliciting dealer is so entitled. As of the date hereof, we have been advised that Digital Offering has retained Cambria Capital LLC, and DealMaker Securities LLC to participate in this offering as soliciting dealers. We will not be responsible for paying any placement agency fees, commissions or expense reimbursements to any soliciting dealers retained by Digital Offering. None of the soliciting dealers is purchasing any of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock in this offering or is required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, but will instead arrange for the sale of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to investors on a “best efforts” basis, meaning that they need only use their best efforts to sell the shares of Series C Preferred Stock. In addition to the engagement agreement, we plan to enter into a definitive selling agency agreement with Digital Offering prior to the commencement of the offering.\n\n**_Offering Expenses_**\n\nWe are responsible for all offering fees and expenses, including the following: (i) fees and disbursements of our legal counsel, accountants, and other professionals we engage; (ii) fees and expenses incurred in the production of offering documents, including design, printing, photograph, and written material procurement costs; (iii) all filing fees, including those charged by FINRA; (iv) all of the legal fees related to FINRA clearance; and (v) $50,000 in accountable expenses of Digital Offering, including for travel expenses associated with site visits, tech fees and other related fees. This $50,000 has already been paid to Digital Offering by us. We have agreed to reimburse Digital Offering for its reasonable and documented legal costs up to a maximum of $85,000, $25,000 of which has been paid to date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the two advances received by Digital Offering and discussed above will be reimbursed to us to the extent not actually incurred in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(4)(a).\n\n81  \n---  \n  \n**_Reimbursable Expenses in the Event of Termination_**\n\nIn the event the offering does not close or the selling agency agreement is terminated for any reason, we have agreed to reimburse Digital Offering for all unreimbursed, reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket fees, expenses, and disbursements, including its legal fees.\n\n**_Other Expenses of the Offering_**\n\nThe Lead Selling Agent has engaged DealMaker Securities LLC as a soliciting dealer to assist in the placement of our shares of Series C Preferred Stock in those states where it is registered to undertake such activities, including soliciting potential investors on a best efforts basis.\n\nIn addition, the Company has retained DealMaker Reach LLC (“Reach”) for marketing and advisory services.

To the extent services under this agreement are commenced in advance of a FINRA no objection letter being received by us, such amounts shall be considered an advance against accountable expenses anticipated to be incurred, and fully refunded to extent not actually incurred, in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(4)(a). A maximum of $36,000 or three months of account management fees are payable prior to a no objection letter being received.\n\nThe Company has also engaged, through its agreement with Reach, Novation Solutions Inc. operating as DealMaker (“DealMaker”), an affiliate of DealMaker Securities, LLC, to create and maintain the online subscription processing platform for the offering. After the Company’s offering statement is qualified by the SEC, the offering will be conducted, in part, using DealMaker’s online subscription processing platform through the Company’s website, whereby investors will receive, review, execute and deliver subscription agreements electronically as well as make purchase price payments through a third-party processor by ACH debit transfer, wire transfer or credit card. Novation Solutions, Inc. has not received, is not receiving and will not receive any compensation for its services.\n\n**_Selling Agents’ Commission_**\n\nWe have agreed that the definitive selling agency agreement will provide for us to pay a commission of 7.72% of the gross proceeds received by us in the offering, which shall be allocated by Digital Offering to members of the selling group and soliciting dealers in its sole discretion (we sometimes refer to Digital Offering and such members and dealers collectively as the “Selling Agents”).\n\nThe following table shows the total commissions payable to Digital Offering on a per-share basis in connection with this offering, assuming a fully subscribed offering.\n\nPer Share  \n---  \nPublic offering price | $| 7.50  \nDigital Offering commission (7.72%)* | $| 0.579  \nProceeds, before expenses, to us, per share | $| 6.921  \n  \n*Assuming a fully subscribed offering, Digital Offering would receive total commissions of $1,545,499.61\n\nDigital Offering has entered into an agreement with EF Hutton pursuant to which in exchange for EF Hutton’s waiving its right of first refusal to participate in the offering. Digital Offering will pay EF Hutton, out of its 7.72% commission, 1.02% of the gross proceeds received by them in the offering.\n\n**Lock-Up Agreements**\n\nProvided that our Series C Preferred Stock is listed on Nasdaq, we have agreed with Digital Offering, subject to certain exceptions, that, without the prior written consent of Digital Offering, we will not, directly or indirectly, during the period ending 180 days following the closing of this offering, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of or transfer any shares of our capital stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our capital stock.\n\nThe lock-up agreement does not apply to securities issued hereunder, or to securities issued pursuant to existing employee benefit plans or securities issued upon exercise of options.\n\n82  \n---  \n  \n**Exchange Listing**\n\nWe intend to apply to the Nasdaq Capital Market to list shares of our Series C Preferred Stock under the symbol “AREBP” on the Nasdaq Capital Market after the final closing of the Offering. In order to meet one of the requirements for listing our Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq, Digital Offering and other soliciting dealers intend to sell lots of 100 or more shares to a minimum of 400 beneficial holders. Our Series C Preferred Stock will not commence trading on Nasdaq until each of the following conditions is met: (i) this offering is terminated; (ii) we have filed a post-qualification amendment to the offering statement, which post-qualification amendment is qualified by the Commission; and (iii) we have filed a registration statement on Form 8-A, which Form 8-A has been declared effective by the Commission. Pursuant to applicable rules under Regulation A, the Form 8-A will not become effective until the Commission qualifies the post-qualification amendment. We intend to file the post-qualification amendment and request its qualification immediately prior to the termination of this offering in order that the Form 8-A may become effective as soon as practicable thereafter. Even if we meet the minimum requirements for listing on Nasdaq, we may wait before terminating this offering and commencing the trading of our Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq in order to raise additional proceeds. As a result, you may experience a delay between the closing of your purchase of shares of our Series C Preferred Stock and the commencement of exchange trading of our Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq. No assurance can be given, however, that our application to list on Nasdaq will be approved or that an active trading market for our Series C Preferred Stock will develop.\n\n**Pricing of the Offering**\n\nPrior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares of Series C Preferred Stock. The initial public offering price has been determined by negotiation between us and Digital Offering. The principal factors considered in determining the initial public offering price include:\n\n● | the information set forth in this offering circular and otherwise available to Digital Offering;  \n---|---  \n● | our history and prospects and the history of and prospects for the industry in which we compete;  \n---|---  \n● | our past and present financial performance;  \n---|---  \n● | our prospects for future earnings and the present state of our development;  \n---|---  \n● | an assessment of our management;  \n---|---  \n● | the general condition of the securities markets at the time of this offering;  \n---|---  \n● | the recent market prices of, and demand for, publicly traded Common Stock of generally comparable companies; and  \n---|---  \n● | other factors deemed relevant by Digital Offering and us.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Indemnification and Control**\n\nWe have agreed to indemnify the Lead Selling Agent, its affiliates and controlling persons and members of the selling group against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. If we are unable to provide this indemnification, we will contribute to the payments the Lead Selling Agent, its affiliates and controlling persons as may be required to make in respect of these liabilities.\n\nThe Lead Selling Agent and its affiliates are engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Lead Selling Agent and its affiliates may in the future perform various financial advisory and investment banking services for us, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.\n\n83  \n---  \n  \n**Our Relationship with the Lead Selling Agent**\n\nIn the ordinary course of their various business activities, Digital Offering and its affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Company. Digital Offering and its affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.\n\n**Investment Limitations if We Do Not Obtain a Listing on a National Securities Exchange**\n\nAs set forth in Title IV of the JOBS Act, there would be no limit on how many shares an investor may purchase if this offering results in a listing of our Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq or other national securities exchange. However, our Series C Preferred Stock will not be listed on Nasdaq upon the initial qualification of this offering by the Commission. Additionally, we cannot provide any assurance that our application to list on Nasdaq will be approved.\n\nFor individuals who are not accredited investors, if we are not listed on Nasdaq, no sale may be made to you in this offering if the aggregate purchase price you pay is more than 10% of the greater of your annual income or net worth (please see under “— Procedures for Subscribing — How to Calculate Net Worth”). Different rules apply to accredited investors and non-natural persons. Before making any representation that your investment does not exceed applicable thresholds, we encourage you to review Rule 251(d)(2)(i)(C) of Regulation A.

In each such case, the account will be an account owned by the investor and held at the clearing firm of such Other Broker-Dealer, as the clearing firm for the exclusive benefit of such investor. The investor will also be required to complete and submit a subscription agreement. Subscriptions for shares Series C Preferred Stock acquired through an account at Cambria Capital, or an Other Broker-Dealer can be processed online at https://form.jotform.com/232956832752162 or provided directly by the Broker-Dealers.

The clearing firm, as the clearing firm, will maintain the individual stockholder beneficial records for accounts at Cambria Capital or Other Broker-Dealers. All other investors that participate through the Wilmington Trust Escrow Account, shall have their shares held at Securities Transfer Corporation in digital book entry. Such shares may be transferred to the investor’s outside brokerage account by requesting their outside broker dealer to effect such transfer. Request for transfer may only be made by the outside broker dealer of the investor.\n\nYou may not subscribe to this offering prior to the date this offering is qualified by the Commission, which we will refer to as the qualification date. Before the qualification date, you may only make non-binding indications of your interest to purchase securities in the offering. For any subscription agreements received after the qualification date, we have the right to review and accept or reject the subscription in whole or in part, for any reason or for no reason. If a closing doesn’t occur or a subscription is rejected and the investor has an account with My IPO or another clearing broker, funds for such subscription will not be debited from My IPO or other clearing broker and the subscription will be cancelled. If accepted, the funds will remain in the escrow account or clearing firm account until we determine to have the closing of the offering and the funds in escrow or in the clearing firm account will then be transferred into our general account.\n\n86  \n---  \n  \nNon-U.S. investors may participate in this offering by depositing their funds in the escrow account held at Wilmington Trust, N.A.; any such funds that Wilmington Trust receives shall be held in escrow until the closing of this offering or such other time as mutually agreed between the Company and the Selling Agents, and then used to complete securities purchases, or returned if this offering fails to close.\n\n**_DealMaker Securities LLC_**\n\nInvestors who invest through DealMaker Securities LLC may subscribe through invest.americanrebel.com by tendering funds by wire, credit, or debit card or ACH transfer to the escrow account to be set up at Enterprise Bank. Tendered funds will remain in escrow until a closing has occurred. Upon each closing, funds tendered by investors will be made available to the Company for its use. The Company will not cover credit card fees on behalf of investors.\n\n**_Procedures for subscribing directly through the Company’s website_**\n\nThe subscription procedure is summarized as follows:\n\n1. | Go to the www.american rebel.com website and click on the “Invest Now” button;  \n---|---  \n2. | Complete the online investment form;  \n3. | Deliver funds directly by wire, debit card, credit card or electronic funds transfer via ACH to the specified escrow account;  \n4. | Once funds or documentation are received an automated AML check will be performed to verify the identity and status of the investor;  \n5. | Once AML is verified, investor will electronically receive, review, execute and deliver to us a Subscription Agreement. Investors will be required to complete a subscription agreement in order to invest. For so long as we are not listed on Nasdaq, the subscription agreement will include a representation by the investor to the effect that, if the investor is not an “accredited investor” as defined under securities law, the investor is investing an amount that does not exceed the greater of 10% of his or her annual income or 10% of your net worth (excluding the investor’s principal residence).  \n  \n**_Right to Reject Subscriptions_**\n\nAfter we receive your complete, executed subscription agreement (forms of which are attached to the offering statement, of which this offering circular forms a part, as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2) and the funds required under the subscription agreement have been transferred to the Wilmington Trust Escrow Account or such other selected dealer designated escrow account, we have the right to review and accept or reject your subscription in whole or in part, for any reason or for no reason. We will return all monies from rejected subscriptions immediately to you, without interest or deduction.\n\n**_Acceptance of Subscriptions_**\n\nUpon our acceptance of a subscription agreement, we will countersign the subscription agreement and issue the shares of subscribed for Series C Preferred Stock at closing. Once you submit the subscription agreement and it is accepted, you may not revoke or change your subscription or request your subscription funds. All accepted subscription agreements are irrevocable.\n\nUnder Rule 251 of Regulation A, unless a company’s offered securities are listed on a national securities exchange, non-accredited, non-natural person investors are subject to the investment limitation and may only invest funds which do not exceed 10% of the greater of the purchaser’s revenue or net assets (as of the purchaser’s most recent fiscal year end). As a result, for so long as our Series C Preferred Stock is not listed on Nasdaq, non-accredited, natural person may only invest funds in our Series C Preferred Stock which do not exceed 10% of the greater of the purchaser’s annual income or net worth (please see below on how to calculate your net worth).\n\n87  \n---  \n  \n**How to Calculate Net Worth**\n\nFor the purposes of calculating your net worth, it is defined as the difference between total assets and total liabilities. This calculation must exclude the value of your primary residence and may exclude any indebtedness secured by your primary residence (up to an amount equal to the value of your primary residence). In the case of fiduciary accounts, net worth and/or income suitability requirements may be satisfied by the beneficiary of the account or by the fiduciary, if the fiduciary directly or indirectly provides funds for the purchase of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock.\n\nIn order to purchase the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and prior to the acceptance of any funds from an investor, for so long as our Series C Preferred Stock is not listed on Nasdaq, an investor in our Series C Preferred Stock will be required to represent, to the Company’s satisfaction, that he or she is either an accredited investor or is in compliance with the 10% of net worth or annual income limitation on investment in this offering.\n\n**No Minimum Offering Amount**\n\nThere is no minimum offering amount in this offering and we may close on any funds that we receive. Potential investors should be aware that there can be no assurance that any other funds will be invested in this offering other than their own funds.\n\n**No Selling Security holders**\n\nNo securities are being sold for the account of security holders; all net proceeds of this offering will go to the Company**.**\n\n**Transfer Agent and Registrar**\n\nThe Company has engaged Securities Transfer Corporation, a registered transfer agent with the Commission, who will serve as transfer agent to maintain stockholder information on a book-entry basis.\n\n**DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES LIABILITIES**\n\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, subject to the provisions of Nevada law, contain provisions that allow the Company to indemnify any person against liabilities and other expenses incurred as the result of defending or administering any pending or anticipated legal issue in connection with service to us if it is determined that person acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed was in the best interest of the Company. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our executive officers and directors that provide our executive officers and directors with contractual rights to indemnification, and expense advancement and reimbursement, to the fullest extent permitted under the laws of the State of Nevada in effect from time to time, subject to certain exceptions contained in those agreements. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our director and officers, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\n88  \n---  \n  \n**Provisions of Note in our Subscription Agreement**\n\n**_Forum Selection Provision_**\n\nThe subscription agreement that investors will execute in connection with the offering includes a forum selection provision that requires any claims against the Company based on the subscription agreement to be brought in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Nevada, for the purpose of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or based upon the agreement. Although we believe the provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Nevada law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies and in limiting our litigation costs, to the extent it is enforceable, the forum selection provision may limit investors’ ability to bring claims in judicial forums that they find favorable to such disputes and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. The Company has adopted the provision to limit the time and expense incurred by its management to challenge any such claims. As a company with a small management team, this provision allows its officers to not lose a significant amount of time traveling to any particular forum so they may continue to focus on the operations of the Company. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. We believe that the exclusive forum provision applies to claims arising under the Securities Act, but there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision in this context. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Investors will not be deemed to have waived the Company’s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\n\n**_Jury Trial Waiver_**\n\nThe subscription agreement that investors will execute in connection with the offering provides that subscribers waive the right to a jury trial of any claim they may have against us arising out of or relating to the agreement, other than claims arising under federal securities laws. If we opposed a jury trial demand based on the waiver, a court would determine whether the waiver was enforceable given the facts and circumstances of that case in accordance with applicable case law. In addition, by agreeing to the provision, subscribers will not be deemed to have waived the Company’s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n**Offer Restrictions Outside the United States**\n\nOther than in the United States, no action has been taken by us or the lead selling agent that would permit a public offering of the securities offered by this offering circular in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. The securities offered by this offering circular may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this offering circular or any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the offer and sale of any such securities be distributed or published in any jurisdiction, except under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of that jurisdiction. Persons into whose possession this offering circular comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering and the distribution of this offering circular. This offering circular does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities offered by this offering circular in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or a solicitation is unlawful.\n\n89  \n---  \n  \n**LEGAL MATTERS**\n\nThe validity of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock covered by this offering circular will be passed upon by DeMint Law, PLLC.\n\n**EXPERTS**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of our company for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included in this offering circular have been audited by BF Borgers CPA, a professional corporation, as stated in this report appearing herein. Such financial statements have been so included in reliance upon the report of such firm given upon its authority as an expert in accounting and auditing.\n\n**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**\n\nWe have filed with the Commission an offering statement on Form 1-A under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Series C Preferred Stock that we are offering.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n**Going Concern Matter**\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n**Basis for Opinion**\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n**Critical Audit Matter**\n\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n\n**_/s/ BF Borgers CPA PC_**\n\n**BF Borgers CPA PC**\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020\n\nLakewood, CO\n\nApril 14, 2023\n\nF-2  \n---  \n  \n**AMERICAN REBEL HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**\n\nDecember 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021  \n---|---  \nASSETS  \nCURRENT ASSETS:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 356,754 | $| 17,607  \nAccounts receivable | 1,613,489 | 100,746  \nPrepaid expense | 207,052 | 163,492  \nInventory | 7,421,696 | 685,854  \nInventory deposits | 309,684 | -

Effective January 5, 2017, the Company amended its articles of incorporation and changed its name to American Rebel Holdings, Inc. The Company completed a business combination with its majority stockholder, American Rebel, Inc. on June 19, 2017. As a result, American Rebel, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\n\nThe acquisition of American Rebel, Inc. was accounted for as a reverse merger. The Company issued 217,763 shares of its common stock and issued warrants to purchase 6,250 shares of common stock to stockholders of American Rebel, Inc. and cancelled 112,500 shares of common stock owned by American Rebel, Inc.\n\nThe Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 14, 2015. Twenty six (26) investors invested at a price of $0.80 per share for a total of $60,000 and closed on December 11, 2015. On July 29, 2022, the Company closed on the acquisition of the Champion Entities.\n\n_Nature of operations_\n\nThe Company develops and sells branded products in the self-defense, safe storage and patriotic product areas that are promoted and sold using a wholesale distribution network, personal appearance, music, Internet and television avenues. The Company’s products are marketed under the American Rebel Brand and imprinted with such branding. Through its recent acquisition of the “Champion Entities” (which consists of Champion Safe Co., Inc., Superior Safe, LLC, Safe Guard Security Products, LLC, and Champion Safe De Mexico, S.A. de C.V.) the Company promotes and sells its products through a growing network of dealers, in select regional retailers and local specialty safe, sporting goods, hunting and firearms stores, as well as through a multitude of online avenues, including its website and various e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com.\n\n_Principles of Consolidation_\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries, American Rebel, Inc., and the Champion Entities. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n_Cash and cash equivalents_\n\nFor the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximate fair value.\n\n_Inventory and Inventory Deposits_\n\nInventory consists of safes, backpacks, jackets and accessories manufactured to our design and held for resale and are carried at the lower of cost (First-in, First-out Method) or net realizable value. The Company determines the estimate for the adjustment for slow moving or obsolete inventories by regularly evaluating individual inventory levels, projected sales, and current economic conditions. The Company also makes deposit payments on inventory to be manufactured that are carried separately until the goods are received into inventory.\n\nF-7  \n---  \n  \n_Fixed assets and depreciation_\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Additions and improvements are capitalized while ordinary maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is recorded by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which ranges from five to seven years.\n\n_Revenue recognition_\n\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: _1) Identify the contract with a client; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) Recognize revenues when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation._\n\nThese steps are met when an order is received, a price agreed, and the product shipped or delivered to that customer.\n\n_Advertising costs_\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred; Marketing costs incurred were $507,503 and $171,030 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n_Fair value of financial instruments_\n\nFair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair value. These financial instruments include cash, and accounts payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short-term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand.\n\nLevel 1: The preferred inputs to valuation efforts are “quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,” with the caveat that the reporting entity must have access to that market. Information at this level is based on direct observations of transactions involving the same assets and liabilities, not assumptions, and thus offers superior reliability. However, relatively few items, especially physical assets, actually trade in active markets.\n\nLevel 2: The FASB acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and liabilities are relatively uncommon and, even when they do exist, they may be too thin to provide reliable information. To deal with this shortage of direct data, the board provided a second level of inputs that can be applied in three situations.\n\nLevel 3: If inputs from levels 1 and 2 are not available, FASB acknowledges that fair value measures of many assets and liabilities are less precise. The board describes Level 3 inputs as “unobservable,” and limits their use by saying they “shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.” This category allows “for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date”. Earlier in the standard, FASB explains that “observable inputs” are gathered from sources other than the reporting company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by market participants.\n\n_Stock-based compensation_\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 505 and 718 which requires the Company to recognize expense related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award.\n\nF-8  \n---  \n  \nThe Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with ASC 718-10 and the conclusions reached by ASC 505-50. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by FASB ASC 505-50.\n\n_Earnings per share_\n\nNet loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined by ASC 260 - Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. Dilutive common share equivalents are negligible or immaterial as dilutive shares to be issued during net loss years were non-existent. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net loss per share was $(0.96) and $(4.85), respectively.\n\nFully diluted shares outstanding is the total number of shares that the Company would theoretically have if all dilutive securities were exercised and converted into shares. Dilutive securities include options, warrants, convertible debt, preferred stock and anything else that can be converted into shares. Potential dilutive shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of dilutive securities, calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes out-of-the-money options (i.e., such options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares for the period) because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Out-of-the-money stock options totaled none and none as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. All other dilutive securities are listed below.\n\nThe following table illustrates the total number of common shares that would be converted from common stock equivalents issued and outstanding at the end of each period presented; as of December 31, 2022 and as of December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nDecember 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021  \n---|---  \nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share for the year ended | 7,469,000 | 1,258,000  \nTotal dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards or common stock equivalents | 16,864,000 | 682,000  \nShares used in computation of fully diluted earnings per share for the year ended | 24,333,000 | 1,940,000  \nNet income (loss) | $| (7,143,153| ) | $| (6,098,944| )  \nFully diluted income (loss) per share | $| (0.29| ) | $| (3.14| )  \n  \nIn periods of losses, diluted loss per share is computed on the same basis as basic loss per share as the inclusion of any other potential shares outstanding would be anti-dilutive.\n\n_Income taxes_\n\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 740 for recording provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is based on the changes in the asset or liability for each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income tax in the period of change.\n\nF-9  \n---  \n  \nDeferred income tax may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current, depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.\n\nThe Company applies a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. ASC Topic 740 only allows the recognition of tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company reviewed its tax positions and determined there were no outstanding, or retroactive tax positions with less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, therefore this standard has not had a material effect on the Company.\n\nThe Company does not anticipate any significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.\n\nThe Company classifies tax-related penalties and net interest as income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, no income tax expense has been recorded.\n\n_Use of estimates_\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\n_Warranties_\n\nThe Company’s safe manufacturing business estimates their exposure to warranty claims based on both current and historical (Champion Entities) product sales data and warranty costs (actual) incurred. The Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability quarterly and adjusts the amount as necessary. Warranty liability is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We estimate that warranty liability is nominal or negligible based on the quality of products and our excellent customer relationships. Warranty liability is $93,458 as of December 31, 2022. We had no warranty liability as of December 31, 2021.\n\n_Business Combinations_\n\nThe Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, and as further defined by ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805), which requires the purchase price to be measured at fair value. When the purchase consideration consists entirely of shares of our common stock, the Company calculates the purchase price by determining the fair value, as of the acquisition date, of shares issued in connection with the closing of the acquisition and, if the transaction involves contingent consideration based on achievement of milestones or earn-out events, the probability-weighted fair value, as of the acquisition date, of shares issuable upon the occurrence of future events or conditions pursuant to the terms of the agreement governing the business combination. If the transaction involves such contingent consideration, our calculation of the purchase price involves probability inputs that are highly judgmental due to the inherent unpredictability of drug development, particularly by development-stage companies. The Company recognizes estimated fair values of the tangible assets and intangible assets acquired, including in process research and development (“IPR&D”), and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, and we record as goodwill any amount of the purchase price of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in excess of the fair value (see Note 8 - Goodwill and Acquisition Of Champion Entities and Note 15 - Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information (Unaudited) for further information in accordance with ASC 805-10-55-37 through ASC 805-10-55-50).\n\nF-10  \n---  \n  \n_Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities_\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The standard requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on the balance sheet as a Right-of-Use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability and requires leases to be classified as either an operating or a finance type lease. The standard excludes leases of intangible assets or inventory. The standard became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach, by applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. Results and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under ASC 840. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the standard, which also allowed the Company to carry forward historical lease classifications. The Company also elected the practical expedient related to treating lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all equipment leases as well as electing a policy exclusion permitting leases with an original lease term of less than one year to be excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nUnder ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The Company’ lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.\n\nOperating leases are included in operating lease Right-of-Use assets and operating lease liabilities, current and non-current, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\n\n_Recent pronouncements_\n\nThe Company evaluated recent accounting pronouncements through December 31, 2022, and believes that none have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\n_Concentration Risk_\n\nIn 2022 prior to the closing of the Champion Entities, the Company purchased a substantial portion (over 20%) of inventory from two third-party vendors. With the closing of the Champion Entities, the Company no longer purchases a substantial portion (over 20%) of its inventory from these specific third-party vendors. As of December 31, 2022, the net amount due to these specific third-party vendors (accounts payable and accrued expense) was $0. Similarly, as of December 31, 2021, the net amount due to these specific third-party vendors (accounts payable and accrued expenses) was also $0. The loss of manufacturing vendor relationships could have a material effect on the Company, however the Company believes numerous other suppliers that could be substituted should these specific third-party vendors/suppliers become unavailable or non-competitive.\n\n**NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN**\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As noted above, the Company is in the growth and acquisition stage and, accordingly, has not yet reached profitability from its operations (which now includes the Champion Entities business). Since inception, the Company has been engaged in financing activities and executing its plan of operations and incurring costs and expenses related to product development, branding, inventory buildup and product launch. As a result, the Company has continued to incur significant net losses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounting to ($7,143,153) and ($6,098,944), respectively. The Company’s accumulated deficit was ($34,112,810) as of December 31, 2022 and ($26,969,657) as of December 31, 2021. The Company’s working capital surplus was $6,678,562 as of December 31, 2022 compared to a working capital deficit of ($4,171,277) as of December 31, 2021. The increase in working capital from December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022, is due primarily to the Company closing on its registered public offering in February 2022 its July 2022 private investment in public equity (“PIPE”) transaction and its acquisition and integration of the Champion Entities. Until most recently the Company’s activities have been primarily sustained through equity/debt financing and the continued usage of deferral of payments on accounts payable and other expenses.\n\nF-11  \n---  \n  \nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise capital from the sale of its equity and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues.\n\nManagement believes funding can be secured through the obtaining of loans, as well as future offerings of its preferred and common stock. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will obtain this additional working capital, or if obtained, that such funding will not cause substantial dilution to its existing stockholders. If the Company is unable to secure such additional funds from these sources, it may be forced to change or delay some of its business objectives and efforts. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThese financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n**NOTE 3- INVENTORY AND DEPOSITS**\n\nInventory and deposits include the following:\n\nDecember 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021  \n---|---  \nInventory - Finished goods | $| 7,421,696 | $| 685,854  \nInventory – Deposits and other | 309,684 | -  \nTotal Inventory | $| 7,731,380 | $| 685,854  \n  \nWith the Champion acquisition we will soon eliminate the need to hold inventory with our American Rebel, Inc subsidiary at its facility. We do not believe we have a risk of concentration in our purchasing of inventory materials, sourcing needs or manufacturing. The Champion acquisition added approximately $5,400,000 in inventory on the date of purchase less intercompany deposits of approximately $600,000. We have added approximately $1,600,000 in new inventory purchases over the past 5 months and 3 days, enabling us to take advantage of pricing discounts.\n\n**NOTE 4 – PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nProperty and equipment include the following:  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021  \nPlant, property and equipment | $| 367,317 | $| 32,261  \nVehicles | 448,542 | 277,886  \nProperty and equipment gross | 815,859 | 310,147  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation | (359,334| ) | (309,247| )  \nNet property and equipment | $| 456,525 | $| 900  \n  \nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 we recognized $50,087 and $3,643 in depreciation expense, respectively. We depreciate these assets over a period of sixty (60) months which has been deemed their useful life. We recognized 5 months and 3 days of depreciation expense from the assets that we acquired with the Champion acquisition. The Champion acquisition added approximately $400,000 in assets on the date of the purchase.\n\nF-12  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 5 –RELATED PARTY NOTE PAYABLE AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company received loans from its sole officer and director at the time totaling $221,155. Balances outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2021 were paid in full during 2021.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company acquired three vehicles from various related parties and assumed the debt secured by each one of the vehicles. Accordingly, the recorded value for each vehicle is the total debt assumed under each related loan, or a total of $277,886. All of the loans associated with these transactions were paid in full as of December 31, 2022.\n\nCharles A. Ross, Jr. serves as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and director. Compensation for Mr. Ross was $681,400 and $200,000 plus stock awards of $20,766 and $393,490, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Doug E.

The notes were secured by a pledge of certain of the Company’s current inventory and the chief executive officer’s personal guaranty. These short-term working capital notes mature in 30-180 days. In connection with these notes, the Company issued 546,292 shares of its common stock, warrants to purchase 662,713 shares of its common stock. The fair value of these share incentives was calculated to be $1,437,432. The fair value of the share incentive was recorded as a discount to the note payable and the discount was amortized over the term of those agreements to interest expense using the straight-line method that approximates the effective interest method. Interest expense recorded as a result of amortization of discount for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,261,695.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company and the Company’s wholly-owned operating subsidiary completed the conversion of short term notes with a face value of $1,713,904 and accrued interest into 96,336 shares of common stock with a fair value of $2,691,940, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $725,723 recorded in our consolidated statement of operations.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company through one of its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries completed the sale of several short-term notes under similar terms totaling $60,000. The notes are secured by a pledge of certain items of the Company’s current inventory and the chief executive officer’s personal guaranty.\n\nF-13  \n---  \n  \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company and one of its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries repaid $2,541,634 of these short-term notes and completed the conversion of short-term notes with a face value of $1,950,224 and accrued interest into shares of common stock with a fair value of $2,803,632, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1,376,756 recorded in our consolidated statement of operations. The conversion of a substantial portion of the outstanding short-term notes payable and accrued interest was accomplished and in conjunction with the Company’s public offering completed in February of 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the outstanding balance due on the working capital notes was $602,643 and $3,879,428, respectively.\n\n**NOTE 8 – GOODWILL AND ACQUISITION OF CHAMPION ENTITIES**\n\n_Goodwill_\n\nGoodwill is initially recorded as of the acquisition date, and is measured as any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to impairment testing annually (on the first day of the fourth quarter), or between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. We first perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate goodwill for potential impairment. If based on that assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value, a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The quantitative impairment test requires determining the fair value of the reporting unit. We use the income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant estimates and assumptions about the future such as sales growth, gross margins, employment costs, capital expenditures, inflation and future economic and market conditions. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, impairment is recorded for the excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had goodwill of $4,200,000 and none, respectively, presented within other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets, primarily related to our 2022 acquisition of Champion Entities. In the 4th quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value. Accordingly, no further impairment testing of goodwill was performed, and we did not recognize any goodwill impairment for the 4th quarter or for the year ending December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company will review its goodwill for impairment periodically (based on economic conditions) and more specifically in the 4th quarter of its financial reporting year and determine whether impairment is to be recognized within its consolidated statement of operations. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for more information on the impairment testing.\n\n_Business Combination Consideration_\n\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company entered into a stock and membership interest purchase agreement with Champion Safe Co., Inc., Superior Safe, LLC, Safe Guard Security Products, LLC, Champion Safe De Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (the “Champion Entities” or “Champion”) and Mr. Ray Crosby (the “Seller”) (the “Champion Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and membership interests of the Champion Entities from the Seller.\n\nThe acquisition occurred on July 29, 2022. Under the terms of the Champion Purchase Agreement, the Company paid the Seller (i) cash consideration of approximately $9,150,000, along with (ii) cash deposits in the amount of $350,000, and (iii) reimbursed the Seller for approximately $400,000 of agreed upon acquisitions and equipment purchases completed by the Seller and the Champion Entities since June 30, 2021. In addition to the payments to the Seller, the Company paid costs on behalf of and specifically associated with the acquisition of Champion and its integration into the Company’s operations of $350,000; $200,000 was paid to our investment banker in analyzing the acquisition and purchase of Champion prior to the purchase and subsequent financing in July as well as $150,000 paid to Champion’s independent PCAOB registered accounting firm to conduct their two years of audit and subsequent interim review reports.\n\nF-14  \n---  \n  \n_Accounting for the Business Combination_\n\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities are recognized based on their estimated fair values as of the business combination closing date. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and based on estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2022 and have been prepared to illustrate the estimated effect of the business combination (see Note 15 – Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information (Unaudited).\n\nThe Company may recognize a deferred tax benefit as a result of the acquisition. Due to the acquisition, a temporary difference between the book and the tax basis for the intangible assets acquired may be created resulting in a deferred tax liability and additional goodwill. No deferred tax benefit was recorded in the combined pro forma financial statements.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805. As such, the total purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of July 29, 2022. The purchase price allocation is dependent upon certain valuation and other studies that have not yet been completed. Accordingly, the pro forma purchase price allocation is subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses and final valuations are conducted following the completion of the business combination. There can be no assurances that these additional analyses and final valuations will not result in significant changes to the estimates of fair value set forth below.\n\nThe following is the preliminary estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and ensuing goodwill identified, reconciled to the purchase price transferred:\n\nCash | $| -  \n---|---|---  \nAccounts receivable | 1,337,130  \nInventory | 5,229,426  \nFixed assets | 473,326  \nDeposits and other assets | 53,977  \nCustomer list and other intangibles** | 637,515  \nAccounts payable | (1,609,657| )  \nAccrued expenses and other | (84,297| )  \nGoodwill | 4,200,000  \nConsideration | $| 10,237,420  \nConsideration:  \nPayments of cash direct to Seller | $| 8,455,177  \nDebt payments on behalf of Seller - guarantor | 1,442,243  \nPayments to various service providers | 340,000  \n$| 10,237,420  \n  \nThe Company’s preliminary estimates of fair values of the net assets acquired are based solely on the information that was available at the date of the acquisition, and the Company is continuing to evaluate the underlying inputs and assumptions used in its valuations. Accordingly, these preliminary estimates are subject to change during the measurement period, which is up to one year from the date of the acquisition. (**- Customer list and other intangibles are combined with goodwill at the end of each period and evaluated as to fair value. At December 31, 2022 it was determined that total intangible assets (which includes goodwill) has a fair value of $4.2 million).\n\n**NOTE 9 – INCOME TAXES**\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward of $34,112,810 and $26,969,657, respectively, which begins to expire in 2034.\n\nF-15  \n---  \n  \nComponents of net deferred tax asset, including a valuation allowance, are as follows:\n\nDecember 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021  \n---|---  \nDeferred tax asset:  \nNet operating loss carryforward | $| 7,163,690 | $| 5,663,628  \nTotal deferred tax asset | 7,163,690 | 5,663,628  \nLess: Valuation allowance | (7,163,690| ) | (5,663,628| )  \nNet deferred tax asset | $| - | $| -  \n  \nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $7,163,690 and $5,663,628, respectively. In assessing the recovery of the deferred tax asset, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result, management determined it was more likely than not deferred tax assets will not be realized as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and recognized 100% valuation allowance for each period.\n\nReconciliation between statutory rate and the effective tax rate for and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\nFederal statutory rate | (21.0 | )%  \n---|---|---  \nState taxes, net of federal benefit | (0.00 | )%  \nChange in valuation allowance | 21.0 | %  \nEffective tax rate | 0.0 | %  \n  \n**NOTE 10 – SHARE CAPITAL**\n\nThe Company is authorized to issue 600,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock and 10,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value preferred stock.\n\n_Common and Preferred stock_\n\nFor the month of January 2021 the following transactions occurred: On January 5, 2021, the Company issued 3,875 shares of common stock of the Company valued at $4.80 per share as an interest payment on an outstanding note payable.

As of December 31, 2021, there were 701,776 warrants issued and outstanding to acquire additional shares of common stock.\n\nThe Company evaluates outstanding warrants as derivative liabilities and will recognize any changes in the fair value through earnings. The Company determined that the Warrants have an immaterial fair value at December 31, 2022. The warrants do not trade in a highly active securities market, and as such, the Company estimated the fair value of these common stock equivalents using Black-Scholes and the following assumptions:\n\nExpected volatility was based primarily on historical volatility. Historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods. The Company believes this method produced an estimate that was representative of the Company’s expectations of future volatility over the expected term which due to their maturity period as expiry, it was three years. The Company had no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these common stock equivalents was likely to differ materially from historical volatility. Expected life was based on three years due to the expiry of maturity. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury rate that corresponded to the expected term of the common stock equivalents.\n\nDecember 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021  \n---|---  \nStock Price | $| 0.19 | $| 5.68  \nExercise Price | $| 0.86 | $| 8.00  \nTerm (expected in years) | 4.5 | 3.2  \nVolatility | 38.14| % | 203.44| %  \nAnnual Rate of Dividends | 0.0| % | 0.0| %  \nRisk-Free Rate | 4.69| % | 1.52| %  \n  \nF-19  \n---  \n  \nStock Purchase Warrants\n\nThe following table summarizes all warrant activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nShares | Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share | Remaining term | Intrinsic value  \n---|---|---|---  \nOutstanding and Exercisable at December 31, 2020 | 43,688 | $| 20.80 | 3.48 years | -  \nGranted | 662,713 | $| 8.00 | 2.95 years | -  \nExercised | - | - | - | -  \nExpired | (4,625| ) | - | - |  -  \nOutstanding and Exercisable at December 31, 2021 | 701,776 | $| 8.80 | 2.95 years | -  \nGranted | 2,909,639 | $| 5.1875 | 5.00 years | -  \nGranted in Debt Conversion | 377,484 | $| 5.1875 | 5.00 years  \nGranted Prefunded Warrants | 11,579,885 | $| 0.01 | 5.00 years  \nGranted in PIPE transaction | 23,423,424 | $| 0.86 | 5.00 years  \nExercised | (11,579,885| ) | $| 0.01 | - | -  \nExpired | (938| ) | - | - | -  \nOutstanding and Exercisable at December 31, 2022 | 27,411,385 | $| 1.22 | 4.50 years | -  \n  \n**NOTE 12 – LEASES AND LEASED PREMISES**\n\n_Rental Payments under Non-cancellable Operating Leases and Equipment Leases_\n\nThe Company through its purchase of Champion acquired several long term (more than month-to-month) leases for two manufacturing facilities, three office spaces, five distribution centers and five retail spaces. Four of its distribution centers also have retail operations for which it leases facilities. Lease terms on the various spaces expiry from a month-to-month lease (30 days) to a long-term lease expiring in March of 2027.\n\nRent expense for operating leases totaled approximately $502,421 and $179,589 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe Company does not have any equipment leases whereby we finance this equipment needed for operations at competitive finance rates. New equipment to be financed in the near term, if necessary, may not be obtainable at competitive pricing with increasing interest rates.\n\nRental equipment expense for finance leases totaled approximately none and none for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n\nF-20  \n---  \n  \n_Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities_\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The standard requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on the balance sheet as a Right-of-Use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability and requires leases to be classified as either an operating or a finance type lease. The standard excludes leases of intangible assets or inventory. The standard became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach, by applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. Results and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019, are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under ASC 840. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the standard, which also allowed the Company to carry forward historical lease classifications. The Company also elected the practical expedient related to treating lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all equipment leases as well as electing a policy exclusion permitting leases with an original lease term of less than one year to be excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nUnder ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The Company’ lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842 which increases transparency and comparability by recognizing a lessee’s rights and obligations resulting from leases by recording them on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities. ASC 842 requires the recognition of the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and related operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company adopted the new guidance using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded on January 1, 2019.\n\nThe adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of ROU assets of $none and lease liabilities for operating leases of $none on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019, with no material impact to its consolidated statements of operations. The difference between the ROU assets and the operating lease liability represents the reclassification of (i) deferred rent balances, resulting from the historical operating leases, and (ii) certain accrued restructuring liabilities. The Company’s accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged from its accounting for capital leases in prior periods.\n\nThe Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted within the standard, which allow an entity to forgo reassessing (i) whether a contract contains a lease, (ii) classification of leases, and (iii) whether capitalized costs associated with a lease meet the definition of initial direct costs. Also, the Company elected the expedient allowing an entity to use hindsight to determine the lease term and impairment of ROU assets and the expedient related to land easements which allows the Company not to retrospectively treat land easements as leases; however, the Company must apply lease accounting prospectively to land easements if they meet the definition of a lease.\n\nFor contracts entered into on or after the effective date, at the inception of a contract the Company will assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtained the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. Leases entered into prior to January 1, 2019, are accounted for under ASC 840 and were not reassessed for classification.\n\nFor operating leases, the lease liability is initially and subsequently measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments. For finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured in the same manner and date as for operating leases, and is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases, unless an interest rate is implicitly stated in the lease. The lease term for all of the Company’s leases includes the noncancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend the lease controlled by the lessor. All ROU assets are reviewed for impairment.\n\nF-21  \n---  \n  \nLease expense for operating leases consists of the lease payments plus any initial direct costs, net of lease incentives, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the asset on a straight-line basis over the earlier of the lease term or its useful life and interest expense determined on an amortized cost basis. The lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.\n\nThe Company’s operating leases are comprised primarily of a facility lease and we have no finance leases for our vehicles or equipment. \n\nBalance sheet information related to our leases is presented below:\n\nSCHEDULE OF BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION RELATED TO LEASES\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \nBalance Sheet location | 2022 | 2021  \nOperating leases:  \nRight-of-use lease assets | Right-of-use operating lease assets | $| 1,977,329 | $| -  \nRight-of-use lease liability, current | Other current liabilities | 992,496 | -  \nRight-of-use lease liability, long-term | Right-of-use operating lease liability | 984,833 | -  \nFinance leases:  \nRight-of-use lease assets | Property, plant and equipment | - | -  \nRight-of-use lease liability, current | Current portion of long-term debt | - | -  \nRight-of-use lease liability, long-term | Long-term debt | - | -  \n  \nThe following provides details of the Company’s lease expense:\n\nYears Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2022 | 2021  \nOperating lease expense, net | $| 502,421 | $| -  \nFinance lease expense:  \nAmortization of assets | - | -  \nInterest on lease liabilities | - | -  \nTotal finance lease expense | - | -  \nOperating lease expense, net | $| 502,421 | $| -  \n  \nOther information related to leases is presented below:\n\nSCHEDULE OF OTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO LEASES\n\n2022 | 2021  \n---|---  \nRight-of-use assets acquired in exchange for operating lease obligations | $| 1,977,329 | $| -  \nCash Paid For Amounts Included In Measurement of Liabilities:  \nOperating cash flows from finance leases | - | -  \nOperating cash flows from operating leases | 1,038,647 | -  \nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term:  \nOperating leases | 3.0 years | 0.0 years  \nFinance leases | 0.0 years | 0.0 years  \nWeighted Average Discount Rate:  \nOperating leases | 5.00| % | 5.00| %  \nFinance leases | n/a | % | n/a | %  \n  \nF-22  \n---  \n  \nThe minimum future annual payments under non-cancellable leases during the next five years and thereafter, at rates now in force, are as follows:\n\nFinance leases | Operating leases  \n---|---  \n2023 | $| - | $| 1,106,358  \n2024 | - | 688,526  \n2025 | - | 163,794  \n2026 | - | 62,792  \n2027 | - | 3,733  \nThereafter | - | -  \nTotal future minimum lease payments, undiscounted | - | 2,025,203  \nLess: Imputed interest | (-) | (104,664| )  \nPresent value of future minimum lease payments | $| - | $| 1,920,539  \n  \nRent costs totaled approximately $502,421 and $179,589 for years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n**NOTE 13 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\n_Legal Proceedings_\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, various claims and lawsuits, incidental to the ordinary course of our business, may be brought against the Company. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, resolution of any of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\n_Contractual Obligations_\n\nThe Company does not believe there are any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the Company. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 there was approximately none and none, respectively, in outstanding letters of credit issued in the normal course of business. These letters of credit would reduce our available borrowings, if we had any. The Company subsequent to year end entered into a line of credit with a major financial institution (see Note – 14 - Subsequent Events).\n\n_Executive Employment Agreements and Independent Contractor Agreements_\n\nThe Company has written employment agreements with its Chief Executive Officer and various other executive officers. All payments made to its executive officers and other service providers are analyzed and determined by the board of directors compensation committee; some payments made to independent contractors (or officer payments as non-employee compensation) may be subject to backup withholding or the general withholding of payroll taxes which may make the Company responsible for the withholding of those taxes. Certain service providers are responsible for their own withholding and payment of taxes. Certain state taxing authorities may otherwise disagree with that analysis.\n\n**NOTE 14 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nThe Company evaluated all events that occurred after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2022 through the date the financial statements were issued and determined that there were the following subsequent events.\n\nOn February 10, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary Champion Safe Company secured a line of credit with Bank of America which provides up to $2,000,000 in additional funding secured by Champion Safe Company’s inventory and account receivables.\n\nF-23  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 15 – PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)**\n\n_Introduction_\n\nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presents the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations based upon the combined historical financial statements of American Rebel Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) and Champion Safe Co., Inc., Superior Safe, LLC, Safe Guard Security Products, LLC, Champion Safe De Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (collectively “Champion Entities”), after giving effect to the consummation of the transaction completed on July 29, 2022 (as disclosed on Current Report Form 8-K, dated August 4, 2022), by and among the Company and Champion Entities, and the related adjustments described in the accompanying notes. The transaction is accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires determination of the accounting acquirer.\n\nThe Company is considered to be the acquirer of Champion Entities for accounting purposes and will allocate the purchase price to the fair value of Champion Entities’ assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet data as of December 31, 2022, gives effect to the transaction as if it occurred on that date for which it is reported on, which incidentally the Company acquired Champion Entities on July 29, 2022. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, gives effect to the transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 2021, more than one full calendar year prior to the actual acquisition date of July 29, 2022.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflecting the transaction have been prepared in accordance with business combination accounting guidance as provided in FASB ASC Topic 805 and reflect the preliminary allocation of the estimated merger consideration to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values, using the assumptions set forth in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. The Company’s historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information to give pro forma effect to events that are (1) directly attributable to the transaction, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the statement of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the transaction had been completed as of the dates set forth above, nor is it indicative of the future results or financial position of the combined company. In connection with the pro forma condensed combined financial information, the Company allocated the estimated purchase price using its best estimates of fair value. The allocation is dependent upon certain valuation and other analyses that are not yet final. Accordingly, the pro forma acquisition price adjustments are preliminary and subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. There can be no assurances that the final valuations will not result in material changes to the preliminary estimated purchase price allocation. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also does not give effect to the dilution or costs of financing associated with the transaction, potential impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the transaction or any integration costs. Furthermore, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not include certain nonrecurring charges and the related tax effects that result directly from the transaction as described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with both the Company’s and Champion Entities’ unaudited historical condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, (which includes the Champion Entities activities as of the acquisition date and financial activity through the end of the 2022 calendar year) and the audited historical consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nF-24  \n---  \n  \n**AMERICAN REBEL HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**UNAUDITED COMBINED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**\n\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc | Champion Acquisition | Purchase Transaction Accounting | Financing Transaction Accounting | Pro Forma  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nHistorical | Historical | Adjustments | Adjustments | Combined  \n31-Dec-22 | 31-Dec-22 | 31-Dec-22 | 31-Dec-22 | 31-Dec-22  \n(unaudited) | (unaudited) | (unaudited) | (unaudited) | (unaudited)  \nASSETS  \nCURRENT ASSETS:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 85,339 | $| 271,415 | $| -

The final determination of the purchase price allocation was based on the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date the transaction closed, which was July 29, 2022.\n\nThe Company’s and Champion Entities’ historical results reflect the audited condensed statements of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and the audited condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\n\nF-27  \n---  \n  \n_Description of Transaction_\n\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company entered into and executed a stock and membership interest purchase agreement with Champion Safe Co., Inc., Superior Safe, LLC, Safe Guard Security Products, LLC, Champion Safe De Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (the “Champion Entities”) and Mr. Ray Crosby (“Seller”) (the “Champion Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and membership interests of Champion Entities from the Seller.\n\nUnder the terms of the Champion Purchase Agreement, the Company paid the Seller (i) cash consideration of approximately $9,150,000, along with (ii) previously provided cash deposits in the amount of $350,000, and (iii) reimbursed Seller for approximately $397,000 of agreed upon acquisitions and equipment purchases which were completed by the Seller through Champion Entities since June 30, 2021. Of total cash consideration paid to the Seller, the Seller commensurate with the closing retired a line of credit held by Champion Entities of approximately $1,442,000 and approximately $291,000 in related party loans due to the Seller by Champion Entities. All were recorded on Champion Entities books and recorded prior to July 29, 2022, the closing date.\n\n_Reclassification Adjustments_\n\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information are those as set out in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. With the information currently available, the Company determined that no significant adjustments are necessary to conform Champion Entities’ consolidated financial statements to the accounting policies used by the Company. The Company determined that the Right-to-Use assets and liabilities of the Champion Acquisition provided a net, net effect of zero to its financial presentation and condition, therefore leaving out of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe reclassification adjustments are based on currently available information and assumptions management believes are, under the circumstances and given the information available, reasonable, and reflective of any adjustments necessary to report the Company’s financial condition and results of operations as if the acquisition were completed in the presentation.\n\nThe combined company finalized the review of all accounting policies and reclassifications, which were not deemed to be materially different from the amounts set forth in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presented herein. The reclassification adjustments for proforma presentation currently identified are as follows:\n\n_Transaction Consideration_\n\nTotal transaction consideration was approximately $9,900,000 as determined through the actual purchase price of $9,897,420 as described above in Note 2 to this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\n\nThe following table summarizes the consideration transferred as a result of the combination.\n\nDeposits paid with contract | $| 350,000  \n---|---|---  \nCash payment due at closing | 9,150,000  \nReimbursement for equipment purchased since June 30, 2021 | 400,000  \nTransaction Consideration | $| 9,900,000  \n  \nTotal additional costs directly attributed to the purchase of the Champion Entities was and additional $340,000 as determined through various expenditures or costs that the Company incurred in completing the transaction with the Champion Entities. Those costs were approximately $200,000 paid to the Company’s investment banker for its services on the acquisition as well as approximately $150,000 in fees paid to the auditors of Champion Entities which so happen to be the Company’s auditor.\n\nF-28  \n---  \n  \n_Allocation of Consideration_\n\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed of Champion Entities are recognized and measured at fair value as of the closing date of the combination and added to those of the Company. The determination of fair value used in the transaction-related adjustments presented herein are based on management estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and have been prepared to illustrate the effect of the acquisition. The Company used the assistance of outside professionals and valuation experts to determine if there should be any impairment charges or other to these estimated numbers as of December 31, 2022. Final allocation of consideration, upon completion of the acquisition, was based on Champion’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, July 29, 2022.\n\nThe following table sets forth an allocation of the approximate consideration plus additional costs to acquire the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Champion Entities based on Champion Entities’ unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, with the estimated excess recorded to goodwill:\n\nTotal assets (approximate) | $| 7,070,000  \n---|---|---  \nTotal liabilities (approximate) | 1,730,000  \nNet acquired tangible assets | 5,340,000  \nGoodwill and other intangible assets | 4,900,000  \nAllocation of the Estimated Transaction Consideration | $| 10,240,000  \n  \n_Pro Forma Adjustments_\n\n_Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet Adjustments_\n\n**a.** | To record estimated working capital financing (of which there was none required) in addition to Transaction Consideration, as of December 31, 2022.  \n---|---  \nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc. | Champion Entities | Total  \n---|---|---  \nAdditional working capital | $| -

Effective January 5, 2017, the Company amended its articles of incorporation and changed its name to American Rebel Holdings, Inc. On June 19, 2017, the Company completed a business combination with its majority stockholder, American Rebel, Inc. As a result, American Rebel, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\n\n_Nature of operations_\n\nThe Company develops and sells branded products in the self-defense, safe storage and other patriotic product areas using a wholesale distribution network, utilizing personal appearances, musical venue performances, as well e-commerce and television. The Company’s products are marketed under the American Rebel Brand and are proudly imprinted with such branding. Through its acquisition of the “Champion Entities” (which consists of Champion Safe Co., Inc., Superior Safe, LLC, Safe Guard Security Products, LLC, and Champion Safe De Mexico, S.A. de C.V.) the Company promotes and sells its safe and storage products through a growing network of dealers, in select regional retailers and local specialty safe, sporting goods, hunting and firearms retail outlets, as well as through online avenues, including website and e-commerce platforms. The Company sells its products under the Champion Safe Co., Superior Safe Company and Safe Guard Safe Co. brands as well as the American Rebel Brand. On August 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Brewing Agreement (the “Brewing Agreement”) with Associated Brewing Company, a Minnesota limited liability company (“Associated Brewing”). Under the terms of the Brewing Agreement, Associated Brewing has been appointed as the exclusive producer and seller of American Rebel branded spirits, with the initial product being the American Rebel Light Beer (“American Rebel Beer”). American Rebel Beer plans to launch regionally in early 2024.\n\nTo varying degrees, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to affect our operating business. Significant government and private sector actions have taken place to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus and its variants. The development of geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow rapid inflation in recent years have produced varying effects on our business. The economic effects from these events over long term cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with the evaluation of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us (through accounts receivable) and the estimations of certain losses assumed under warranty and other liability contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods.\n\n_Interim Financial Statements and Basis of Presentation_\n\nThe accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information, and with the rules and regulations of the SEC set forth in Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by the U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These financial statements should be read along with the Annual Report filed on Form 10-K of the Company for the period ended December 31, 2022, and notes thereto contained, filed on April 14, 2023.\n\n_Principles of Consolidation_\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, American Rebel, Inc., and the Champion Entities. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n_Year-end_\n\nThe Company’s year-end is December 31.\n\nF-35  \n---  \n  \n_Cash and cash equivalents_\n\nFor the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value.\n\n_Inventory and Inventory Deposits_\n\nInventory consists of backpacks, jackets, safes, other storage products and accessories manufactured to our design and held for resale and are carried at the lower of cost (First-in, First-out Method) or market value. The Company determines an estimate for the reserve of slow moving or obsolete inventories by regularly evaluating individual inventory levels, projected sales and current economic conditions. The Company makes deposit payments on certain inventory to be manufactured that are carried separately until the manufactured goods are received into inventory.\n\n_Fixed assets and depreciation_\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Additions and improvements are capitalized while ordinary maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which ranges from five to seven years.\n\n_Revenue recognition_\n\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: (_1) Identify the contract with a client; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) Recognize revenues when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation._\n\nThese steps are met when an order is received, a price is agreed to, and the product is shipped or delivered to that customer.\n\n_Advertising costs_\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred; Marketing costs which we consider to be advertising costs incurred were $172,617 and $119,122 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and $942,687 and $349,341 for the nine-month period then ended, respectively.\n\n_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_\n\nFair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash, and accounts payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand.\n\nLevel 1: The preferred inputs to valuation efforts are “quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,” with the caveat that the reporting entity must have access to that market. Information at this level is based on direct observations of transactions involving the same assets and liabilities, not assumptions, and thus offers superior reliability. However, relatively few items, especially physical assets, actually trade in active markets.\n\nF-36  \n---  \n  \nLevel 2: FASB acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and liabilities are relatively uncommon and, even when they do exist, they may be too thin to provide reliable information. To deal with this shortage of direct data, the board provided a second level of inputs that can be applied in three situations.\n\nLevel 3: If inputs from levels 1 and 2 are not available, FASB acknowledges that fair value measures of many assets and liabilities are less precise. The board describes Level 3 inputs as “unobservable,” and limits their use by saying they “shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.” This category allows “for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date”. Earlier in the standard, FASB explains that “observable inputs” are gathered from sources other than the reporting company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by market participants.\n\n_Stock-based compensation_\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 505 and 718 which requires the Company to recognize expense related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award.\n\nThe Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with ASC 718-10 and the conclusions reached ASC 505-50. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by ASC 505-50.\n\n_Earnings per share_\n\nNet loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined by ASC 260 - Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. Dilutive common share equivalents are negligible or immaterial as dilutive shares to be issued during net loss years were non-existent. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, net loss per share was $(0.95) and $(8.90), respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, net loss per share was $(2.50) and $(33.62), respectively\n\nFully diluted shares outstanding is the total number of shares that the Company would theoretically have if all dilutive securities were exercised and converted into shares. Dilutive securities include options, warrants, convertible debt, preferred stock and anything else that can be converted into shares. Potential dilutive shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of dilutive securities, calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes out-of-the-money options (i.e., such options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares for the period) because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Out-of-the-money stock options totaled none and none as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. All other dilutive securities are listed below.\n\nThe following table illustrates the total number of common shares that would be converted from common stock equivalents issued and outstanding at the end of each period presented; as of September 30, 2023 and as of September 30, 2022, respectively.\n\nSeptember 30, 2023 | September 30, 2022  \n---|---  \nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share for the periods ended | 1,442,600 | 189,700  \nTotal dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards or common stock equivalents | 1,714,700 | 344,000  \nShares used in computation of fully diluted earnings per share for the periods ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively | 3,157,300 | 533,700  \nNet income (loss) | $| (3,610,929| ) | $| (6,377,731| )  \nFully diluted income (loss) per share | $| (1.14| ) | $| (11.95| )  \n  \nIn periods of losses, diluted loss per share is computed on the same basis as basic loss per share as the inclusion of any other potential shares outstanding would be anti-dilutive.\n\n_Income taxes_\n\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 740 for recording provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is based on the changes in the asset or liability for each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income tax in the period of change.\n\nDeferred income tax may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current, depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.\n\nF-37  \n---  \n  \nThe Company applies a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. ASC Topic 740 only allows the recognition of tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. As of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Company reviewed its tax positions and determined there were no outstanding, or retroactive tax positions with less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, therefore this standard has not had a material effect on the Company.\n\nThe Company does not anticipate any significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.\n\nThe Company classifies tax-related penalties and net interest as income tax expense. For the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively, no income tax expense has been recorded.\n\n_Use of estimates_\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\n_Warranties_\n\nThe Company’s safe manufacturing business estimates its exposure to warranty claims based on both current and historical (with respect to the Champion Entities) product sales data and warranty costs (actual) incurred. The Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability each quarter and adjusts the amount as necessary. Warranty liability is included in our accrued expense accounts in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets We estimate that warranty liability is nominal or negligible based on the superior quality of products and our excellent customer relationships. Warranty liability recorded as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023 was approximately $100,000.\n\n_Business Combinations_\n\nThe Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, and as further defined by ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805), which requires the purchase price to be measured at fair value. When the purchase consideration consists entirely of shares of our common stock, the Company calculates the purchase price by determining the fair value, as of the acquisition date, of shares issued in connection with the closing of the acquisition and, if the transaction involves contingent consideration based on achievement of milestones or earn-out events, the probability-weighted fair value, as of the acquisition date, of shares issuable upon the occurrence of future events or conditions pursuant to the terms of the agreement governing the business combination. If the transaction involves such contingent consideration, our calculation of the purchase price involves probability inputs that are highly judgmental due to the inherent unpredictability of future results, particularly by growth-stage companies. The Company recognizes estimated fair values of the tangible assets and intangible assets acquired, including in process research and development (“IPR&D”), and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, and we record as goodwill any amount of the purchase price of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in excess of the fair value (see Note 8 - Goodwill and Acquisition of Champion Entities for further information in accordance with ASC 805-10-55-37 through ASC 805-10-55-50).\n\n_Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities_\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The standard requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on the balance sheet as a Right-of-Use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability and requires leases to be classified as either an operating or a finance type lease. The standard excludes leases of intangible assets or inventory. The standard became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach, by applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. Results and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019, are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under ASC 840. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the standard, which also allowed the Company to carry forward historical lease classifications. The Company also elected the practical expedient related to treating lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all equipment leases as well as electing a policy exclusion permitting leases with an original lease term of less than one year to be excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nUnder ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.\n\nOperating leases are included in operating lease Right-of-Use assets and operating lease liabilities, current and non-current, on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\n_Recent pronouncements_\n\nThe Company evaluated recent accounting pronouncements through September 30, 2023, and believes that none have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\nF-38  \n---  \n  \n_Concentration risks_\n\nPrior to the closing of the Champion Entities, the Company purchased a substantial portion (over 20%) of its inventory from 2 third-party vendors. With the closing and integration of the Champion Entities, the Company no longer purchases a substantial portion (over 20%) of its inventory from the 2 third-party vendors. As of September 30, 2023, the net amount due to these 2 third-party vendors (accounts payable and accrued expense) was $0. The loss of vendor relationships could have a material effect on the Company; however, the Company believes sufficient suppliers could be substituted should these third-party vendors/suppliers become unavailable or non-competitive for us.\n\n**NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN**\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As noted above, the Company is in the growth and acquisition stage and, accordingly, has not yet reached profitability from its operations. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in financing activities and executing its business plan of operations and incurring costs and expenses related to product development, branding, inventory buildup and product launch. As a result, the Company has continued to incur net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022 of ($3,610,929) and ($6,377,731), respectively. The Company’s accumulated deficit was ($37,723,739) as of September 30, 2023, and ($34,112,810) as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s working capital was $8,111,282 as of September 30, 2023, compared to $6,678,562 as of December 31, 2022. The increase in working capital from December 31, 2022, to September 30, 2023, is due to the Company increasing its overall inventory and accounts receivable balances offset by smaller increases in liabilities as well as incurring a sizeable net loss during the nine months ending September 30, 2023.\n\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise capital from the sale of its equity and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues and profitability.\n\nManagement believes that sufficient funding can be secured through the obtaining of loans, as well as future offerings of its preferred and common stock. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will obtain this additional working capital, or if obtained, that such funding will not cause substantial dilution to its existing stockholders. If the Company is unable to secure such additional funds from these sources, it may be forced to change or delay some of its business objectives and efforts. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThese financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n**NOTE 3 – INVENTORY AND DEPOSITS**\n\nInventory and deposits include the following:\n\nSeptember 30, 2023 |  **December 31, 2022**  \n---|---  \n(unaudited) | (audited)  \nInventory – finished goods | $| 8,509,992 | $| 7,421,696  \nInventory deposits | 310,587 | 309,684  \nTotal Inventory and deposits | $| 8,820,579 | $| 7,731,380  \n  \nWith the integration of Champion, we eliminated the need to hold inventory with our American Rebel, Inc. subsidiary at its facility. We do not believe we have a risk of concentration in our purchasing of inventory materials, sourcing needs or manufacturing. As reported in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K Champion added approximately $5,400,000 in inventory on the date of purchase less intercompany deposits of approximately $600,000 which is included in our balances as of December 31, 2022.\n\n**NOTE 4 – PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nProperty and equipment include the following:\n\nSeptember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \n(unaudited) | (audited)  \nPlant, property and equipment | $| 367,317 | $| 367,317  \nVehicles | 423,515 | 448,542  \nProperty and equipment gross | 790,832 | 815,859  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation | (413,568| ) | (359,334| )  \nNet property and equipment | $| 377,264 | $| 456,525  \n  \nF-39  \n---  \n  \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022 we recognized $79,260 and $11,311 in depreciation expense, respectively. We depreciate these assets over a period of sixty (60) months which has been deemed their useful life.\n\n**NOTE 5 – RELATED PARTY NOTE PAYABLE AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\nCharles A. Ross, Jr. serves as the Company’s CEO. Compensation for Mr. Ross includes a base salary and a bonus based upon certain performance measures approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nDoug Grau serves as the Company’s President. Compensation for Mr. Grau includes a base salary and a bonus based upon certain performance measures approved by the Board of Directors. Mr. Grau lent the Company approximately $95,332, net of repayments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the loan is an unsecured non-interest-bearing demand note.\n\n**NOTE 6 – LINE OF CREDIT – FINANCIAL INSTITUTION**\n\nDuring February 2023, the Company entered into a $2 million master credit agreement (credit facility) with a major financial institution (“Line of Credit”). The Line of Credit accrues interest at a rate determined by the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (“BSBY”) Daily Floating Rate plus 2.05 percentage points (which at September 30, 2023 for the Company was 7.48%), and is secured by all the assets of the Champion Entities. The Line of Credit expires February 28, 2024. The outstanding amount due on the Line of Credit at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was, respectively.\n\nSeptember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \n(unaudited) | (audited)  \nLine of credit from a financial institution. | $| 1,689,163 | $|  -  \nTotal recorded as a current liability | $| 1,689,163 | $| -  \n  \nCurrent and long-term portion. As of September 30, 2023 the total balance due of $1,689,163 reported as current as the Line of Credit is to be repaid within one year, with subsequent drawdowns as needed by the Company. The Company paid a one-time loan fee equal to 0.1% of the Line of Credit amount available. In the likelihood of default, the default interest automatically increases to 6% over the BSBY plus an additional 2.05% rate.\n\nThe Company drew down on the Line of Credit initially in the amount of $1.7 million, with subsequent net payments and draws on the Line of Credit in the amount of approximately $10,000. The Company as of September 30, 2023 has not increased the Line of Credit amount beyond its initial drawdown and has paid interest expense of approximately $65,000 to the financial institution for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company intends to keep the Line of Credit open and in existence to enhance the profitability and working capital needs of the Champion entities and may in the future seek to expand the Line of Credit as the Company grows in size.\n\n**NOTE 7 – NOTES PAYABLE – WORKING CAPITAL**\n\nSeptember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \n(unaudited) | (audited)  \nWorking capital loan with a limited liability company domiciled in the state of Georgia. The working capital loan is demand loan and accrues interest at 12% per annum and interest only payments that are due by the 15th of month following the close of the quarter. | - | 600,000  \nWorking capital loans with an irrevocable trust established in the state of Georgia, managed and owned by the same entity as the limited liability company that previously held the $600,000 in loans made June 30, 2022. The working capital loans are demand loans and accrue interest at 12% per annum and interest only payments that are due by the last day of the quarter. The 1st loan in the amount of $150,000 is due and payable on December 31, 2023, the 2nd loan in the amount of $300,000 is due and payable on June 30, 2024. | 450,000 | -  \nWorking capital loans with a major financial institution converted from a revolving line of credit to a strict payoff loan agreement with the major financial institution. Annual interest rate approximates 22.5% per annum and consists of two revolving line of credit accounts. | - | 2,643  \nWorking capital loan agreement with a limited liability company domiciled in the state of New York. The working capital loan is secured by all the assets of the Company that is not secured by the first priority interest of the major financial institution line of credit facility as well as a personal guaranty by our CEO, Mr. Charles A Ross. The working capital loan requires payments of $20,000 each for 64 weeks on the Friday following funding. The working capital loan is due and payable on July 5, 2024 with a final payment of $20,000. | 702,972 | -  \n$| 1,152,972 | $| 602,643  \nTotal recorded as a current liability | $| 1,152,972 | $| 602,643  \n  \nOn April 14, 2023, the Company entered into a $1,000,000 Business Loan and Security Agreement (the “Secured Loan”) with an accredited investor lending source (the “Lender”). Under the Secured Loan, the Company received the loan net of fees of $20,000. The Secured Loan requires 64 weekly payments of $20,000 each, for a total repayment of $1,280,000. The Secured Loan bears interest at 41.4%. The Secured Loan is secured by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries second to a first priority lien secured the holder of the Line of Credit. Furthermore, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, provided a personal guaranty for the Secured Loan. The Secured Loan provides for a default fee of $15,000 for any late payments on the weekly payments. No prepayment of the loan is allowed as well as any default by the Company allows the Lender to take necessary actions to secure its collateral and recovery of funds. The Company was also required to pay a fee associated with the Lender and its introduction to the Company of $80,000 to be made in equity of the Company at the time the loan was entered into. The Company issued 3,721 post-reverse stock split shares, which on the date of issuance had a value of approximately $2,900. Since the number of shares had been established upon consummation of the loan but not valued or recorded on the books at the time, because of the leeway on grant date; total cost to the Company for the issuance of the 3,721 shares of common stock on the grant date was $2,900 which was recorded to interest expense and attributable to the loan.\n\nOn July 1, 2023, the Company entered into an assignment and assumption loan agreement (the “Assumption Loan”) with an accredited lender. Under the Assumption Agreement the Company agreed to pay $150,000 immediately to the holder of the $600,000 working capital loans that the Company had in place. The Assumption Agreement provided for the accredited lender, who effectively had the same management and ownership as the old working capital holders and assumed the debt instruments under the same terms and conditions and is due one year from the date of the Assumption Agreement, June 30, 2024 for one of the loans and the other loan (in the amount of $150,000) is due and payable on December 31, 2023. The Company made a one-time payment of $150,000 to the holder and was released from the prior obligations and the default status that it had been in with that holder since March 31, 2023.\n\nOn July 1, 2023 the Company received a release from the lender of the working capital loans that were in default since March 31, 2023, and the accredited lender of the new working capital loans paid the holder of the old working capital loans $450,000 which required no additional working capital outlay from the Company. The terms of the new loan are 12% per annum and interest only payments that are due by last day of the quarter based on a calendar year. This reduces the Company’s interest payments on the working capital loans (old) of $600,000 from $18,000 per quarter to just $13,500 per quarter (for quarter ending December 31, 2023) and $9,000 per quarter thereafter (for quarters ending March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024).\n\nDuring the nine months ending September 30, 2022, the Company repaid several short-term notes under similar terms as its other short-term notes totaling $60,000. The notes were secured by a pledge of certain inventory items and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer’s personal guaranty.\n\nF-40  \n---  \n  \nDuring the nine months ending September 30, 2022, the Company repaid $2,541,634 of these short-term notes and completed the conversion of short-term notes with a face value of $1,950,224 along with accrued interest into shares of common stock with a fair value of $2,803,632, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of $1,376,756. The conversion into common stock was done in connection with our registered public offering in February 2022 for which we recognized a loss on extinguishment.\n\nAt September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance due on all of the working capital notes payable was $1,152,972 and $602,643, respectively. These amounts do not include any interest payable on the various notes where interest was not paid in full per the terms of the notes.\n\n**NOTE 8 – GOODWILL AND ACQUISITION OF THE CHAMPION ENTITIES**\n\n_Goodwill_\n\nGoodwill is initially recorded as of the acquisition date and is measured as any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to impairment testing annually (on the first day of the fourth quarter), or between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. We first perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate goodwill for potential impairment. If based on that assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value, a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The quantitative impairment test requires determining the fair value of the reporting unit. We use the income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant estimates and assumptions about the future such as sales growth, gross margins, employment costs, capital expenditures, inflation and future economic and market conditions. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, impairment is recorded for the excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had goodwill of $4,525,000 and $4,200,000, respectively, presented within other long-term assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, primarily related to our 2022 acquisition of Champion Entities. During the 3rd quarter of 2023, we performed a qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value. Accordingly, no further impairment testing of goodwill was performed, and we did not recognize any goodwill impairment for the nine months ending September 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company policy is to review its goodwill for impairment periodically (based on economic conditions) and more specifically in the 4th quarter of its financial reporting year and determine whether impairment is to be recognized within its condensed consolidated statement of operations. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K, for more information on impairment testing.\n\n_Business Combination Consideration_\n\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company entered into a stock and membership interest purchase agreement with Champion Safe Co., Inc., Superior Safe, LLC, Safe Guard Security Products, LLC, Champion Safe De Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (the “Champion Entities” or “Champion”) and Mr. Ray Crosby (the “Seller”) (the “Champion Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and membership interests of the Champion Entities from the Seller.\n\nThe acquisition occurred on July 29, 2022. Under the terms of the Champion Purchase Agreement, the Company paid the Seller (i) cash consideration of approximately $9,150,000, along with (ii) cash deposits in the amount of $350,000, and (iii) reimbursed the Seller for approximately $400,000 of agreed upon acquisitions and equipment purchases completed by the Seller and the Champion Entities since June 30, 2021. In addition to the payments to the Seller, the Company paid costs specifically associated with the acquisition of Champion and its integration of $350,000; $200,000 was paid to our investment banker in analyzing the acquisition and purchase of Champion as well as we paid $150,000 to Champion’s independent PCAOB registered accounting firm to conduct a two year of audit and subsequent interim review report of their financial condition and reports.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Company received a claim for refund or right of repayment from the Seller of the Champion Entities with respect to the CARES Act tax credits income the Company received. The Company prior to September 30, 2023 settled the matter with the Seller and agreed to pay an additional $325,000 to the Seller. This amount was not offset against the CARES Act tax credit income but increased the purchase price of the Champion Entities and increased our determined Goodwill value by $325,000.\n\nF-41  \n---  \n  \n_Accounting for the Business Combination_\n\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities are recognized based on their estimated fair values as of the business combination closing date. Pro forma adjustments were preliminary and based on estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2022 which have been prepared to illustrate the estimated effect of the business combination (see Note 15 – Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information (Unaudited) to our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K).\n\nThe Company may recognize a negligible deferred tax benefit as a result of the acquisition. Due to the acquisition, a temporary difference between book and tax basis for the intangible assets acquired may result in a deferred tax liability and additional goodwill, which we believe to be negligible.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805. As such, the total purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of July 29, 2022. The purchase price allocation is dependent upon certain valuation and other studies that have not yet been completed, nor may never be completed. Accordingly, the pro forma purchase price allocation may be subject to further adjustments. There can be no assurances that additional analyses and final determination of valuations will result in a change to the estimates of fair value set forth below.\n\nThe following is the estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and ensuing goodwill identified, reconciled to the purchase price transferred:\n\nCash | $| -  \n---|---|---  \nAccounts receivable | 1,337,130  \nInventory | 5,229,426  \nFixed assets | 473,326  \nDeposits and other assets | 53,977  \nCustomer list and other intangibles** | 637,515  \nAccounts payable | (1,609,657| )  \nAccrued expenses and other | (84,297| )  \nGoodwill | 4,525,000  \nConsideration | $| 10,562,420  \nConsideration:  \nPayments of cash direct to Seller | $| 8,455,177  \nAdditional payments of cash to Seller in 2023 | 275,000  \nAmounts due on accounts payable to Seller (over the next 12 months) | 50,000  \nDebt payments on behalf of Seller - guarantor | 1,442,243  \nPayments to various service providers | 340,000  \n$| 10,562,420  \n  \nThe Company’s estimates of fair values of the net assets acquired are based on the information that was available at the date of the acquisition, and the Company may continue to evaluate the underlying inputs and assumptions used in its valuations and would be subject to change. Preliminary estimates are subject to change during the measurement period, which we have determined to be one year from the date of the acquisition, which is July 29, 2023. (**- Customer lists and other intangibles are combined with goodwill at the end of each period and evaluated as to fair value. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, it was determined that total intangible assets (which includes goodwill) had a fair value of $4.5 million and $4.2 million, respectively).\n\n**NOTE 9 – INCOME TAXES**\n\nAt September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward of $37,723,739 and $34,112,810, respectively, which begins to expire in 2034.\n\nComponents of net deferred tax asset, including a valuation allowance, are as follows:\n\nSeptember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \n(unaudited) | (audited)  \nDeferred tax asset:  \nNet operating loss carryforward | $| 7,922,000 | $| 7,163,690  \nTotal deferred tax asset | 7,922,000 | 7,163,690  \nLess: Valuation allowance | (7,922,000| ) | (7,163,690| )  \nNet deferred tax asset | $| - | $| -  \n  \nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, was $7,922,000 and $7,163,690, respectively. In assessing the recovery of the deferred tax asset, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result, management determined it was more likely than not deferred tax assets will not be realized as of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, and recognized 100% valuation allowance for each period.\n\nF-42  \n---  \n  \nReconciliation between the statutory rate and the effective tax rate for both periods and as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\nFederal statutory rate | (21.0| )%  \n---|---|---  \nState taxes, net of federal benefit | (0.0| )%  \nChange in valuation allowance | 21.0| %  \nEffective tax rate | 0.0| %  \n  \nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the 2022 act”) was signed into law. The 2022 act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on “adjusted financial statement income”, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On December 27, 2022, the IRS and Department of Treasury issued initial guidance for taxpayers subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. The guidance addresses several, but not all, issues that needed clarification. The IRS and Department of Treasury intend to release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2022 act as more guidance becomes available. We currently do not expect an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n**NOTE 10 – SHARE CAPITAL**\n\nThe Company is authorized to issue 600,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock and 10,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value preferred stock.\n\nOn June 27, 2023, the Company effectuated a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-25.

The Company determined that the warrants have an immaterial fair value at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. The warrants do not trade in a highly active securities market, and as such, the Company estimated the fair value of these common stock equivalents using Black-Scholes and the following assumptions:\n\nExpected volatility was based primarily on historical volatility. Historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods. The Company believes this method produced an estimate that was representative of the Company’s expectations of future volatility over the expected term which due to their maturity period as expiry, it was three years. The Company had no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these common stock equivalents was likely to differ materially from historical volatility.

Four of its distribution centers also have retail operations for which it leases facilities. Lease terms on the various spaces’ expiry from a month-to-month lease (30 days) to a long-term lease expiring in March of 2027.\n\nRent expense for operating leases totaled approximately $630,000 and $300,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe Company does not have any equipment leases whereby we finance this equipment needed for operations at competitive finance rates. New equipment to be financed in the near term, if necessary, may not be obtainable at competitive pricing with increasing interest rates.\n\nRental equipment expense for finance leases totaled approximately $0 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n_Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities_\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The standard requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on the balance sheet as a Right-of-Use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability and requires leases to be classified as either an operating or a finance type lease. The standard excludes leases of intangible assets or inventory. The standard became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach, by applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. Results and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019, are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under ASC 840. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the standard, which also allowed the Company to carry forward historical lease classifications. The Company also elected the practical expedient related to treating lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all equipment leases as well as electing a policy exclusion permitting leases with an original lease term of less than one year to be excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nUnder ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.\n\nF-47  \n---  \n  \nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842 which increases transparency and comparability by recognizing a lessee’s rights and obligations resulting from leases by recording them on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities. ASC 842 requires the recognition of the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and related operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company adopted the new guidance using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded on January 1, 2019.\n\nThe adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of ROU assets of $0 and lease liabilities for operating leases of $0 on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019, with no material impact to its condensed consolidated statements of operations. The difference between the ROU assets and the operating lease liability represents the reclassification of (i) deferred rent balances, resulting from the historical operating leases, and (ii) certain accrued restructuring liabilities. The Company’s accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged from its accounting for capital leases in prior periods.\n\nThe Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted within the standard, which allow an entity to forgo reassessing (i) whether a contract contains a lease, (ii) classification of leases, and (iii) whether capitalized costs associated with a lease meet the definition of initial direct costs. Also, the Company elected the expedient allowing an entity to use hindsight to determine the lease term and impairment of ROU assets and the expedient related to land easements which allows the Company not to retrospectively treat land easements as leases; however, the Company must apply lease accounting prospectively to land easements if they meet the definition of a lease.\n\nFor contracts entered into on or after the effective date, at the inception of a contract the Company will assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtained the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. Leases entered into prior to January 1, 2019, are accounted for under ASC 840 and were not reassessed for classification.\n\nFor operating leases, the lease liability is initially and subsequently measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments. For finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured in the same manner and date as for operating leases and is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases, unless an interest rate is implicitly stated in the lease. The lease term for all of the Company’s leases includes the noncancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend the lease controlled by the lessor. All ROU assets are reviewed for impairment.\n\nLease expense for operating leases consists of the lease payments plus any initial direct costs, net of lease incentives, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the asset on a straight-line basis over the earlier of the lease term or its useful life and interest expense determined on an amortized cost basis. The lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.\n\nThe Company’s operating leases are comprised primarily of facility leases and as such we have no finance leases for our vehicles or equipment currently at this time.\n\nF-48  \n---  \n  \nBalance sheet information related to our leases is presented below:\n\nBalance Sheet location | 2023 | 2022  \n---|---|---  \nSeptember 30,  \nBalance Sheet location | 2023 | 2022  \nOperating leases:  \nRight-of-use lease assets | Right-of-use operating lease assets | $| 1,237,618 | $| -  \nRight-of-use lease liability, current | Other current liabilities | 798,136 | -  \nRight-of-use lease liability, long-term | Right-of-use operating lease liability | 439,482 | -  \nFinance leases:  \nRight-of-use lease assets | Property, plant and equipment | - | -  \nRight-of-use lease liability, current | Current portion of long-term debt | - | -  \nRight-of-use lease liability, long-term | Long-term debt | - | -  \n  \nThe following provides details of the Company’s lease expense:\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n2023 | 2022  \nOperating lease expense, net | $| 632,420 | $| -  \nFinance lease expense:  \nAmortization of assets | - | -  \nInterest on lease liabilities | - | -  \nTotal finance lease expense | - | -  \nOperating lease expense, net | $| 632,420 | $| -  \n  \nOther information related to leases is presented below:\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nRight-of-use assets acquired in exchange for operating lease obligations | $| 1,237,618 | $| -  \nCash Paid for Amounts Included in Measurement of Liabilities:  \nOperating cash flows from finance leases | - | -  \nOperating cash flows from operating leases | 739,710 | -  \nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term:  \nOperating leases | 2.7 years  | 0.0 years   \nFinance leases | 0.0 years  | 0.0 years   \nWeighted Average Discount Rate:  \nOperating leases | 5.00| % | 5.00| %  \nFinance leases | n/a| % | n/a| %  \n  \nThe minimum future annual payments under non-cancellable leases during the next five years and thereafter, at rates now in force, are as follows:\n\nFinance leases | Operating leases  \n---|---  \n2023 (three months remaining) | $|  - | $| 265,965  \n2024 | - | 688,526  \n2025 | - | 163,794  \n2026 | - | 62,792  \n2027 | - | 3,733  \nThereafter | - | -  \nTotal future minimum lease payments, undiscounted | - | 1,184,810  \nLess: Imputed interest | (-| ) | (46,410| )  \nPresent value of future minimum lease payments | $| - | $| 1,138,330  \n  \nRental expense totaled approximately $630,000 and $300,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nF-49  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 13 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\n_Legal Proceedings_\n\nDuring the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, various claims and lawsuits, incidental to the ordinary course of our business, may be brought against the Company from time-to-time. In the opinion of management, and after consultation with legal counsel, resolution of any of these matters (of which there are none) is not expected to have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n_Contractual Obligations_\n\nThe Company does not believe there are any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 there was approximately $0 and $0, respectively, in outstanding letters of credit issued during the normal course of business. These letters of credit could reduce our available borrowings, if we had any. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Company entered into a line of credit with a major financial institution. The amount due on the line of credit as of September 30, 2023 was $1,689,163. The Company is in compliance with the terms and covenants.\n\n_Executive Employment Agreements and Independent Contractor Agreements_\n\nThe Company has written employment agreements with various other executive officers. All payments made to its executive officers and significant outside service providers are analyzed and determined by the board of directors’ compensation committee; some payments made to independent contractors (or officer payments characterized as non-employee compensation) may be subject to backup withholding or general withholding of payroll taxes, may make the Company responsible for the withholding and remittance of those taxes. Generally outside service providers are responsible for their own withholding and payment of taxes. Certain state taxing authorities may otherwise disagree with that analysis and Company policy.\n\n**NOTE 14 – OTHER INCOME – EMPLOYEE RETENTION CREDIT**\n\nThe Company retained the services of a tax service professional to provide the Company with the specialized tax services. The services included identifying various tax initiatives as well as specifically tasking the tax service professional in applying for and the tax filings for (tax) credits available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The Company received approximately $1,286,000 in tax credits under the CARES Act from the US Department of Treasury and paid approximately $178,500 to the service provider, netting the Company approximately $1,107,500 in credits for retaining its employees during COVID.\n\n**NOTE 15 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nThe Company evaluated all events that occurred after the balance sheet date of September 30, 2023, through the date the financial statements were issued and determined that there were the following subsequent events:\n\nOn October 31, 2023, the Company approved amending and restating the certificate of designation of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to increase the number of shares from 100,000 to 150,000 and allow for the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock under certain circumstances and vesting requirements. \n\nOn November 3, 2023, the Company’s board of directors approved the designation of a new Series C Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock (the “Series C Designation”). The rights, preferences, restrictions and other matters relating to the Series C Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) are as follows:\n\n●| The Series C Preferred Stock ranks, as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, junior to the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock and senior to its Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. The terms of the Series C Preferred Stock do not limit the Company’s ability to (i) incur indebtedness or (ii) issue additional equity securities that are equal or junior in rank to the shares of its Series C Preferred Stock as to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  \n---|---  \n●| Each share of Series C Preferred Stock has an initial stated value of $7.50, subject to appropriate adjustment in relation to certain events, such as recapitalizations, stock dividends, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the Series C Preferred Stock.  \n---|---  \n●| Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears to all holders of record on the applicable record date. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends at a per annum rate of 8.53% of the stated value (or $0.16 per share per quarter based on the liquidation preference per share); provided that upon an event of default (generally defined as the Company’s failure to pay dividends when due or to redeem shares when requested by a holder), such amount shall be increased to $0.225 per quarter, which is equivalent to the annual rate of 12% of the $7.50 liquidation preference per share. In the Company’s sole discretion, dividends may be paid in cash or in kind in the form of Common Stock equal to the closing price of Common Stock on the last day of the quarter. Dividends on each share begin accruing on, and are cumulative from, the date of issuance and regardless of whether the Board declares and pays such dividends. Dividends on shares of Series C Preferred Stock will continue to accrue even if any of the Company’s agreements prohibit the current payment of dividends or it does not have earnings.  \n---|---  \n  \nF-50  \n---  \n  \n●| Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, before any payment or distribution is made to the holders of Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock and on a  _junior_ basis with holders of Series A Preferred Stock, a liquidation preference equal to the stated value per share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not declared).  \n---|---  \n●| The Company may redeem the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or in part at any time after the fifth anniversary of the initial closing of offering selling such shares and continuing indefinitely thereafter, at the Company’s option, for cash, at $11.25 per share of Series C Preferred Stock, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.  \n---|---  \n●| Once per calendar quarter beginning any time after the fifth-year anniversary of date of issuance, a Holder of record of shares of Series C Preferred Stock may elect to cause the Company to redeem all or any portion of their shares of Series C Preferred Stock for an amount equal to $11.25 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, which amount may be settled by delivery of cash or shares of Common Stock, at the option of the holder. If the holder elects settlement in shares of Common Stock, the Company will deliver such number of shares of Common Stock equal to $11.25 per share of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to the redeemed shares, divided by $2.25 per share (subject to pro rata adjustment in connection with any stock splits, stock dividends, or similar changes to the Company’s capitalization occurring after the date of this Certificate), with any fraction rounded up to the next whole share of Common Stock. A holder making such election shall provide written notice thereof to the Company specifying the name and address of the holder, the number of shares to be redeemed and whether settlement shall be in cash or shares of Common Stock. The Company shall redeem the specified shares of Series C Preferred Stock for shares of Common Stock no later than ten (10) days, or for cash no later than 365 days, following receipt of such notice.  \n---|---  \n●| The Company is not obligated to redeem or repurchase shares of Series C Preferred Stock if it is restricted by applicable law or its articles of incorporation from making such redemption or repurchase or to the extent any such redemption or repurchase would cause or constitute a default under any borrowing agreements to which it or any of its subsidiaries are a party or otherwise bound. In addition, the Company has no obligation to redeem shares in connection with a redemption request made by a holder if it determines, as of the redemption date, that it does not have sufficient funds available to fund that redemption. In this regard, the Company will have complete discretion under the certificate of designation for the Series C Preferred Stock to determine whether it is in possession of “sufficient funds” to fund a redemption request. Redemptions will be limited to five percent (5%) of the total outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock per quarter. To the extent the Company is unable to complete redemptions it may have earlier agreed to make, the Company will complete those redemptions promptly after it becomes able to do so, with all such deferred redemptions being satisfied on a first come, first served, basis.  \n---|---  \n●| The Series C Preferred Stock has no voting rights relative to matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders (other than as required by law). The Company may not authorize or issue any class or series of equity securities ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or distributions upon liquidation (including securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such senior securities) or amend its articles of incorporation (whether by merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to materially and adversely change the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock without the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on such matter by holders of the Company’s outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, voting together as a class.  \n---|---  \n●| The Company will not be required to redeem shares of Series C Preferred Stock at any time except as otherwise described above. Accordingly, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock will remain outstanding indefinitely, unless the Company decides, at its option, to exercise its call right, or the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock exercises their put right. The shares of Series C Preferred Stock will not be subject to any sinking fund.  \n---|---  \n●| Each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be convertible into shares of Common Stock at a price per share of $1.50 (1 share of Series C Preferred Stock converts into 5 shares of Common Stock), at the option of the holder thereof, at any time following the issuance date of such share of Series C Preferred Stock and on or prior to the fifth (5th) day prior to a redemption date, if any, as may have been fixed in any redemption notice with respect to the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, at the Company’s office or any transfer agent for such stock.  \n---|---  \n  \nF-51  \n---\n"

Non-employee directors are entitled to receive compensation of $60,000 per year for their service, payable in restricted shares of the Company’s Common\nStock at a price determined by the average monthly closing price for each month in service, and are to be paid nominal cash fees and reimbursement of costs for\ndirector and committee meetings.\n14\nThe following table sets forth summary compensation information for the year ended December 31, 2022 for each of our non-employee directors.\nFees\nEarned or Stock Option All Other\nPaid in Cash Awards Awards Compensation Total\nName $ $ $ $ $\nCorey Lambrecht $ 63,000 $ 54,194(1) $ - $ 122,000 $ 239,194\nMichael Dean Smith $ - $ 54,194(1) $ - $ - $ 54,194\nKen Yonika(2) $ 30,500 $ 54,194(1) $ - $ - $ 84,694\n(1) Effective February 7, 2022, our non-employee directors were eligible for the payment of $60,000 per year as a non-employee director fee for their services,\nwhich is payable in shares of our Common Stock. The value is pro-rated for the partial year ended December 31, 2022. Each non-employee director was issued\n3,920 shares of Common Stock for their services for fiscal 2022.\n(2) Effective April 4, 2023, Mr. Yonika resigned from the board and its committees.\nACTION 2. APPROVAL OF REVERSE STOCK SPLIT\nThe Board recommended and the Voting Stockholders approved an amendment to American Rebel’s Articles of Incorporation to effectuate a Reverse Stock\nSplit at an exchange ratio of up to one-for-10 (or more plainly stated, up to every ten existing shares would be exchanged for one new share) as the Board may\ndetermine.\nThe Reverse Stock Split will have no effect on the par value of American Rebel’s Common Stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the\nReverse Stock Split. The proposed form of amendment to American Rebel’s Articles of Incorporation to implement the Reverse Stock Split is attached to this\nInformation Statement as Appendix A.\nAmerican Rebel’s Common Stock is currently quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AREB”.\nThe Board may elect not to implement the approved Reverse Stock Split at its sole discretion. The Board has the maximum flexibility to react to current\nmarket conditions and to therefore achieve the purposes of the Reverse Stock Split, if implemented, and to act in the best interests of American Rebel and its\nstockholders.\nAmerican Rebel’s Board intends to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split in order to maintain its listing on Nasdaq as described below or at any time within the\nfollowing twelve months (the “Effective Time”).\nPurpose of the Reverse Stock Split\nThe primary purpose of implementing the reverse stock split would be to raise the per share trading price of our common stock. In particular, this will help\nus to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which has as one of its continued listing requirements a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per\nshare. Recently our common stock has traded significantly below $1.00 per share. On October 23, 2023, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC\nindicating that we failed to comply with the minimum bid price requirement, and that we have been provided with a 180-day grace period (which expires on April\n22, 2024) to regain compliance. If we are not in compliance by April 22, 2024, we may be afforded a second 180-day period to regain compliance. We will regain\ncompliance if the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days. The reverse stock split proposal is\nintended primarily to increase our per share bid price and satisfy the Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirement. Reducing the number of outstanding\nshares of our common stock should, absent other factors, increase the per share market price of our common stock, although we cannot provide any assurance that we\nwill be able to meet or maintain a bid price over the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market or any other exchange.\n15\nDelisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market may adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity\nsecurities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting\nalso could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development\nopportunities.\nIf we are delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market and we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on\nthe OTC Bulletin Board or in the “pink sheets.” As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others:\n● a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n● a determination that our common stock is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and\npossibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n● a limited amount of news and little or no analyst coverage of our company;\n● we would no longer qualify for exemptions from state securities registration requirements, which may require us to comply with applicable state securities\nlaws; and\n● a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form registration statements on Form S-3) or obtain additional financing in the\nfuture.\nIn addition, an increase in the per share trading value of our common stock would be beneficial because it would:\n● improve the perception of our common stock as an investment security;\n● reset our stock price to more normalized trading levels in the face of potentially extended market dislocations;\n● assist with future potential capital raises;\n● appeal to a broader range of investors to generate greater investor interest in us; and\n● reduce stockholder transaction costs because investors would pay lower commission to trade a fixed dollar amount of our stock if our stock price were\nhigher than they would if our stock price were lower.\nYou should consider that, although our Board believes that a reverse stock split will in fact increase the trading price of our common stock, in many cases,\nbecause of variables outside of our control (such as market volatility, investor response to the news of a proposed reverse stock split and the general economic\nenvironment), the market price of our Common Stock may in fact decline in value after effecting the Reverse Stock Split. You should also keep in mind that the\nimplementation of a reverse stock split does not have an effect on the actual or intrinsic value of our business or a stockholder’s proportional ownership in our\ncompany. However, should the overall value of our Common Stock decline after the proposed Reverse Stock Split, then the actual or intrinsic value of the shares of\nour Common Stock held by you will also proportionately decrease as a result of the overall decline in value.\nEffects of the Reverse Stock Split\nReduction of Shares Held by Individual Stockholders. After the Effective Date each Common Stockholder will own fewer shares of American Rebel’s\nCommon Stock. However, the Reverse Stock Split will affect all of the Common Stockholders uniformly and will not affect any Common Stockholder’s percentage\nownership interests in American Rebel, except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split results in any of its stockholders owning a fractional share as described\nbelow. Any fractional share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. Further, at the option of the Board on the Effective Date the Board may choose to\nimplement a provision that provides any stockholder as of the Effective Date who owns at least 100 shares will not own less than 100 shares as a result of the\nReverse Stock Split.\nChange in Number and Exercise Price of Employee and Equity Awards. The Reverse Stock Split will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock\navailable for issuance under American Rebel’s equity compensation arrangements in proportion to the split ratio. Under the terms of its outstanding equity and option\nawards, the Reverse Stock Split will cause a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or vesting of such awards in proportion to\nthe split ratio of the Reverse Stock Split which is ultimately approved by the Board and will cause a proportionate increase in the exercise price of such awards to the\nextent they are stock options. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or vesting of stock option awards will be rounded to the nearest whole\nshare and no cash payment will be made in respect of such rounding. Warrant and other convertible security holders, if any, will also see a similar reduction of the\nnumber of shares such instruments are convertible into stock option holders described above.\n16\nAuthorized Shares of Common Stock. The Reverse Stock Split, if implemented, would not change the number of authorized shares of the Common Stock\nas designated by American Rebel’s Articles of Incorporation. Therefore, because the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock would decrease, the\nnumber of shares remaining available for issuance under American Rebel’s authorized shares of Common Stock would increase.\nThe additional shares of Common Stock that would become available for issuance if the Reverse Stock Split is implemented could also be used by\nAmerican Rebel’s management to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes of control or changes in or removal of management, including\ntransactions that are favored by a majority of the stockholders or in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current\nmarket prices or benefit in some other manner. Although the proposed Reverse Stock Split has been prompted by business and financial considerations, stockholders\nnevertheless should be aware that this action could facilitate future efforts by American Rebel’s management to deter or prevent a change in control.\nAmerican Rebel has no current specific plans for the issuance of the Common Stock, which would become newly available as a result of the Reverse Stock\nSplit. Any future issuance will have the effect of diluting the percentage of stock ownership and voting rights of the present holders of American Rebel’s Common\nStock.\nOther Effects on Outstanding Shares. If the Reverse Stock Split is implemented, the rights and preferences of the outstanding shares of the Common\nStock would remain the same after the Reverse Stock Split. Each share of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split would be fully paid and non-\nassessable.\nNo Effect on Series A Preferred Stock Voting and Conversion. The voting and conversion rights attributed to the Series A Preferred shall remain\nunaffected by the Reverse Stock Split, if implemented, (each share of Series A Preferred shall continue to have 1,000:1 voting rights and 500:1 conversion rights).\nNo Effect on Series C Preferred Stock Conversion. The conversion rights attributed to the Series C Preferred shall remain unaffected by the Reverse\nStock Split, if implemented, (each share of Series C Preferred shall continue to have 5:1 conversion rights).\nRegulatory Effects. American Rebel’s Common Stock is currently registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and is subject to the periodic\nreporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act. The Reverse Stock Split will not affect the registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act or\nAmerican Rebel’s obligation to publicly file financial and other information with the SEC. If the Reverse Stock Split is implemented in order to maintain its Nasdaq\nlisting, American Rebel’s Common Stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn addition to the above, the Reverse Stock Split will have the following effects upon American Rebel’s Common Stock:\n● The number of shares owned by each holder of Common Stock will be reduced; however, at the option of the Board on the Effective Date the Board may choose\nto implement a provision that provides that no current owner of 100 or more shares will be reduced to less than 100 shares;\n● The per share loss and net book value of American Rebel’s Common Stock will be increased because there will be a lesser number of shares of its Common\nStock outstanding;\n● The par value of the Common Stock will remain $0.001 per share;\n● The stated capital on American Rebel’s balance sheet attributable to the Common Stock will be decreased and the additional paid-in capital account will be\ncredited with the amount by which the stated capital is decreased; and\n● All outstanding options, warrants, and convertible securities entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of Common Stock, if any, will enable such holders to\npurchase, upon exercise thereof, fewer of the number of shares of Common Stock which such holders would have been able to purchase upon exercise thereof\nimmediately preceding the Reverse Stock Split, at the same total price (but a higher per share price) required to be paid upon exercise thereof immediately\npreceding the Reverse Stock Split.\n17\nShares of Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split will be fully paid and non-assessable. The amendment will not change any of the other the terms of\nAmerican Rebel’s Common Stock or Preferred Stock. The shares of Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split will have the same voting rights and rights to\ndividends and distributions and will be identical in all other respects to the shares of Common Stock prior to the Reverse Stock Split.\nOnce American Rebel implements the Reverse Stock Split, the share certificates representing the shares will continue to be valid. In the future, new share\ncertificates will be issued reflecting the Reverse Stock Split, but this in no way will affect the validity of your current share certificates. The Reverse Stock Split will\noccur without any further action on the part of American Rebel’s stockholders. After the Effective Date each share certificate representing the shares prior to the\nReverse Stock Split will be deemed to represent a smaller number of shares than the number presently shown on the certificate.\nThe actual number of outstanding shares of American Rebel’s Common Stock after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split, if and when effected will\ndepend on the number of issued and outstanding shares at the time the Reverse Stock Split is effected and the Reverse Stock Split ratio that is ultimately determined\nby the Board. The table below shows the Reverse Stock Split ratio and the approximate number of authorized shares of Common Stock to be outstanding for various\nreverse split ratios:\nOutstanding Shares Outstanding Shares\nReverse Stock Split Ratio Before Reverse Stock Split(1) After Reverse Stock Split(2)\n1-for-2 5,947,643 2,973,822\n1-for-5 5,947,643 1,189,529\n1-for-8 5,947,643 743,456\n1-for-10 5,947,643 594,765\n(1) Does not account for the additional issuance of shares of Common Stock after the date hereof as the result of future financings, conversion of\noutstanding derivative securities or other issuances, which may be substantial.\n(2) Does not account for fractional share rounding or the potential qualification, to be determined by the Board in its sole discretion, that a stockholder who\nowns at least 100 shares will continue to own at least 100 shares. Such amount of shares would be material, for example, in the Company’s June 2023\n25:1 reverse stock split, the Company issued 1,488,615 shares of common stock as a result of this rounding provision.\nCertificates representing the shares after the Reverse Stock Split will be issued in due course as share certificates representing shares prior to the Reverse\nStock Split are tendered for exchange or transfer to American Rebel’s transfer agent. American Rebel request that stockholders do not send in any of their stock\ncertificates at this time.\nAs applicable, new share certificates evidencing new shares following the Reverse Stock Split that are issued in exchange for share certificates issued prior\nto the Reverse Stock Split representing old shares that are restricted shares will contain the same restrictive legend as on the old certificates. Also, for purposes of\ndetermining the term of the restrictive period applicable to the new shares after the Reverse Stock Split, the time period during which a stockholder has held their\nexisting pre-Reverse Stock Split old shares will be included in the total holding period.\n18\nProcedure for Implementing the Reverse Stock Split\nThe Reverse Stock Split will become effective upon the filing of the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State. The\ntiming of the filing of the amendment that will effectuate the Reverse Stock Split will be determined by the Board, at any time within 12 months, based on its\nevaluation as to when such action will be the most advantageous to American Rebel and its stockholders. In addition, the Board reserves the right, notwithstanding\nstockholder approval and without further action by the stockholders, to elect not to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split if, at any time prior to filing the amendment,\nthe Board, in its sole discretion, determines that it is no longer in American Rebel’s best interest and the best interests of its stockholders to proceed with the Reverse\nStock Split. If the amendment effectuating the Reverse Stock Split has not been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada by the close of twelve months\nfrom the Record Date, the Board will abandon the Reverse Stock Split.\nAfter the filing of the amendment, American Rebel’s Common Stock will have a new CUSIP number, which is a number used to identify its equity\nsecurities, and stock certificates with the older CUSIP number will need to be exchanged for stock certificates with the new CUSIP number by following the\nprocedures described below.\nAs soon as practicable after the Reverse Stock Split American Rebel’s transfer agent will act as exchange agent for purposes of implementing the exchange\nof stock certificates for record holders (i.e., stockholders who hold their shares directly in their own name and not through a broker). Record holders of pre-Reverse\nStock Split shares will be asked to surrender to the transfer agent certificates representing pre-Reverse Stock Split shares in exchange for a book entry with the\ntransfer agent or certificates representing post-Reverse Stock Split shares in accordance with the procedures to be set forth in a letter of transmittal to be sent by\nAmerican Rebel. No new certificates will be issued to a stockholder until such stockholder has surrendered such stockholder’s outstanding certificate(s) together with\nthe properly completed and executed letter of transmittal to the exchange agent.\nFor street name holders of pre-Reverse Stock Split shares (i.e., stockholders who hold their shares through a broker), your broker will make the appropriate\nadjustment to the number of shares held in your account following the Effective Date.\nSTOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT DESTROY ANY STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT ANY CERTIFICATE(S) UNTIL\nREQUESTED TO DO SO.\nNo service charges, brokerage commissions or transfer taxes will be payable by any stockholder, except that if any new stock certificates are to be issued in\na name other than that in which the surrendered certificate(s) are registered it will be a condition of such issuance that (1) the person requesting such issuance pays all\napplicable transfer taxes resulting from the transfer (or prior to transfer of such certificate, if any) or establishes to American Rebel’s satisfaction that such taxes have\nbeen paid or are not payable, (2) the transfer complies with all applicable federal and state securities laws, and (3) the surrendered certificate is properly endorsed and\notherwise in proper form for transfer.\nFractional Shares\nNo fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive\nfractional shares, upon surrender to the exchange agent of such certificates representing such fractional shares, will receive a number of shares rounded up to the\nnearest whole share.\nAccounting Matters\nThe par value per share of American Rebel’s Common Stock will remain unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Reverse Stock Split. As a result, on the\nEffective Date, the stated capital on American Rebel’s consolidated balance sheet attributable to Common Stock will be reduced and the additional paid-in-capital\naccount will be increased by the amount by which the stated capital is reduced. Per share net income or loss will be increased because there will be fewer shares of\nCommon Stock outstanding. American Rebel does not anticipate that any other accounting consequences, including changes to the amount of stock-based\ncompensation expense to be recognized in any period, will arise as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.\n19\nCertain Federal Income Tax Consequences\nEach stockholder is advised to consult their own tax advisor as the following discussion may be limited, modified or not apply based on your own\nparticular situation.\nThe following is a summary of important tax considerations of the Reverse Stock Split. It addresses only stockholders who hold the pre-Reverse Stock Split\nshares and post-Reverse Stock Split shares as capital assets. It does not purport to be complete and does not address stockholders subject to special rules, such as\nfinancial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, mutual funds, foreign stockholders, stockholders who hold the pre-\nReverse Stock Split shares as part of a straddle, hedge, or conversion transaction, stockholders who hold the pre-Reverse Stock Split shares as qualified small\nbusiness stock within the meaning of Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), stockholders who are subject to the alternative\nminimum tax provisions of the Code, and stockholders who acquired their pre-Reverse Stock Split shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or\notherwise as compensation. This summary is based upon current law, which may change, possibly even retroactively. It does not address tax considerations under\nstate, local, foreign, and other laws. Furthermore, American Rebel has not obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of legal or tax counsel\nwith respect to the consequences of the Reverse Stock Split.\nThe Reverse Stock Split is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. Assuming the Reverse Stock Split\nqualifies as reorganization, a stockholder generally will not recognize gain or loss on the Reverse Stock Split. The aggregate tax basis of the post-Reverse Stock Split\nshares received will be equal to the aggregate tax basis of the pre-Reverse Stock Split shares exchanged (excluding any portion of the holder’s basis allocated to\nfractional shares), and the holding period of the post-Reverse Stock Split shares received will include the holding period of the pre-Reverse Stock Split shares\nexchanged.\nPLEASE CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN INCOME AND\nOTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT IN YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER THE INTERNAL\nREVENUE CODE AND THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION.\nTo ensure compliance with Treasury Department Circular 230, each holder of Common Stock is hereby notified that: (a) any discussion of U.S.\nfederal tax issues in this information statement is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, by such holder for the purpose of avoiding\npenalties that may be imposed on such holder under the Code; (b) any such discussion has been included by American Rebel in furtherance of the Reverse\nStock Split on the terms described herein and (c) each such holder should seek advice based on its particular circumstances from an independent tax\nadvisor.\nNo Appraisal Rights\nUnder NRS, stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights with respect to the proposed amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to effectuate the\nReverse Stock Split.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of the Reverse Stock Split\nThe overall effect of the Reverse Stock Split may be to render more difficult the accomplishment of mergers or the assumption of control by a principal\nstockholder and thus make the removal of management more difficult.\nThe effective increase in American Rebel’s authorized and unissued shares as a result of the Reverse Stock Split could potentially be used by the Board to\nthwart a takeover attempt. The over-all effects of this might be to discourage, or make it more difficult to engage in, a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, or the\nacquisition or assumption of control by a holder of a large block of American Rebel’s securities and the removal of incumbent management. The Reverse Stock Split\ncould make the accomplishment of a merger or similar transaction more difficult, even if it is beneficial to stockholders. The Board might use the additional shares to\nresist or frustrate a third-party transaction, favored by a majority of the independent stockholders that would provide an above-market premium, by issuing additional\nshares to frustrate the takeover effort.\n20\nThis Reverse Stock Split is not the result of management’s knowledge of an effort to accumulate American Rebel’s securities or to obtain control of\nAmerican Rebel by means of a merger, tender offer, solicitation or otherwise.\nAdditionally, the Reverse Stock Split is not being conducted in an effort to take American Rebel private.\nThe form of amendment to Article VI of the Articles of Incorporation is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement.\nACTION 3. RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF BF BORGERS CPA, P.C. AS AUDITORS FOR THE NEXT YEAR\nAmerican Rebel’s board of directors selected BF Borgers CPA, P.C. (“BF Borgers”) as its independent auditor for the current fiscal year ended December\n31, 2023, and the Written Consent ratified that selection.\nThe following table presents the fees for professional audit services rendered by BF Borgers CPA, a professional corporation (“BF Borgers”) for the audit of\nthe Company’s annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and fees billed for other services rendered by BF\nBorgers during those periods. All services reflected in the following fee table for 2022 and 2021 were pre-approved, respectively, in accordance with the policy of the\nBoard.\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nAudit fees (1) $ 136,600 $ 37,000\nAudit-related fees - -\nTax fees - -\nAll other fees(2) 219,000 18,900\nTotal Fees $ 355,600 $ 55,900\nNotes:\n(1) Audit fees consist of audit and review services, consent and review of documents filed with the SEC. For fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021.\n(2) Comfort letter and consent to use audited financial statements in additional filings related to underwritten public offering. Approximately $150,000 was\npaid to Champion’s independent PCAOB registered accounting firm to conduct Champion’s most recent two fiscal years of audit and interim review\nreports which was required for the acquisition of Champion. These fees were paid by the Company and the PCAOB registered accounting firm was BF\nBorgers.\nIn its capacity, the audit committee of the Board pre-approves all audit (including audit-related) and permitted non-audit services to be performed by the\nindependent auditors. The committee will annually approve the scope and fee estimates for the year-end audit to be performed by the Company’s independent\nauditors for the fiscal year. With respect to other permitted services, the committee pre-approves specific engagements, projects and categories of services on a fiscal\nyear basis, subject to individual project and annual maximums. To date, the Company has not engaged its auditors to perform any non-audit related services.\nOTHER MATTERS\nAnnual Report\nA copy of the 2022 Form 10-K report as required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, excluding exhibits, will be mailed to\nstockholders without charge upon written request to American Rebel Holdings, Inc.

American Rebel reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these\nand other applicable requirements.\nStockholders Sharing the Same Address\nThe SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy materials with respect to\ntwo or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single set of proxy materials addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly\nreferred to as “householding,” potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.\nOne set of information statement materials will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless the affected stockholders have submitted\ncontrary instructions. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be “householding” communications to your address, “householding” will\ncontinue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a\nseparate set of information statement materials, please notify your broker or American Rebel. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the information\nstatement materials at their addresses and would like to request “householding” of their communications should contact their brokers or American Rebel.

          "content": "American Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nCODE OF ETHICS\nAND BUSINESS CONDUCT\n1. Introduction.\n1.1 The Board of Directors of American Rebel Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the\n“Company”), has adopted this Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the “Code”) in order to:\n(a) promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent\nconflicts of interest;\n(b) promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and\ndocuments that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”) and in other public communications made by the Company;\n(c) promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n(d) promote the protection of Company assets, including corporate opportunities and\nconfidential information;\n(e) promote fair dealing practices;\n(f) deter wrongdoing; and\n(g) ensure accountability for adherence to the Code.\n1.2 All directors, officers and employees are required to be familiar with the Code, comply\nwith its provisions and report any suspected violations as described below in Section 10,\nReporting and Enforcement.\n2. Honest and Ethical Conduct.\n2.1 The Company’s policy is to promote high standards of integrity by conducting its affairs\nhonestly and ethically.\n2.2 Each director, officer and employee must act with integrity and observe the highest ethical\nstandards of business conduct in his or her dealings with the Company’s customers,\nsuppliers, partners, service providers, competitors, employees and anyone else with\nwhom he or she has contact in the course of performing his or her job.\n3. Conflicts of Interest.\n3.1 A conflict of interest occurs when an individual’s private interest (or the interest of a member\nof his or her family) interferes, or even appears to interfere, with the interests of the Company\nas a whole. A conflict of interest can arise when an employee, officer or director (or a\nmember of his or her family) takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to\nperform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest\nalso arise when an employee, officer or director (or a member of his or her family) receives\nimproper personal benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company.\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nCode of Ethics and Business Conduct\n3.2 Loans by the Company to, or guarantees by the Company of obligations of, employees\nor their family members are of special concern and could constitute improper personal\nbenefits to the recipients of such loans or guarantees, depending on the facts and circum\nstances. Loans by the Company to, or guarantees by the Company of obligations of, any\ndirector, officer, or their family members are expressly prohibited.\n3.3 Whether or not a conflict of interest exists or will exist can be unclear. Conflicts of interest\nshould be avoided unless specifically authorized as described in Section 3.4.\n3.4 Persons other than directors and executive officers who have questions about a potential\nconflict of interest or who become aware of an actual or potential conflict should discuss\nthe matter with, and seek a determination and prior authorization or approval from, their\nsupervisor or the Chief Operating Officer.

If the supervisor\nis himself or herself involved in the potential or actual conflict, the matter should instead\nbe discussed directly with the Chief Operating Officer.\nDirectors and executive officers must seek determinations and prior authorizations or\napprovals of potential conflicts of interest exclusively from the Audit Committee of the Board of\nDirectors (the “Audit Committee”).\n4.

Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets.\n6.1 All directors, officers and employees should protect the Company’s assets and ensure\ntheir efficient use. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company’s\nprofitability and are prohibited.\n6.2 All Company assets should be used only for legitimate business purposes.

          "content": "American Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nPOLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDE\nINFORMATION AND INSIDER TRADING\nNeed for a Policy.\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) Board of Directors (the “Board”) has adopted\nthis policy to promote compliance with the federal and state securities laws prohibiting insider trading\nand to protect the Company, as well as its directors, officers, employees, contractors and consultants,\nfrom liabilities and penalties that can result from violations of these laws. Each individual is responsible\nfor ensuring that she or he does not violate federal or state securities laws or this policy.\nThis policy outlines what insider trading is and the types of transactions that are prohibited\nand describes the penalties for insider trading. This policy also implements procedures that require\nthe Company’s directors, officers and employees to effect transactions in the Company’s stock only\nduring certain periods (“trading windows”) and to pre-clear all such transactions with the Company’s\nChief Compliance Officer named below.\nIf you have questions about this policy or its application or if you believe another person is\nuncertain about the application of this policy, you should promptly contact the Company’s Chief\nCompliance Officer.\nScope of the Policy.\nThis policy applies to all directors, officers and employees of the Company (the “Covered Persons”).\nThe Company may also determine that other persons should be subject to this policy, such as\ncontractors or consultants who have access to material nonpublic information; and if so, these persons\nwill be considered “Covered Persons” for purposes of this policy. The restrictions also apply to a\nCovered Person’s “Related Persons,” as described below. Each Covered Person is expected to\nbe responsible for the compliance of his or her Related Persons, and transactions by such Related\nPersons should be treated for the purposes of this policy and applicable securities laws as if they were\nfor the account of such Covered Person.\nThis policy applies to all transactions in the Company’s securities, including common stock,\noptions, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and\nany other securities the Company may issue from time to time, such as preferred stock, warrants, debt\nsecurities and convertible debentures, as well as to derivative securities relating to the Company’s stock,\nwhether or not issued by the Company (collectively referred to as “Securities”). Please see below for\ncertain exceptions to this Policy.\nChief Compliance Officer\nThe Company has designated the Company’s [•] as the Company’s “Chief Compliance\nOfficer.”\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nPolicy Statement on Inside Information and Insider Trading\nPenalties for Insider Trading.\nInsider trading is prohibited by federal and state laws and is enforced vigorously by the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as well as federal and state enforcement authorities. Punishment for\ninsider trading can be severe and could include significant civil penalties and criminal fines, including\njail time. In addition, any individual violating insider trading laws may be sued by any other investors\nwho purchased or sold Securities at the same time that the illegal insider trading occurred. Moreover, if an\nemployee violates this policy, Company-imposed sanctions, including dismissal for cause, could result.\nIf the Company (as well as any supervisory person) fails to take appropriate steps to prevent\nillegal trading, the Company and the supervisory person may be subject to significant civil penalties\nand criminal fines, and the Company may be subject to claims by other persons who purchased or\nsold Securities at the same time.\nNeedless to say, any of the above consequences, or even an SEC investigation that does not\nresult in prosecution, could tarnish the reputation of the individuals involved and of the Company and\ncause irreparable damage.\nOur Policy.\nTrading by Covered Persons and Family Members on the Basis of Material Non-public Information.\nNo Covered Person who is aware of material non-public information relating to the Company may,\ndirectly or indirectly through “Related Persons” (as described below), buy, sell or make certain transfers\nof Securities (other than pursuant to a Qualified Trading Plan as described below), recommend the\npurchase and sale of any Securities to, or share such material non-public information with, others.\nFurthermore, no Covered Person may buy or sell, or recommend the purchase or sale of, securities\nof any other company based on material non-public information about such other company that may\nhave been obtained in the course of employment with the Company.\nRelated Persons. This policy also applies to “Related Persons.” “Related Persons” are (1) any\nfamily member or other person who resides with a Covered Person, (2) any family member who does\nnot live in the same household but whose transactions in Securities are directed by such Covered\nPerson or is subject to such Covered Person’s influence or control (such as parents, children or other\nrelatives who consult with you before they trade in Securities), and (3) any entity that is influenced or\ncontrolled by such Covered Person, including any corporations, partnerships or trusts. Each Covered\nPerson is expected to be responsible for the compliance of his or her Related Persons, and transactions by\nsuch Related Persons should be treated for the purposes of this policy and applicable securities laws\nas if they are for the account of such Covered Person.\nTransactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons (such as the need to\nraise money for an emergency expenditure) are no exception. Further, it also does not matter whether\nthe information was pertinent to the decision to trade; any trading by a Covered Person while in\nthe possession of material non-public information violates the law. Even the appearance of an improper\ntransaction must be avoided in order to preserve our reputation for adhering to the highest standards\nof conduct.\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nPolicy Statement on Inside Information and Insider Trading\nThis policy also applies to any elective transactions relating to Securities under the Company’s\nSARSEP plan or any other investment or retirement plan. You should seek guidance from the Chief\nCompliance Officer if you are considering elective transactions relating to the Securities and you think\nyou may be in possession of material non-public information.\nTipping Information to Others. As stated above, Covered Persons must not pass material non-public\ninformation on to others. The above penalties apply whether or not you derive any financial benefit\nfrom another person’s trading. The SEC imposes substantial penalties on tippers even though they did\nnot profit from their tippees’ trading. No Covered Person may disclose material non-public information\nto other of the Company’s employees who do not have a “need to know” such material non-public\ninformation, or outside of the Company to other persons, including family, friends and other persons\nnot associated with the Company, unless such disclosure is made in accordance with the Company’s\npolicies regarding public disclosure of information regarding the Company. To avoid even the appearance\nof “tipping,” you should refrain from making recommendations about buying or selling Securities or\nthe securities of other entities with which the Company has a relationship. The restriction on insider\ntrading is not limited to trading in the Company’s Securities. It includes trading in the securities of\nother entities, such as those that are customers or suppliers of the Company and those with which\nthe Company may be negotiating transactions, such as an acquisition, investment or sale. Information\nthat is not material to the Company may nevertheless be material to one of those other entities.\nAny statement made on the internet or via social media regarding the Company may be seen as\na recommendation to buy or sell Securities. Each person subject to this policy is prohibited from posting\non the internet or via social media any information regarding the Company or other entities with which\nthe Company has a relationship, other than in authorized Company communications. Furthermore,\nno one in the Company should initiate publicity for the purpose of, or that may have the effect of\nimpacting the price of the Company’s publicly traded securities. All officers, directors, and employees of\nthe Company should consult with the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer before engaging in public\nstatements. This includes granting interviews, accepting invitations to speak, appearing at conferences,\nand engaging in public discourse whether virtually or in person.\nPost Termination Transactions. This policy continues to apply to transactions in Securities or\nthe securities of other entities with which the Company has a relationship even after a person ceases\nto be a Covered Person. If a Covered Person is in possession of material non-public information when\nhis or her relationship with the Company is terminated, she or he, and her or his Related Persons, as\ndescribed above, may not trade in Securities or the securities of the entity with which the Company\nhas a relationship and to which the information relates until that information is deemed public or no\nlonger material.\nMaterial Information. It is not possible to define all categories of information that could be\ndeemed “material.” In general, material information is any information that a reasonable investor would\nconsider important in a decision to buy, hold or sell stock or any information which could reasonably\naffect the price of the stock. Depending on the significance of the effect on our results or operations,\ncommon examples of material information may include: news of current earnings or losses;\nprojections of future earnings or losses; reserve estimate updates or changes; news of a pending\nor proposed merger, acquisition, joint venture, divestiture, tender offer or sale or purchase of assets;\ndevelopments or problems at any material property; positive or negative developments regarding\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nPolicy Statement on Inside Information and Insider Trading\nlitigation or governmental investigations; changes in dividend policies or the declaration of a stock\nsplit or the offering of additional securities; changes in management; significant balance sheet and\nratings issues; borrowings; discovery of a cybersecurity incident; and impending bankruptcy\nor financial liquidity problems. Either positive or negative information may be considered material.\nMaterial information may also include information originating outside the Company, such as planned\nsales or purchases of Securities by third parties.\nIf you are uncertain whether information is material non-public information, you must consult\nwith the Chief Compliance Officer before you transact in any Securities.\nWhen Does Information Become Public? As you can appreciate, it is also improper for a Covered\nPerson to enter into a trade immediately after the Company makes a public announcement of material\ninformation before the market has had time to react. Because the Company’s shareholders and the\ninvesting public should be afforded the time to receive the information and act upon it, information\nbecomes public (and ceases to be “non-public”) after an official announcement of it has been released\nto the public (either through normal media outlets or a SEC or stock exchange filing) and there has\nbeen adequate time for the information to be circulated and absorbed by investors and the marketplace.\nFor purposes of this policy, information that is publicly released will be considered public following\nmarket close on the second full business day following the public release. Covered Persons should not\nengage in any transactions in Securities until after the close of the second full business day following\nrelease of the information. Thus:\n• if an announcement is made on a Monday, Thursday, generally, would be the first dayon\nwhich trading is permitted; and\n• if an announcement is made on Thursday, Tuesday, generally, would be the first day.\nInformation released after trading on the Nasdaq has closed will be considered to have been released\nthe following business day.\nTwenty-Twenty Hindsight. Remember, securities transactions that become the subject of scrutiny\nwill be viewed after-the-fact with the benefit of hindsight. As a result, before engaging in any transaction,\neach person subject to this policy should carefully consider how regulators and others might view his\nor her transaction in hindsight.\nIndividual Responsibility.\nEach individual is responsible for making sure that she or he complies with this policy and any\naction on the part of the Company or its Chief Compliance Officer does not in any way constitute legal\nadvice or insulate an individual from liability under the applicable laws. For example, a Covered Person\nmay not buy or sell Securities on the basis of material non-public information even if such person received\npre-clearance for the transaction.\nAdditionally, care must be taken to safeguard, physically and electronically, the confidentiality\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nPolicy Statement on Inside Information and Insider Trading\nof internal information. For example, sensitive documents should not be left lying on desks, visitors\nshould not be left unattended in offices containing internal Company documents, and each individual\nshould take preventative measures--including on her or his own electronic devices--to protect Company’s\ninformation, and ensure that data storage and transmission systems are secure at all times.\nAdditional Prohibited Transactions Applicable to Covered Persons.\nThe Company also believes it is improper and inappropriate for any Covered Person to engage\nin short-term or speculative transactions involving Securities, and therefore, it is the Company’s policy\nthat Covered Persons should not engage in any of the following activities:\n1. Trading in Securities on a short-term basis. Any Securities purchased on the open market\nshould be held for a minimum of six months and ideally longer. The SEC’s “short swing profit”\nrule already makes it illegal for officers and directors to sell any Securities within six months\nof a purchase or likewise to purchase any Securities within six months of a sale. The rule,\nhowever, does not apply to certain grants of stock options and stock option exercises.\n2. Purchases of Securities on margin.\n3. Short sales of Securities.\n4. Buying orselling put or call options or other derivative securities relating to Securities.\n5. Engaging in hedging or monetization transactions, such as collars, equity swaps, prepaid\nvariable forwards and exchange funds with respect to Securities.\n6. Participating in investment clubs that invest in Securities.\n7. Holding Securities in a margin account.\n8. Other than pursuant to a Qualified Trading Plan (as described below), placing open\norders (i) of longer than three business days or (ii) ending after a trading window has closed.\n9. Pledging Securities as security for any obligation.\nTrading Windows; Pre-Clearance of All Trades By CoveredPersons.\nTo provide assistance in preventing inadvertent violations and avoiding even the appearance\nof an improper transaction (which could result, for example, where a Covered Person engages in a\ntrade while unaware of a pending material development), the following procedures apply to all\nCovered Persons and their respective Related Persons:\n1. Pre-Clearance. Covered Persons and their respective Related Persons may purchase, sell\nor transfer Securities only after written pre-clearing the transaction with the Chief Compliance\nOfficer (including a stock plan transaction such as an option exercise, a gift, a contribution to\na trust or any other transfer).\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nPolicy Statement on Inside Information and Insider Trading\n2. Pre-Clearance Request. A request for pre-clearance should be submitted to the Chief\nCompliance Officer at least three business days in advance of the proposed transaction. To\ncomply with the short-swing profit rule, the requesting person should also indicate whether\nshe or he has affected any transactions in Securities within the past six months.\n3. Trading Black-Outs. Trading will be blacked out and Covered Persons and their respective\nRelated Persons may not engage in a transaction in Securities beginning on the date that is\ntwo weeks prior to the last business day of each fiscal quarter and ending at the close of\nbusiness two full business days after the Company’s release of its quarterly or annual results.\n4. Trading Windows. The Company will typically have a trading window open for trading\nbetween the close of business two full business days after the Company’s release of its\nquarterly or annual results and the close of business on the date that is two weeks prior to the\nlast business day of each fiscal quarter. However, the trading window will be closed, and\ntransactions will not be cleared in the event there is a new, material non-public development,\nincluding a material financial result, material acquisition, or other material corporate event,\nthat is known prior to the start of the black-out period. This may occur at any time during an\nopen trading window.\nExceptions to the Policy.\nTrades made pursuant to a “Qualified Trading Plan.” Trades made pursuant to a Qualified Trading\nPlan act as an affirmative defense to allegations of insider trading and are not subject to procedures\n1-4 above. A “Qualified Trading Plan” is a written plan for selling the Company’s common stock which\nmeets each of the following requirements and complies with Rule 10b5-1(c) as currently adopted or\namended by the SEC:\n1. The plan or an amendment thereto, is adopted by the Covered Person during a trading window\nwhile not aware of any material non-public information;\n2. The plan or an amendment thereto, is in writing and pre-approved by the Chief Compliance\nOfficer;\n3. The plan is adhered to strictly;\n4. The plan either expressly specifies sales of stock in the amounts, and at the prices, and on\nthe dates at which the Covered Person sells the stock or provides a written formula or algorithm\nfor determining the amounts, prices and dates of sales; and\n5. At the time it is adopted the plan conforms to all other requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(C)\nas currently adopted or amended by the SEC and any other restrictions applicable to trading\nof stock by directors and officers (e.g., Rule 144).\nAmong the factors the Chief Compliance Officer will consider in approving a Qualified Trading\nPlan are the term of the plan, the schedule for sales, whether there is a waiting period before trades\nunder the plan may commence, whether a prior plan has been terminated prior to its expiration date\nrecently, as well as other considerations that the Chief Compliance Officer finds relevant in evaluating\nQualified Trading Plans in light of this policy.\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nPolicy Statement on Inside Information and Insider Trading\nStock Option Exercises. This policy does not apply to exercises of non-transferable stock\noptions granted by the Company, provided that such exercise is not followed by a sale or other\ntransfer of Securities received for the option, or the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to\nwhich a person has elected to have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy\ntax withholding requirements. This policy does apply, however, to any sale of Securities as a part\nof a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option, or any other market sale for the purpose of\ngenerating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option. Please notify the Chief Compliance\nOfficer if you intend to exercise any stock options.\nRestricted Stock Awards and Performance Awards. This policy does not apply to the vesting\nof restricted stock or performance awards. This policy does, however, apply to any market sale of\nrestricted stock or performance awards, including the sale of stock in order to satisfy tax obligations.\nBona Fide Gifts. This policy does not apply to bona fide gifts, provided, however, Covered\nPersons may only make gifts during an open trading window and must notify the Chief Compliance\nOfficer in advance of making the gift.\nReporting Compliance for Directors and Section 16 Officers.\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires directors, Section 16 Officers\nand 10% owners of the Company (collectively, “insiders”) to file reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5, as\nappropriate, to report their transactions (including bona fide gifts) and holdings involving Securities.\nSection 16 requires reporting on all acquisitions and dispositions of options and other derivative\nsecurities by insiders. Derivative securities include options, warrants, convertible securities, stock\nappreciation rights or similar rights. Section 16 mandates reporting of most transactions in the\nCompany’s Securities within two business days. Although the preparation and filing of these reports\nlegally are the sole responsibility of the insiders, the Company recognizes that the reporting\nrequirements are complex and that mistakes can result in disclosures which are embarrassing to\nthe reporting person and the Company. Accordingly, the Company will assist directors and Section 16\nOfficers in making these filings and has established the following procedures for doing so:\n1. Chief Compliance Officer.\nThe Chief Compliance Officer will assist all directors and Section 16 Officers in the preparation\nand filing of their Form 3, Form 4 and Form 5 reports.\n2. Notifying the Chief Compliance Officer of Transactions.\nAt least three days prior to engaging in any transaction involving Securities, directors and\nSection 16 Officers must notify the Chief Compliance Officer in writing of the details of\nthe proposed transaction, including:\n(a) the date of the proposed transaction;\n(b) the type and number of Securities involved in the transaction;\n(c) the consideration, if any, proposed to be paid or received in the transaction;\n(d) whether the director or Section 16 Officer directly or indirectly owns or will own the Securities;\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nPolicy Statement on Inside Information and Insider Trading\n(e) in the case of a proposed sale, whether the director or Section 16 Officer has purchased\nany Securities within the six months immediately preceding such proposed sale;\n(f) in the case of a proposed purchase, whether the director or Section 16 Officer has\nsold any Securities in the six months immediately preceding such proposed purchase; and\n(g) the nature of any indirect ownership in the Securities involved in the transaction\n(e.g., ownership by a spouse, trust, family limited partnership, etc.).\nThe importance of immediately notifying the Chief Compliance Officer of transactions in\nwhich either you or any Related Person engage cannot be over-emphasized, particularly in light of\nthe two-day reporting deadline for most transactions, as it will help to avoid the sanctions and the\nembarrassment that can result from a failure to comply with applicable securities law provisions.\n3. Broker Interface Procedures.\nThe two-day reporting of transactions requires tight interface with brokers handling\ntransactions for directors and Section 16 Officers. A knowledgeable, alert broker can act\nas a gatekeeper, helping ensure compliance with our pre-clearance procedures and helping\nprevent inadvertent violations.\nEach director and Section 16 Officer using any broker must sign and have his or her broker\nsign the enclosed Broker Instruction/Representation form, which imposes two requirements on\nthe broker handling transactions in Securities:\n(a) Not to enter any order (except for orders under pre-approved Qualified Trading\nPlans) without first:\n• verifying with the Chief Compliance Officer that the transaction was precleared, and\n• complying with the brokerage firm’s compliance procedures (e.g., Rule 144).\n(b) To report immediately to the Chief Compliance Officer the details of every transaction\ninvolving Securities, including gifts, transfers, pledges, and all transactions under\na Qualified Trading Plan by telephone and in writing by email.\nPlease sign and have your broker sign the enclosed Broker Instruction/Representation form\nand have it returned to the Chief Compliance Officer immediately so that s/he can work with your\nbroker to develop a coordinated procedure.\n4. Electronic Filing of Section 16 Reports.\nIn order to facilitate timely filing of Section 16 reports by the Company’s directors and\nSection 16 Officers, the Company has implemented electronic filing of Section 16 reports\nvia the SEC’s EDGAR system. In order to file a report on EDGAR, each director and\nSection 16 Officer will need an EDGAR filing number and password from the SEC. If you\nhave not already done so, please advise the Chief Compliance Officer whether you have\nobtained EDGAR access codes based on your service as a director or Section 16 Officer\nfor another company. If you have not, the Company will obtain these access codes on\nyour behalf.\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nPolicy Statement on Inside Information and Insider Trading\n5. Disclosure of Delinquent Reports.\nThere is no provision for an extension of the filing deadlines, and the SEC can take\nenforcement action against Section 16 reporting persons who do not comply fully with\nthe filing requirements. In addition, the Company is required to report the number of late\nfilings of reports under Section 16(a) in the Company’s proxy statement for its annual\nmeeting and to identify the insiders who made the late filings.\nCompany Assistance.\nAny person who has any questions about specific transactions should obtain additional\nguidance from the Chief Compliance Officer. Remember, however, the ultimate responsibility for\nadhering to the policy and avoiding improper transactions rests with each Covered Person. In this\nregard, it is imperative that each Covered Person use his or her best judgment.\nCertifications.\nEmployees will be required to certify their understanding of and intent to comply with this\npolicy and may be required to certify compliance on an annual basis.\nCERTIFICATION\nThe undersigned hereby certifies that he/she has received, read and understands, and agrees to\ncomply with, the Insider Trading Policy.\nDate: , 2021\nSignature:\nName:\n(Please Print)\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.\nPolicy Statement on Inside Information and Insider Trading\nBROKER INSTRUCTION/REPRESENTATION\nTO: [Broker]\nFROM:\nRE: Pre-clearance Procedure for All Transactions, Including Transfers, etc. Involving Stock of Royal Gold, Inc.\nIn order to comply with the two-day filing requirement for transactions by officers and directors and others\n(including family members) subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Royal Gold, Inc.\n(the “Company”) has you to sign this form and immediately return it to the Company as instructed below.\n1.
