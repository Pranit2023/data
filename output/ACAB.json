II\n\nJanuary 22, 2024 08:00 ET | Source:  [Abpro Corporation](/en/search/organization/Abpro%2520Corporation) Follow Abpro Corporation\n\nShare\n\nWOBURN, Mass. and NEW YORK, Jan. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abpro Corporation (“Abpro”), a biotech company with the mission of improving the lives of mankind facing severe and life-threatening diseases with next-generation antibody therapies, and Atlantic Coastal Acquisition Corp. II (NASDAQ: ACAB), a special purpose acquisition company (“Atlantic Coastal”), today announced the filing of a registration statement on Form S-4 (the “Registration Statement”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 19, 2024, which includes a preliminary proxy statement and prospectus in connection with its proposed business combination.\n\nUpon the closing of the proposed business combination, the combined company is expected to be named “Abpro Corporation” and to list its common stock on Nasdaq under the new ticker symbol “ABP”. The proposed business combination sets Abpro’s implied pre-money equity valuation at $500 million. Consistent with the recent signing of the Business Combination Agreement, the Atlantic Coastal and Abpro boards of directors have approved the proposed business combination, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024 subject to, among other things, the approval by Atlantic Coastal and Abpro stockholders, and other customary closing conditions.\n\n“We are thrilled to be one step closer to fulfilling our public journey to advance our pipeline of next-generation antibody therapeutics, and to be closer to providing critical therapies to those who need it most,” stated Ian Chan, CEO and co-founder of Abpro. “We have made significant strides in advancing our lead candidates in oncology and ophthalmology, which are two areas of significant unmet medical need. With this filing, we are excited for what lies ahead for both our company and the future of antibody-driven therapeutics.”\n\n“We are excited to be partnering with Abpro and recognize the potential of the company’s robust drug discovery platform, novel candidates and significant strategic partnerships,” said Shahraab Ahmad, CEO of Atlantic Coastal. “Abpro is supported by an experienced leadership team and board that we believe will lead the company to create significant value for shareholders.”\n\n“In my experience as a long-term biotech investor, I have been most impressed with the caliber of the team at Abpro and have confidence in their ability to achieve the targets that they have set for themselves,” added Tony Eisenberg, CSO of Atlantic Coastal. “Advancing towards a listing on Nasdaq is the next step in the company’s journey to bring its pioneering research and drug development platform to market.”\n\nWhile the Registration Statement has not yet become effective, and the information contained therein is subject to change, it provides important information about Abpro, Atlantic Coastal, and the proposed business combination.\n\n**Abpro at a Glance**\n\n  * By leveraging its proprietary  _DiversImmune_ _®_ and  _MultiMab_ _TM_ antibody discovery and engineering platforms, Abpro is advancing a pipeline of next-generation antibodies, both independently and through collaborations with global pharmaceutical and research institutions.\n  * Abpro’s lead candidate ABP-102, a next generation immuno-oncology TetraBi antibody targeting HER2 and CD3, is in development for the treatment of HER2+ solid tumors, including breast and gastric cancer. ABP-102 is being developed and commercialized through a worldwide strategic partnership with Celltrion, Inc. (“Celltrion”) (KRX: 068270) a leading Korean biopharmaceutical company. Celltrion is conducting a dose range finding study in a xenograft mouse model. An in vivo efficacy study in a xenograft mouse is planned for the first half of 2024.\n  * Abpro is advancing its lead candidate ABP-201, a TetraBi antibody format designed to simultaneously inhibit VEGF and ANG-2, into the clinic for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration.\n  * Abpro is advancing a broad pipeline of immuno-oncology agents that redirect T cells to a diverse range of liquid and solid tumors. ABP-110, targeting GPC3 on hepatocellular carcinoma, and ABP-150, targeting Claudin 18.2 on gastric cancer, are currently in preclinical development.\n\n\n\n**Advisors**\n\nBrookline Capital Markets, a division of Arcadia Securities, LLC, acted as a financial advisor to Abpro Corporation.\n\nCohen & Company Capital Markets, a division of J.V.B.

          "content": "ATLANTIC COASTAL ACQUISITION CORP. II\nCODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS\nIntroduction\nIt is the general policy of Atlantic Coastal Acquisition Corp. II (the “Company”) to\nconduct its business activities and transactions with the highest level of integrity and ethical\nstandards and in accordance with all applicable laws. In carrying out this policy, the Company\nhas adopted the following Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (this “Code”). In addition to\nbeing bound by any other codes, policies, and procedures of the Company, all of the employees\nof the Company are subject to the following additional specific policies contained in this Code.\nThis Code covers a wide range of business practices and procedures. It does not cover\nevery issue that may arise, but it sets out basic principles to guide all employees, officers, and\ndirectors of the Company and its subsidiaries. Those persons designated as the Company’s\nsenior financial officers in the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers shall also be required\nto comply with the provisions thereof. All such persons must conduct themselves accordingly\nand seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. Those who violate the standards in\nthis Code or who fail to cooperate with management directions given to effect compliance with\nthis Code may be subject to disciplinary action, possibly including termination of employment.\nIf you have any questions regarding this Code, you should address these questions to\nyour supervisor or to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company.\nBasic Principles and Practices\nCompliance with Laws, Rules, and Regulations\nCompany policy requires that our business activities comply with both the letter and the\nspirit of all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Although not all employees are expected to\nknow the details of these laws, it is important to know enough to determine when to seek advice\nfrom supervisors, managers, or other appropriate personnel.\nConfidentiality\nEmployees who come into possession of non-public information regarding the Company\nor any other companies as to which the employee receives information not available to investors\ngenerally must safeguard the information from the public and not intentionally or inadvertently\ncommunicate it to any person (including family members and friends) unless the person has a\nneed to know the information for legitimate, Company-related reasons. This duty of\nconfidentiality is important both as to the Company’s competitive position and with respect to\nthe securities laws applicable to the Company as a public company. Confidential information\ncannot be disclosed by any employee to any third party unless the third party has signed a\nnondisclosure agreement approved by the Company’s management, and should be divulged only\nto persons having a need to know the information in order to carry out their job responsibilities.\nFurther, you may not use any confidential information other than for legitimate, Company-\nrelated reasons. You must also abide by any specific agreements, such as a Confidential\n4863-1429-8627.v5\nInformation and Invention Assignment Agreement and Company policies regarding\nconfidentiality between you and the Company.\nConsistent with the foregoing, all employees should be discreet with respect to\nconfidential information about the Company or any other companies as to which the employee\nreceives information not available to investors generally and not discuss it in public places.\nConfidential information related to the Company or any other companies as to which the\nemployee receives information not available to investors generally can include a variety of\nmaterials and information regarding the ongoing operations and plans of the Company, and also\nincludes information that customers, partners, or vendors have provided to us. For example,\nconfidential information can include facility or product development plans, patents, significant\nnew contracts, information regarding the financial health and performance of the Company or\nother companies, salary and personnel information, plans regarding significant acquisitions or\ndivestitures, plans to raise additional capital, and marketing and sales plans.\nConflicts of Interest\nA “conflict of interest” arises when a person’s loyalties or actions are divided between\nthe interests of the Company and those of another, such as a competitor, supplier, customer, or\npersonal business. A conflict of interest can arise when an employee takes actions or has\ninterests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and\neffectively. A conflict of interest may also arise when an individual, or a member of his or her\nfamily, receives an improper personal benefit as a result of his or her position in, or relationship\nwith, the Company. Breach of confidentiality obligations can also give rise to a conflict of\ninterest. Moreover, the appearance of a conflict of interest alone can adversely affect the\nCompany and its relations with customers, suppliers, and employees.\nEmployees are expected to use good judgment, to adhere to high ethical standards, and to\navoid situations that create an actual or potential conflict of interest. It is almost always a\nconflict of interest for employees to work simultaneously for a competitor, customer, or supplier.\nA conflict of interest can also arise with respect to employment of relatives and persons\nwith close personal relationships. If an employee or someone with whom an employee has a\nclose relationship (e.g., a family member or close companion) has a financial or employment\nrelationship with an actual or potential competitor, supplier, or customer, the employee must\ndisclose this fact in writing to the head of finance or head of human resources of the Company.\nThe Company may take any action that it deems necessary in its sole discretion to avoid or\nremedy an actual, prospective or perceived conflict of interest, including a reassignment of some\nor all of the employee’s duties or change of the employee’s position.\nA conflict of interest may not always be clear, therefore, you should consult with higher\nlevels of management if you have any questions. Any employee who becomes aware of a\nconflict or a potential conflict should bring it to the attention of the head of finance or head of\nhuman resources of the Company.\n2\n4863-1429-8627.v5\nCorporate Opportunities\nYou must not take for yourself personally opportunities that are discovered through the\nuse of Company property or confidential information or your position with the Company without\nthe consent of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) or its designees. No employee may use\ncorporate property, information, or their position for improper personal gain, and no employee\nmay compete with the Company directly or indirectly while they are employed by the Company.\nYou owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so\narises.\nFair Dealing\nAlthough the prosperity of our Company depends on our ability to outperform our\ncompetitors, the Company is committed to achieving success by fair and ethical means. We seek\nto maintain a reputation for honesty and fair dealing among our competitors and the public alike.\nIn light of this aim, dishonest, unethical, or illegal business practices are prohibited, including,\nwithout limitation, corruption, bribery, kickbacks, extortion, embezzlement, or other similar\npractices. An exhaustive list of unethical practices cannot be provided. Instead, the Company\nrelies on the judgment of each individual to avoid such practices. Furthermore, each employee\nshould endeavor to deal fairly with the Company’s customers, suppliers, competitors, and\nemployees. No employee should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation,\nconcealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other\nunfair business practice.\nPayments or Gifts from Others\nUnder no circumstances may employees, officers, directors, agents, or contractors accept\nany offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization to pay any money, gift, or anything of value\nfrom customers, vendors, consultants, or others that is perceived as intended, directly or\nindirectly, to influence any business decision, any act or failure to act, any commitment of fraud,\nor opportunity for the commission of any fraud. Inexpensive gifts, infrequent business meals,\ncelebratory events, and entertainment, provided that they are not excessive or create an\nappearance of impropriety, do not violate this policy. Questions regarding whether a particular\npayment or gift violates this policy are to be directed to the head of finance or head of human\nresources of the Company.\nGifts given by the Company to suppliers or customers or received from suppliers or\ncustomers should always be appropriate to the circumstances and should never be of a kind that\ncould create an appearance of impropriety. The nature and cost must always be accurately\nrecorded in the Company’s books and records. You are expected to comply with the Company’s\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act Manual.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company strives to provide a safe and healthy work environment. All employees\nhave responsibility for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all other employees by\nfollowing the Company’s safety and health rules, policies and practices, and reporting accidents,\ninjuries, and unsafe equipment, practices, or conditions.\n3\n4863-1429-8627.v5\nInsider Trading\nYou are not permitted to use, share, or disseminate confidential information for stock\ntrading purposes or for any other purpose except the conduct of our business. To use\nconfidential information for personal financial benefit or to “tip” others who might make an\ninvestment decision on the basis of this information is not only unethical, but is also illegal. You\nare expected to comply with the Company’s Insider Trading and Communications Policy.\nProtection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nNo secret or unrecorded fund of Company assets or cash shall be established or\nmaintained for any purpose. Anyone spending or obligating Company funds should be certain\nthat the transaction is properly and appropriately documented and that the Company receives\nappropriate value in return.\nAll employees should endeavor to protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient\nuse. Theft, carelessness, and waste have a direct impact on the Company’s profitability. Any\nsuspected incident of fraud or theft should be immediately reported to the head of finance or\nhead of human resources of the Company for investigation. Company equipment should not be\nused for non-Company business, though incidental personal use may be permitted.\nRecord Keeping\nThe Company requires honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in\norder to make responsible business decisions. If you use a business expense account, expenses\nto be reimbursed must be documented and recorded accurately. If you are not sure whether an\nexpense is appropriate, ask your supervisor.\nAll of the Company’s books, records, accounts, and financial statements must be\nmaintained in reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Company’s transactions, and must\nconform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Company’s system of internal controls.\nAll Company business data, records, and reports must be prepared truthfully and accurately. The\nCompany’s business records must be maintained for the periods specified in the Company’s\napplicable record retention policies.\nEmployees who contribute to or prepare the Company’s financial statements, public\nfilings, submissions, or communications should do so in accordance with the following\nguidelines:\n• All accounting records, as well as reports produced from those records, must be\nprepared in accordance with the laws of each applicable jurisdiction.\n• All records must fairly and accurately reflect the transactions or occurrences to\nwhich they relate.\n• All records must fairly and accurately reflect, in reasonable detail, the Company’s\nassets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses.\n4\n4863-1429-8627.v5\n• The Company’s accounting records must not contain any false or intentionally\nmisleading entries.\n• No transactions should be intentionally misclassified as to accounts, departments,\nor accounting periods.\n• All transactions must be supported by accurate documentation in reasonable\ndetail and recorded in the proper account and in the proper accounting period.\n• No information should be concealed from independent auditors.\n• Compliance with the Company’s system of internal accounting controls is\nrequired.\nBusiness records and communications often become public, and employees should avoid\nexaggeration, derogatory remarks, guesswork, or inappropriate characterizations of people and\ncompanies that can be misunderstood. This applies equally to e-mail, internal memos, and\nformal reports.\nImplementation\nViolations of this Code or of any direction given by management in order to effect the\nprovisions, goals, and aims of this Code may result in disciplinary action, up to and including\ntermination of employment.\nWaiver\nAny waiver of this Code for executive officers or directors or any waiver of the Code of\nEthics for Senior Financial Officers may be made only by the Board, or a committee of the\nBoard responsible for corporate governance, and will be promptly disclosed as required by law.\nReporting Violations of this Code\nEmployees are responsible for being aware of the corporate policies applicable to their\nactivities and to comply with them fully. If you become aware of illegal activity, unethical\nbehavior, a violation of this Code, or believe that a violation may take place in the future, you\nmust promptly report the matter. Failure to report a known violation allows misconduct to go\nunremedied and is itself grounds for discipline. Ordinarily, the report may be made to the\nemployee’s immediate supervisor who, in turn, must report it to the head of finance or head of\nhuman resources of the Company. If the report pertains to concerns regarding questionable\naccounting or auditing matters, the employee should direct the report to the Chair of the Audit\nCommittee of the Board as described in the Company’s policy entitled “Procedures for the\nReporting of Questionable Accounting and Auditing Matters.”\nEmployees may report evidence of wrongdoing, complaints, or concerns relating to\naccounting and auditing matters to the Chair of the Audit Committee at any time. This report\n5\n4863-1429-8627.v5\nmay be made in person or in writing, and may be anonymous, at the employee’s discretion,\nthrough the following:\n• Contact the Chair of the Audit Committee by email at audit@atlanticcoastal.io.\n• Contact the Chair of the Audit Committee by mail at Atlantic Coastal Acquisition\nCorp. II, Attn: Audit Committee Chair, 6 St Johns Lane, Floor 5, New York, NY\n10013 (this correspondence will be forwarded directly to the Chair of the Audit\nCommittee).\n• Anonymous hotline at 1 (800) 759-0443.\nEmployees submitting a report on an anonymous basis are strongly encouraged to keep a\ncopy of the report (if made in writing) and a record of the time and date of their submission, as\nwell as a description of the matter as reported if the report was not in writing.\nEmployees are encouraged to provide as much specific information as possible, including\nnames, dates, places, and events that took place, relevant documents, and the employee’s\nperception of why the incident(s) may be misconduct.\nIf possible, the employee should provide a means by which she/he can be contacted in the\nevent that an investigator needs to follow-up or wants to report back to the employee.\nWe will not allow retaliation against an employee for reporting a possible violation of\nthis Code unless it can be shown that the report was knowingly false. Retaliation for reporting a\nfederal offense is illegal under federal law and prohibited under this Code. Such retaliation will\nresult in discipline up to and including termination of employment and may also result in\ncriminal prosecution. The employee is protected from retaliation even if the investigator does\nnot agree that there has been a violation. However, if the employee making the report was\ninvolved in improper activity, the fact that he or she reported it will not necessarily prevent him\nor her from being disciplined for his or her participation in the violation. In these circumstances,\nthe Company may consider the employee’s conduct in promptly reporting the information as a\nmitigating factor in any disciplinary decision.\nWhat to Do if You Have Questions or Are Unsure About a Transaction\nWe must all work to ensure prompt and consistent action against violations of this Code.\nHowever, in some situations, it is difficult to know right from wrong. Since we cannot anticipate\nevery situation that will arise, it is important that we have a way to approach a new question or\nproblem. These are the steps to keep in mind:\n• Always ask first, act later. If you are unsure of what to do in any situation, seek\nguidance from your supervisor or the head of finance or head of human resources\nof the Company before you act.\n• Make sure you have all the facts. In order to reach the right solutions, you must\nbe as fully informed as possible.\n6\n4863-1429-8627.v5\n• Ask yourself: What specifically am I being asked to do? Does it seem unethical\nor improper? This will enable you to focus on the specific question you are faced\nwith, and the alternatives you have. Use your judgment and common sense; if\nsomething seems unethical or improper, it probably is.\n• Discuss the problem with your supervisor. This is the basic guidance for all\nsituations. In many cases, your supervisor will be more knowledgeable about the\nquestion, and will appreciate being brought into the decision-making process.\n• Seek help from Company resources. In the event it is inappropriate to discuss an\nissue with your supervisor, or if you do not feel comfortable approaching your\nsupervisor with your question, you may also call the head of finance or head of\nhuman resources of the Company.\n• You may report ethical violations in confidence and without fear of retaliation. If\nyour situation requires that your identity be kept secret, your anonymity will be\nprotected.\n• If you have any questions or uncertainties regarding this Code or are unsure\nas to whether a transaction is consistent with this Code, please contact the\nhead of finance or head of human resources of the Company.\nAccountability for Adherence to this Code\nThe Board shall determine, or designate appropriate persons to determine, appropriate\nactions to be taken in the event of violations of this Code. The Chief Executive Officer of the\nCompany is currently so designated, and the Chief Executive Officer may designate the Chief\nFinancial Officer of the Company to determine actions to be taken in the event of a violation of\nthis Code as appropriate. Such actions shall be reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to\npromote accountability for adherence to this Code, and shall include written notices to the\nindividual involved that the Board or its designee has determined that there has been a violation,\nand may include censure by the Board or its designee, demotion or re-assignment of the\nindividual involved, suspension with or without pay (as determined by the Board or its designee),\nand termination of the individual’s employment or other service.\n7\n4863-1429-8627.v5\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nI have received and read the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. I\nunderstand the standards and policies contained in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct\nand Ethics and understand that there may be additional policies or laws specific to me depending\non my role with the Company. I further agree to comply with the Company’s Code of Business\nConduct and Ethics.\nIf I have questions concerning the meaning or application of the Company’s Code of\nBusiness Conduct and Ethics, any Company policies, or the legal and regulatory requirements\napplicable to my job, I know I can consult my manager or the head of finance or head of human\nresources of the Company, knowing that my questions or reports to these sources will be\nmaintained in confidence.\n_________________________________________\nName\n_________________________________________\nSignature\n_________________________________________\nDate\nPlease sign and return this form to the Human Resources Department.
