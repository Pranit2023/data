Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.6 million with diluted earnings per common share of $1.31, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net income was $6.2 million with diluted earnings per common share of $1.24.\n\nRobert Shuford, Jr., Chairman, President and CEO of the Company and Old Point National Bank (the \"Bank\") commented, \"Old Point delivered strong financial performance in the third quarter of 2024. We believe our commitment to prioritizing capital, asset quality, liquidity, and expense discipline continues to provide strong results for our shareholders. We saw meaningful growth in our deposit base and net interest income during the quarter. We view our balance sheet as well positioned to manage through these uncertain economic times while still allowing us to capitalize on growth opportunities across our footprint.\n\nExpenses incurred related to our cost saving initiatives were finalized in the third quarter. Through the third quarter, we incurred $997 thousand of one-time costs in an effort to reduce noninterest expenses. While these one-time costs have impacted our bottom-line in 2024, we continue to believe that these initiatives will reduce noninterest expense by approximately $5.0 million on an annualized pre-tax basis (excluding one-time costs) going forward. We feel we are well positioned for the remainder of the year and look forward to capitalizing on new opportunities and providing long-term value to our shareholders.\"\n\nKey highlights of the third quarter are as follows:\n\n  * Total assets were $1.5 billion at September 30, 2024, increasing $31.6 million or 2.2% from December 31, 2023. Net loans held for investment were $1.0 billion at September 30, 2024, decreasing $54.0 million, or 5.1%, from December 31, 2023.\n  * Total deposits increased $52.4 million, or 4.3%, from December 31, 2023.\n  * Return on average equity (ROE) was 8.39% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 9.43% for the second quarter of 2024, and 5.25% for the third quarter of 2023. Return on average assets (ROA) was 0.64% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 0.71% for the second quarter of 2024, and 0.37% for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Book value per share and tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) at September 30, 2024 increased 4.96% and 5.05%, from June 30, 2024 and 15.10% and 15.45%, respectively from September 30, 2023.\n  * Net income decreased $147 thousand, or 5.8%, to $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 from $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 and improved $1.0 million, or 74.9% from $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Net interest margin (NIM) was 3.56% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.62% for the second quarter of 2024 and 3.33% for the third quarter of 2023. NIM on a fully tax-equivalent basis (FTE) (non-GAAP) was 3.57% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.63% for the second quarter of 2024 and 3.35% for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Net interest income increased $194 thousand, or 1.6%, to $12.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 from $12.1 million for the second quarter of 2024 and increased $884 thousand, or 7.7%, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Provision for credit losses of $282 thousand was recognized for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $261 thousand for the second quarter of 2024 and $505 thousand for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Non-performing assets increased by $736 thousand to $2.7 million or 0.18% of total assets at September 30, 2024 from $2.0 million or 0.14% of total assets at June 30, 2024 and decreased $20 thousand from $2.7 million or 0.19% of total assets at September 30, 2023.\n  * Liquidity as of September 30, 2024, defined as cash and cash equivalents, unpledged securities, and available secured borrowing capacity, totaled $497.7 million, representing 33.7% of total assets compared to $342.5 million, representing 23.7% of total assets as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\nFor more information about financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\n\n**_Balance Sheet and Asset Quality_** Total assets of $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 increased $31.6 million from December 31, 2023. Net loans held for investment decreased $54.0 million, or 5.1% from December 31, 2023 to $1.0 billion at September 30, 2024, driven by the following: decreases in consumer loans of $31.4 million, construction loans of $16.8 million, commercial loans of $12.2 million, and commercial real estate loans of $3.5 million, partially offset by increases in residential real estate loans of $8.8 million. Securities available-for-sale, at fair value, decreased $8.4 million from December 31, 2023 to $193.8 million at September 30, 2024.\n\nTotal deposits of $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 increased $52.4 million, or 4.3%, from December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $21.1 million, or 6.4%, savings deposits increased $10.2 million, or 1.5%, and time deposits increased $21.1 million, or 8.7%. The increased deposit balances are primarily driven by increases from large commercial customers. Overnight repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and subordinated notes decreased $30.0 million to $71.5 million at September 30, 2024 from $101.5 million at December 31, 2023, as the Company used excess liquidity to pay down high-cost borrowed funds.\n\nThe Company's total stockholders' equity at September 30, 2024 increased $8.7 million, or 8.1%, from December 31, 2023 to $115.5 million. The increase was primarily driven by net income and lower unrealized losses in the market value of securities available-for-sale, which are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, partially offset by cash dividend payments. The unrealized loss in market value of securities available-for-sale was a result of increases in market interest rates since the securities were acquired, rather than credit quality issues. The Company does not expect these unrealized losses to affect the earnings or regulatory capital of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Bank remains well capitalized with a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 12.76% at September 30, 2024 as compared to 11.45% at December 31, 2023. The Bank's leverage ratio was 9.99% at September 30, 2024 as compared to 9.46% at December 31, 2023. \n\nNon-performing assets (NPAs) totaled $2.7 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $2.0 million at June 30, 2024, and $2.7 million as of September 30, 2023. NPAs as a percentage of total assets were 0.18% at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.14% at June 30, 2024, and 0.19% at September 30, 2023. Non-accrual loans were $85 thousand at September 30, 2024, an increase from $44 thousand at June 30, 2024, and a decrease from $1.9 million at September 30, 2023. The decrease in non-accrual loans from the prior year comparative quarter was related to the resolution of three relationships. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest increased $465 thousand to $909 thousand at September 30, 2024 from $444 thousand at June 30, 2024 and increased $112 thousand from $797 thousand at September 30, 2023. Repossessed assets were $1.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $1.5 million at June 30, 2024 and none at September 30, 2023. The increase in repossessed assets from the prior periods was driven by the resolution of certain loans that were previously past due.\n\nThe Company recognized a provision for credit losses of $282 thousand during the third quarter of 2024 compared to $261 thousand during the second quarter of 2024 and $505 thousand during the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 included a provision of $342 thousand for loans and a $60 thousand recovery for unfunded commitments. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) at September 30, 2024 was $11.9 million including an ACL on loans of $11.7 million and the allowance for unfunded commitments of $248 thousand. The decrease in the ACL on loans during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023 was due primarily to reduction in the size of the portfolio. The ACL on loans as a percentage of loans held for investment was 1.14% at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.12% at June 30, 2024, and 1.09% at September 30, 2023. Quarterly annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were 0.18% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 0.12% for the second quarter of 2024 and 0.09% for the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, asset quality remains strong. Management believes the level of the ACL is sufficient to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio; however, if elevated levels of risk are identified, the provision for credit losses may increase in future periods. \n\n**_Net Interest Income_** Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $12.3 million, an increase of $194 thousand, or 1.6%, from the prior quarter and $884 thousand, or 7.7%, from the third quarter of 2023. The increase from the linked quarter was due to higher average earning asset balances partially offset by lower average yields and higher average interest-bearing liabilities at higher average rates. The increase from the prior-year comparative quarter was due primarily to higher average earning asset balances at higher average yields partially offset by higher average rates on interest-bearing liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net interest income was $36.0 million and $36.3 million, respectively. The decrease from the prior-year comparative period was due to higher average-interest bearing liabilities at higher average rates, partially offset by higher average earning assets at higher average earning yields.\n\nNet Interest Margin (NIM) for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.56%, a decrease from 3.62% for the second quarter of 2024, and an increase from 3.33% for the prior year quarter. On a fully tax-equivalent basis (FTE) (non-GAAP), NIM was 3.57%, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.63% for the second quarter of 2024 and 3.35% for the third quarter of 2023. Average earning asset balances increased $12.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 with yields on average earning assets increasing 34 basis points due to deployment of liquidity into higher earning assets and the effects of the rising interest rate environment. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $8.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 with costs increasing 21 basis points. The higher interest cost of liabilities was primarily due to higher interest rates on money market and time deposits, partially offset by decreases in short term average FHLB advances during the period. During the first nine months of 2024, average earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities increased $27.4 million and $45.1 million, over the 2023 comparative period, respectively.\n\nAverage loans decreased $49.0 million, or 4.5%, for the third quarter compared to the same period of 2023. Average yields on loans and investment securities were 41 basis points and 7 basis points higher in the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to the effects of rising interest rates. The extent to which changing interest rates will ultimately affect the Company's NIM is uncertain. For more information about these FTE financial measures, please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" below.\n\n**_Noninterest Income_** Total noninterest income was $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $3.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $3.5 million for the comparative quarter of 2023. The $1 thousand increase during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter was primarily driven by increases in service charges on deposit accounts and smaller losses on sales of repossessed assets, partially offset by a decrease in other service charges, commissions and fees. The $10 thousand decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by decreases in mortgage banking income, partially offset by increases in fiduciary and asset management fees. Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $215 thousand to $10.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in mortgage banking income and no gain on sales of fixed assets, partially offset by increases in fiduciary and asset management fees and service charges on deposit accounts. The decrease in mortgage banking income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was due to declines in the volume of mortgage originations attributable to the Company's strategic shift in mortgage lending and changes in mortgage market conditions impacting the industry as a whole.\n\n**_Noninterest Expense_** Noninterest expense totaled $12.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $12.3 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $12.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in expenses from the linked quarter of $70 thousand was primarily related to increases in professional services, partially offset by decreases in occupancy and equipment and other operating expenses. The third quarter included the settlement of two outstanding legal matters for $240 thousand. Occupancy and equipment expenses decreased over the comparative period driven by the second quarter impairment of the right-of-use asset for the closure of the Crown Center branch. The decrease in expenses over the prior year quarter was primarily driven by decreases in salaries and employee benefit expense and other operating expenses, partially offset by increases in professional services. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by lower average headcount due to the cost saving initiatives. The noninterest expense reduction initiatives reduced the employee headcount late in the first quarter of 2024 and into the third quarter by approximately 12%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense decreased $775 thousand, or 2.0% over the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits as discussed above.\n\n**_Capital Management and Dividends_** For the third quarter of 2024, the Company declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, consistent with the third quarter of 2023. The dividend represents a payout ratio of 29.8% of earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024. The Board of Directors of the Company continually reviews the amount of cash dividends per share and the resulting dividend payout ratio in light of changes in economic conditions, current and future capital requirements, and expected future earnings.\n\nTotal consolidated equity increased $8.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, due primarily to net income and lower unrealized losses in the market value of securities available-for-sale, which are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, partially offset by cash dividend payments. The Company's securities available-for-sale are fixed income debt securities, and their unrealized loss position is a result of increases in market interest rates since the investments were acquired rather than credit quality issues. The Company expects to recover its investments in debt securities through scheduled payments of principal and interest and unrealized losses are not expected to affect the earnings or regulatory capital of the Company or its subsidiaries.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the book value per share of the Company's common stock was $22.74, and tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) was $22.38. For more information about non-GAAP financial measures, please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" below.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** In reporting the results as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has provided supplemental financial measures on a fully tax-equivalent, tangible, or adjusted basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are a supplement to GAAP, which is used to prepare the Company's financial statements, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein in its analysis of the Company's performance. The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods presented without the impact of items or events that may obscure trends in the Company's underlying performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company to evaluate and measure the Company's performance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is presented below.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements** Statements in this press release, including without limitation, statements made in Mr. Shuford's quotation , which use language such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends\" and similar expressions, may constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
