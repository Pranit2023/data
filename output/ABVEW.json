(Nasdaq: ABVE, ABVEW)\n(“Above Food” or the “Company”), an innovative food company leveraging its vertically integrated supply\nchain to deliver differentiated ingredients and consumer products, today announced additional details\nrelated to its expanded chickpea business in connection with its previously announced acquisition of the\nspecialty crop food ingredient division (the “Assets”) of Montana-based The Redwood Group, LLC (“TRG”).\nThis strategic acquisition solidifies Above Food's position as North America's largest chickpea\nmanufacturer, positioning the Company to capitalize on the growing global demand for plant-based proteins\nand meet increasing consumer preferences for sustainable, nutritious food options.\n“We are pleased to expand our presence in the rapidly growing global chickpea market. Together with our\nrecent acquisition, Above Food is now one of North America’s largest chickpea ingredient suppliers with a\nbusiness that now represents approximately US$62 million on an annualized basis or 14% of our combined\nrevenue on a proforma basis,” said Lionel Kambeitz, Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and\nExecutive Chairman of Above Food. “Our enhanced leadership in the chickpea sector aligns perfectly with\nour seed-to-fork platform, allowing us to control every step from seed selection and farming to ingredient\nprocessing and formulation, for conventional, natural regenerative, organic, and regenerative organic\ncertified chickpeas. By leveraging our expanded operations and increased processing capabilities, we are\nwell-positioned to meet the growing demand for plant-based proteins across human food, pet food, and\nexport markets. Furthermore, we are able to drive innovation in chickpea-based products, strengthen\nrelationships with growers and suppliers, and capture a larger share of the global chickpea trade. This\nstrategic move not only positions Above Food as the go-to partner for food manufacturers seeking high-\nquality, sustainable chickpea ingredients but also aligns perfectly with our mission to create a healthier\nworld — one seed, one field, and one bite at a time.”\nStrategic Importance of Leadership in Chickpea Industry\nThe chickpea industry represents a substantial and growing opportunity for Above Food, driven by several\nkey factors:\n Large and Growing Market: The US$15 billion global chickpea market is projected to grow at a CAGR\nof 7.4% through 2032, according to Zion Market Research. This growth outpaces many traditional\nprotein sources, indicating a shift towards plant-based protein options. Notably, Saskatchewan, is the\nprimary chickpea-producing province in Canada, accounting for approximately 80% of the country's\nproduction according to Saskatchewan Pulse Growers.\n Rising Consumer Demand: Chickpeas align perfectly with current consumer trends towards plant-\nbased proteins, healthy eating, and sustainability, with 39% of US consumers trying to incorporate\nmore plant-based foods in their diets. Chickpea’s nutritional density makes them an attractive option\nfor consumers seeking healthier food choices and for manufacturers developing new nutritious\nproduct formulations.\n Versatility Across Applications: Chickpeas are incredibly versatile ingredients used in human food,\npet food, and export markets. From traditional hummus and falafel to innovative meat alternatives,\ngluten-free flours, and plant-based dairy substitutes, chickpeas are used in a wide range of products.\nThis versatility provides Above Food with diverse revenue streams across high-growth categories,\ndriving demand and fueling ongoing product innovation.\n Sustainability Advantages: Chickpeas emerge as a frontrunner in sustainable agriculture, boasting a\nsignificantly lower environmental footprint compared to animal proteins. Their water-efficient\ncultivation, natural soil-enriching properties as nitrogen-fixers, and reduced carbon emissions align\nperfectly with the growing consumer demand for eco-friendly food options. These sustainability\ncredentials, coupled with chickpeas' role in promoting biodiversity and food security, position them as\na key ingredient for environmentally conscious consumers and manufacturers in the evolving\nlandscape of sustainable food systems.\n Innovation Opportunities: Above Food's enhanced chickpea processing capabilities open up new\navenues for product development and innovation in the plant-based protein sector, positioning the\nCompany at the forefront of emerging food technology trends. The number of new product launches\ncontaining chickpea as an ingredient increased by 74% globally between 2018 and 2022, according\nto the Mintel Global New Products Database.\nAbout Above Food\nAbove Food Ingredients Inc.

This growth is outpacing the\noverall pet food market, indicating a strong shift towards consumers adopting plant-based protein\nformulations for their pets.\n Expanding Pet Ownership: 66% of US households own a pet, according to the American Pet Products\nAssociation. The US pet population has been consistently growing at 1-2% annually from 2013-2022,\nas reported by Euromonitor. This trend is expected to continue, creating a steadily expanding\ncustomer base for pet food products.\n Pet Humanization Trend: According to Packaged Facts, 92-96% of US pet owners view their pets as\nfamily members.

(the “Company”) has adopted this Code of Conduct (the “Code”) to encourage\nas reasonably necessary:\n• Honest and ethical conduct, including fair dealing and the ethical handling of actual or\napparent conflicts of interest;\n• Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosures;\n• Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n• Prompt internal reporting of any violations of law or the Code;\n• Accountability for adherence to the Code, including fair process by which to determine\nviolations;\n• Consistent enforcement of the Code, including clear and objective standards for\ncompliance; and\n• Protection for persons reporting any such questionable behavior.\nAll directors, officers and employees (each a “Covered Party” and, collectively, the\n“Covered Parties”) of the Company and all of its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are\nexpected to be familiar with the Code and to adhere to the principles and procedures set forth\nbelow.\nI. Conflicts of Interest\nA conflict of interest occurs when the private interests of a Covered Party interfere, or\nappear to interfere, with the interests of the Company as a whole.\nFor example, a conflict of interest can arise when a Covered Party takes actions or has\npersonal interests that make it difficult to perform his or her Company duties objectively and\neffectively. A conflict of interest may also arise when a Covered Party, or a member of his or\nher immediate family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position at the\nCompany.1\nConflicts of interest can also occur indirectly. For example, a conflict of interest may\narise when a Covered Party is also an executive officer, a major shareholder or has a material\ninterest in a company or organization doing business with the Company.\n1 Item 404(a) of SEC Regulation S-K defines “immediate family member” as a person’s child, stepchild, parent,\nstepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-\nlaw, or any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the person’s household.\n1\nEach Covered Party has an obligation to conduct the Company’s business in an honest\nand ethical manner, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest\nbetween personal and professional relationships. Any situation that involves, or may reasonably\nbe expected to involve, a conflict of interest with the Company, should be disclosed promptly to\nthe Company’s Audit Committee of the Board.\nII. Disclosures\nThe information in the Company's public communications, including all reports and\ndocuments filed with or submitted to the SEC, must be full, fair, accurate, timely and\nunderstandable.\nTo ensure the Company meets this standard, all Covered Parties (to the extent they are\ninvolved in the Company’s disclosure process) are required to maintain familiarity with the\ndisclosure requirements, processes and procedures applicable to the Company commensurate\nwith their duties. Covered Parties are prohibited from knowingly misrepresenting, omitting or\ncausing others to misrepresent or omit, material facts about the Company to others, including the\nCompany’s independent auditors, governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.\nIII. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nThe Company is obligated to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. It is\nthe personal responsibility of each Covered Party to adhere to the standards and restrictions\nimposed by these laws, rules and regulations in the performance of his or her duties for the\nCompany.\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer or\nController (or persons performing similar functions) of the Company are also required to\npromote compliance by all employees with the Code and to abide by Company standards,\npolicies and procedures.\nIV. Reporting, Accountability and Enforcement\nThe Company promotes ethical behavior at all times and encourages Covered Parties to\ntalk to supervisors, managers and other appropriate personnel, including officers, the General\nCounsel, outside counsel for the Company and the Board or the relevant committee thereof,\nwhen in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation.\nCovered Parties should promptly report suspected violations of laws, rules, regulations or\nthe Code to appropriate personnel, including officers, the General Counsel, outside counsel for\nthe Company and the Board or the relevant committee thereof. Reports may be made\nanonymously. If requested, confidentiality will be maintained, subject to applicable law,\nregulations and legal proceedings.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board or other appropriate officer or body shall investigate\nand determine, or shall designate appropriate persons to investigate and determine, the\nlegitimacy of such reports. The Audit Committee or other appropriate officer or body will then\n2\ndetermine the appropriate disciplinary action. Such disciplinary action includes, but is not\nlimited to, reprimand, termination with cause, and possible civil and criminal prosecution.\nTo encourage employees to report any and all violations, the Company will not tolerate\nretaliation for reports made in good faith. Retaliation or retribution against any Covered Party\nfor a report made in good faith of any suspected violation of laws, rules, regulations or this Code\nis cause for appropriate disciplinary action.\nV. Waivers\nBefore an employee, or an immediate family member of any such employee, engages in\nany activity that would be otherwise prohibited by the Code, he or she is strongly encouraged to\nobtain a written waiver from the Audit Committee or, if the Audit Committee defers decision on\nsuch waiver to the Board, from the Board.\nBefore a director or executive officer, or an immediate family member of a director or\nexecutive officer, engages in any activity that would be otherwise prohibited by the Code, he or\nshe must obtain a written waiver from the Audit Committee or, if the Audit Committee defers\ndecision on such waiver to the Board, from the disinterested directors of the Board. Such waiver\nmust then be disclosed to the Company’s shareholders, along with the reasons for granting the\nwaiver, within four business days.\nVI. No Rights Created\nThis Code is a statement of certain fundamental principles, policies and procedures that\ngovern the Company’s Covered Parties in the conduct of the Company’s business. It is not\nintended to and does not create any rights in any employee, customer, client, visitor, supplier,\ncompetitor, shareholder or any other person or entity. It is the Company’s belief that the policy\nis robust and covers most conceivable situations.\n3"

          "content": "Above Food Ingredients Inc.\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy and Procedures\nU.S. federal and state laws prohibit trading in the securities of a company while in\npossession of material nonpublic information and in breach of a duty of trust or confidence.\nThese laws also prohibit anyone who is aware of material nonpublic information from providing\nthis information to others who may trade. Violating such laws can undermine investor trust,\nharm the reputation and integrity of Above Food Ingredients Inc. (together with its subsidiaries,\nthe “Company”), and result in dismissal from the Company or even serious criminal and civil\ncharges against the individual and the Company. The Company reserves the right to take\nwhatever disciplinary or other measure(s) it determines in its sole discretion to be appropriate in\nany particular situation, including disclosure of wrongdoing to governmental authorities.\nPersons Covered and Administration of Policy\nThis Insider Trading Compliance Policy and Procedures (this “Policy”) applies to all\nofficers, directors and employees of the Company. For purposes of this Policy, “officers” refer to\nthose individuals who meet the definition of “officer” under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934 (as amended, the “Exchange Act”). Individuals subject to this Policy are responsible\nfor ensuring that members of their household comply with this Policy. This Policy also applies to\nany entities controlled by individuals subject to the Policy, including any corporations, limited\nliability companies, partnerships or trusts, and transactions by these entities should be treated\nfor the purposes of this Policy as if they were for the individual’s own account. The Company\nmay determine that this Policy applies to additional persons with access to material nonpublic\ninformation, such as contractors or consultants. Officers, directors and employees, together with\nany other person designated as being subject to this Policy by the General Counsel or his or her\ndesignee (the “Compliance Officer”), are referred to collectively as “Covered Persons.”\nQuestions regarding the Policy should be directed to the Compliance Officer, who is\nresponsible for the administration of this Policy.\nPolicy Statement\nNo Covered Person shall purchase or sell any type of security while in possession of\nmaterial nonpublic information relating to the security or the issuer of such security in breach of\na duty of trust or confidence, whether the issuer of such security is the Company or any other\ncompany. In addition, if a Covered Person is in possession of material nonpublic information\nabout other publicly-traded companies, such as suppliers, customers, competitors or potential\nacquisition targets, the Covered Person may not trade in such other companies’ securities until\nthe information becomes public or is no longer material. Further, no Covered Person shall\npurchase or sell any security of any other company, including another company in the Company’s\nindustry, while in possession of material nonpublic information if such information is obtained in\nthe course of the Covered Person’s employment or service with the Company.\nIn addition, Covered Persons shall not directly or indirectly communicate material\nnonpublic information to anyone outside the Company (except in accordance with the\nCompany’s policies regarding confidential information) or to anyone within the Company other\nthan on a “need-to-know” basis.\n“Securities” includes common shares, bonds, notes, debentures, options, warrants,\nequity and other convertible securities, as well as derivative instruments.\n“Purchase” and “sale” are defined broadly under the U.S. federal securities law.\n“Purchase” includes not only the actual purchase of a security, but also any contract to purchase\nor otherwise acquire a security. “Sale” includes not only the actual sale of a security, but also\nany contract to sell or otherwise dispose of a security. These definitions extend to a broad range\nof transactions, including conventional cash-for-stock transactions, conversions, the exercise of\nstock options, transfers, gifts, and acquisitions and exercises of warrants or puts, calls, pledging\nand margin loans, or other derivative securities.\nThe laws and regulations concerning insider trading are complex, and Covered Persons\nare encouraged to seek guidance from the Compliance Officer prior to considering a transaction\nin Company securities.\nBlackout Periods\nNo director, officer or employee listed on Schedule I, as amended from time to time, (as\nwell as any individual or entity covered by this Policy by virtue of their relationship to such\ndirector, officer or employee) shall purchase or sell any security of the Company during the period\nbeginning on the 15th calendar day of the last month of any fiscal quarter of the Company and\nending after completion of the second full trading day after the public release of earnings data\nfor such fiscal quarter or during any other trading suspension period declared by the Company,\nsuch period, a “blackout period.” A “trading day” is a day on which U.S. national stock exchanges\nare open for trading. If, for example, the Company were to make an announcement on Monday\nprior to 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, then the blackout period would terminate after the close of\ntrading on Tuesday. If an announcement were made on Monday after 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time,\nthen the blackout period would terminate after the close of trading on Wednesday. If you have\nany question as to whether information is publicly available, please direct an inquiry to the\nCompliance Officer.\nThese prohibitions do not apply to:\n• purchases of the Company’s securities from the Company, or sales of the\nCompany’s securities to the Company;\n• exercises of stock options or other equity awards or the surrender of shares to the\nCompany in payment of the exercise price or in satisfaction of any tax withholding\nobligations in a manner permitted by the applicable equity award agreement, or\nvesting of equity-based awards, in each case, that do not involve a market sale of\n2\nthe Company’s securities (the “cashless exercise” of a Company stock option or\nother equity award through a broker does involve a market sale of the Company’s\nsecurities, and therefore would not qualify under this exception);\n• bona fide gifts of the Company’s securities, unless the individual making the gift\nknows, or is reckless in not knowing, the recipient intends to sell the securities\nwhile the donor is in possession of material nonpublic information about the\nCompany; or\n• purchases or sales of the Company’s securities made pursuant to a plan adopted\nto comply with the Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 (“Rule 10b5-1”).\nExceptions to the blackout period policy may be approved by the Compliance Officer or,\nin the case of exceptions for directors, the Board of Directors.\nFrom time to time, the Compliance Officer may require that directors, officers, employees\nor others suspend trading in Company securities because of developments that have not yet been\ndisclosed to the public. When such event-specific blackout periods occur, those subject to it will\nbe notified by the Company. The event-specific blackout period will not be announced to those\nnot subject to it, and those subject to it or otherwise aware of it should not disclose it to others.\nEven if the Company has not notified you that you are subject to an event-specific\nblackout period, if you are aware of material nonpublic information about the Company, you\nshould not trade in Company securities. Any failure by the Company to designate you as subject\nto an event-specific blackout period, or to notify you of such designation, does not relieve you of\nyour obligation not to trade in the Company’s securities while possessing material nonpublic\ninformation. Subject to the exceptions noted above, all of those individuals affected should not\ntrade in the Company’s securities while the suspension is in effect, and should not disclose to\nothers that the Company has suspended trading.\nPreclearance of Trades by Directors, Officers and Employees\nAll transactions in the Company’s securities by directors, officers, and employees listed\non Schedule II (each, a “Preclearance Person”) must be precleared by the Compliance Officer or\nthe Chief Financial Officer for transactions by the Compliance Officer. Preclearance should not\nbe understood to represent legal advice by the Company that a proposed transaction complies\nwith the law.\nA request for preclearance must be in writing, should be made at least two business days\nin advance of the proposed transaction, and should include the identity of the Preclearance\nPerson, a description of the proposed transaction, the proposed date of the transaction, and the\nnumber of shares or other securities involved. In addition, the Preclearance Person must execute\na certification that he or she is not aware of material nonpublic information about the Company.\nThe Compliance Officer, or the Chief Financial Officer for transactions by the Compliance Officer,\nshall have sole discretion to decide whether to clear any contemplated transaction. All trades\n3\nthat are precleared must be effected within five business days of receipt of the preclearance. A\nprecleared trade (or any portion of a precleared trade) that has not been effected during the five\nbusiness day period must be submitted for preclearance determination again prior to execution.\nNotwithstanding receipt of preclearance, if the Preclearance Person becomes aware of material\nnonpublic information, or becomes subject to a blackout period before the transaction is\neffected, the transaction may not be completed. Transactions under a previously established\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plan that has been preapproved in accordance with this Policy are not\nsubject to further preclearance.\nNone of the Company, the Compliance Officer, or the Company’s other employees will\nhave any liability for any delay in reviewing, or refusal of, a request for preclearance.\nMaterial Nonpublic Information\nInformation is considered “material” if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable\ninvestor would consider it important in making a decision to buy, sell, or hold a security, or if the\ninformation is likely to have a significant effect on the market price of the security. Material\ninformation can be positive or negative, and can relate to virtually any aspect of a company’s\nbusiness or to any type of security, debt, or equity. Also, information that something is likely to\nhappen in the future—or even just that it may happen—could be deemed material.\nExamples of material information may include (but are not limited to) information about:\n• corporate earnings or earnings forecasts;\n• possible mergers, acquisitions, tender offers, or dispositions;\n• major new products or product developments;\n• important business developments, such as developments regarding strategic\ncollaborations or partnerships;\n• management or control changes;\n• significant financing developments including pending public sales or offerings of debt\nor equity securities;\n• defaults on borrowings;\n• bankruptcies;\n• cybersecurity or data security incidents; and\n• significant litigation or regulatory actions.\nMoreover, material information does not have to be related to a company’s business. For\nexample, the contents of a forthcoming news article that is expected to affect the market price\nof a security can be material. Information is “nonpublic” if it is not available to the general public.\nIn order for information to be considered “public,” it must be widely disseminated in a manner\nthat makes it generally available to investors in a U.S. Regulation FD-compliant method, such as\n4\nthrough a press release, a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or a U.S.\nRegulation FD-compliant conference call. The Compliance Officer shall have sole discretion to\ndecide whether information is public for purposes of this Policy.\nThe circulation of rumors, even if accurate and reported in the media, does not constitute\npublic dissemination. In addition, even after a public announcement, a reasonable period of time\nmay need to lapse in order for the market to react to the information. Generally, the passage of\ntwo full trading days following release of the information to the public, is a reasonable waiting\nperiod before such information is deemed to be public.\nPost-Termination Transactions\nIf an individual is in possession of material nonpublic information when the individual’s\nservice terminates, the individual may not trade in the Company’s securities until that\ninformation has become public or is no longer material.\nProhibited Transactions\nThe Company has determined that there is a heightened legal risk and the appearance of\nimproper or inappropriate conduct if persons subject to this Policy engage in certain types of\ntransactions. Therefore, Covered Persons shall comply with the following policies with respect\nto certain transactions in the Company’s securities.\nShort Sales\nShort sales of the Company’s securities are prohibited by this Policy. Short sales of the\nCompany’s securities, or sales of shares that the insider does not own at the time of sale, or sales\nof shares against which the insider does not deliver the shares within 20 days after the sale, evidence\nan expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value, and, therefore,\nsignal to the market that the seller has no confidence in the Company or its short-term prospects.\nOptions\nTransactions in puts, calls, or other derivative securities involving the Company’s equity\nsecurities, on an exchange, on an over-the-counter market, or in any other organized market, are\nprohibited by this Policy. A transaction in options is, in effect, a bet on the short-term movement\nof the Company’s common shares and, therefore, creates the appearance that a Covered Person\nis trading based on material nonpublic information. Transactions in options, whether traded on\nan exchange, on an over-the-counter market, or any other organized market, also may focus a\nCovered Person’s attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company’s long-\nterm objectives.\nHedging Transactions\nHedging transactions involving the Company’s securities, such as prepaid variable forward\ncontracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds, or other transactions that hedge or offset,\n5\nor are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value of the Company’s equity\nsecurities, are prohibited by this Policy. Such transactions allow the Covered Person to continue\nto own the covered securities, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that\noccurs, the Covered Person may no longer have the same objectives as the Company’s other\nshareholders.\nMargin Accounts and Pledging\nIndividuals are prohibited from pledging Company securities as collateral for a\nloan, purchasing Company securities on margin (i.e., borrowing money to purchase the\nsecurities), or placing Company securities in a margin account. This prohibition does not apply\nto cashless exercises of stock options under the Company’s equity plans, nor to situations\napproved in advance by the Compliance Officer.\nPartnership Distributions\nNothing in this Policy is intended to limit the ability of an investment fund, venture capital\npartnership or other similar entity with which a director is affiliated to distribute Company\nsecurities to its partners, members, or other similar persons. It is the responsibility of each\naffected director and the affiliated entity, in consultation with their own counsel (as appropriate),\nto determine the timing of any distributions, based on all relevant facts and circumstances, and\napplicable securities laws.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nThe trading restrictions set forth in this Policy, other than those transactions described\nunder “Prohibited Transactions,” do not apply to transactions under a previously established\ncontract, plan or instruction to trade in the Company’s securities entered into in accordance with\nRule 10b5-1 (a “Trading Plan”) that:\n• has been submitted to and preapproved by the Compliance Officer;\n• includes a “Cooling Off Period” for\ndirectors and officers that extends to the later of 90 days after adoption or\no\nmodification of a Trading Plan or two business days after filing the Form\n20-F or Form 6-K disclosing financial results covering the fiscal quarter in\nwhich the Trading Plan was adopted, up to a maximum of 120 days; and\nemployees and any other persons, other than the Company, that extends\no\n30 days after adoption or modification of a Trading Plan;\n• for directors and officers, includes a representation in the Trading Plan that the\ndirector or officer is (1) not aware of any material nonpublic information about\nthe Company or its securities; and (2) adopting the Trading Plan in good faith and\nnot as part of a plan or scheme to evade Rule 10b-5;\n6\n• has been entered into in good faith at a time when the individual was not in\npossession of material nonpublic information about the Company and not\notherwise in a blackout period, and the person who entered into the Trading Plan\nhas acted in good faith with respect to the Trading Plan;\n• either (1) specifies the amounts, prices, and dates of all transactions under the\nTrading Plan; or (2) provides a written formula, algorithm, or computer program\nfor determining the amount, price, and date of the transactions, and (3) prohibits\nthe individual from exercising any subsequent influence over the transactions; and\n• complies with all other applicable requirements of Rule 10b5-1.\nThe Compliance Officer may impose such other conditions on the implementation and\noperation of the Trading Plan as the Compliance Officer deems necessary or advisable.\nIndividuals may not adopt more than one Trading Plan at a time except under the limited\ncircumstances permitted by Rule 10b5-1 and subject to preapproval by the Compliance Officer.\nAn individual may only modify a Trading Plan outside of a blackout period and, in any\nevent, when the individual does not possess material nonpublic information. Modifications to\nand terminations of a Trading Plan are subject to preapproval by the Compliance Officer and\nmodifications of a Trading Plan that change the amount, price, or timing of the purchase or sale\nof the securities underlying a Trading Plan will trigger a new Cooling-Off Period.\nThe Company reserves the right to publicly disclose, announce, or respond to inquiries\nfrom the media regarding the adoption, modification, or termination of a Trading Plan and non-\nRule 10b5-1 trading arrangements, or the execution of transactions made under a Trading Plan.\nThe Company also reserves the right from time to time to suspend, discontinue, or otherwise\nprohibit transactions under a Trading Plan if the Compliance Officer or the Board of Directors, in\nits discretion, determines that such suspension, discontinuation, or other prohibition is in the\nbest interests of the Company.\nCompliance of a Trading Plan with the terms of Rule 10b5-1 and the execution of\ntransactions pursuant to the Trading Plan are the sole responsibility of the person initiating the\nTrading Plan, and none of the Company, the Compliance Officer, or the Company’s other\nemployees assumes any liability for any delay in reviewing and/or refusing to approve a Trading\nPlan submitted for approval, nor the legality or consequences relating to a person entering into,\ninforming the Company of, or trading under, a Trading Plan.\nInterpretation, Amendment, and Implementation of this Policy\nThe Compliance Officer shall have the authority to interpret and update this Policy and all\nrelated policies and procedures. In particular, such interpretations and updates of this Policy, as\nauthorized by the Compliance Officer, may include amendments to or departures from the terms\nof this Policy, to the extent consistent with the general purpose of this Policy and applicable\nsecurities laws.\n7\nActions taken by the Company, the Compliance Officer, or any other Company personnel\ndo not constitute legal advice, nor do they insulate you from the consequences of noncompliance\nwith this Policy or with securities laws.\nCertification of Compliance\nAll directors, officers, employees and others subject to this Policy may be asked\nperiodically to certify their compliance with the terms and provisions of this Policy.\n8\nSchedule I\nIndividuals Subject to Quarterly Trading Blackouts\nAll Directors\nAll Executive Officers\nExternal Financial Reporting Manager\nAccounting Assistance\nExecutive Administrator\nDirector of Operations, Ingredients & CPG\nOperations Coordinator\nCompliance Officer and legal team\nAll Investor Relations representatives\n9\nSchedule II\nIndividuals Subject to Preclearance Requirement\nAll Directors\nAll Executive Officers\nExternal Financial Reporting Manager\nAccounting Assistance\nExecutive Administrator\nDirector of Operations, Ingredients & CPG\nOperations Coordinator\nCompliance Officer and legal team\nAll Investor Relations representatives\n10"

          "content": "ABOVE FOOD INGREDIENTS INC.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTION POLICY\nI. Policy\nAbove Food Ingredients Inc. (the “Company”) recognizes that related party transactions\npresent a heightened risk of conflicts of interest (or the perception thereof), and therefore the\nCompany has adopted this policy (the “Policy”) pursuant to which all Related Party Transactions\n(as defined below) shall be subject to approval or ratification in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in this Policy.\nFor the purposes of this Policy, so long as the Company remains a “foreign private issuer”\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), a “Related Party\nTransaction” is an existing or proposed transaction or loan between the Company and:\n1. enterprises that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,\ncontrol or are controlled by, or are under common control with, the\nCompany;\n2. associates;\n3. individuals owning, directly or indirectly, an interest in the voting power\nof the Company that gives them significant influence over the Company,\nand close members of any such individual’s family;\n4. key management personnel, that is, those persons having authority and\nresponsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the\nCompany, including directors and senior management of companies and\nclose members of such individuals’ families; and\n5. enterprises in which a substantial interest in the voting power is owned,\ndirectly or indirectly, by any person described in (3) or (4) or over which\nsuch a person is able to exercise significant influence. This includes\nenterprises owned by directors or major shareholders of the Company and\nenterprises that have a member of key management in common with the\nCompany.\nFor the purposes of this Policy, each of the above is a “Related Party.”\nII. Procedures\nA. Identification of Related Party Transactions\nThe Company reviews all known transactions, arrangements and relationships in which the\nCompany and a Related Party are or will be participants to determine whether such transactions,\narrangements and relationships constitute Related Party Transactions. The Company’s finance\nteam is primarily responsible for developing and implementing processes and procedures to\nobtain information regarding Related Parties with respect to potential Related Party Transactions\nand then determining, based on the facts and circumstances, whether such potential Related Party\n1\nTransactions do, in fact, constitute Related Party Transactions requiring compliance with this\nPolicy. In addition, any potential Related Party Transaction that is proposed to be entered into by\nthe Company must be reported to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (or his or her designee)\nby both the Related Party and the person at the Company responsible for such potential Related\nParty Transaction.\nB. Audit Committee Approval\nIf the Company’s finance team determines that a transaction or relationship is a Related Party\nTransaction, then the Chief Financial Officer (or his or her designee) shall present to the Audit\nCommittee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) each such\nRelated Party Transaction, including all relevant known facts and circumstances relating thereto.\nThe Committee shall review the relevant known facts and circumstances of each Related Party\nTransaction, including whether the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be\nobtained in arm’s length dealings with an unrelated third party, whether the transaction arose in\nthe ordinary course of business, and the extent of the Related Party’s interest in the transaction,\ntaking into account the conflicts of interest and corporate opportunity provisions of the Company’s\norganizational documents and Code of Conduct (the “Code”), and either approve or disapprove\nthe Related Party Transaction. Any Related Party Transaction may be consummated and may\ncontinue only if the Committee has approved or ratified such transaction in accordance with the\nguidelines set forth in this Policy. If advance Committee approval of a Related Party Transaction\nrequiring the Committee’s approval is not feasible, then the transaction may be preliminarily\nentered into by management upon prior approval of the transaction by the Chairperson of the\nCommittee subject to ratification of the transaction by the Committee at the Committee’s next\nregularly scheduled meeting; provided that if ratification shall not be forthcoming, management\nshall make all reasonable efforts to cancel or annul such transaction. If a transaction was not\ninitially recognized as a Related Party Transaction, then upon such recognition the transaction will\nbe presented to the Committee for ratification at the Committee’s next regularly scheduled\nmeeting; provided, that if ratification shall not be forthcoming, management shall make all\nreasonable efforts to cancel or annul such transaction.\nManagement shall update the Committee as to any material changes to any approved or\nratified Related Party Transaction and shall provide a status report at least annually at a regularly\nscheduled meeting of the Committee of all then current Related Party Transactions.\nNo director may participate in approval of a Related Party Transaction for which he or she\nis a Related Party.\nC. Pre-Approved Transactions\nThe Committee has reviewed and pre-approved each of the following types of Related Party\nTransactions, which shall be deemed to be approved or ratified, as applicable, under this Policy:\n1. Compensation to an executive officer or director of the Company if the compensation\nis required to be reported in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F and such\ncompensation has been approved, or recommended to the Board for approval, by the\nCompensation Committee of the Board.\n2\n2. Transactions that are in the Company’s ordinary course of business and where the\ninterest of the Related Party arises only:\na. from the Related Party’s position as a director of another corporation or\norganization that is a party to the transaction; or\nb. from the direct or indirect ownership by such Related Party and all other Related\nParties, in the aggregate, of less than a 10% equity interest in another person\n(other than a partnership) that is a party to the transaction; or\nc. from both such positions described in (a) and such ownership described in (b);\nor\nd. from the Related Party’s position as a limited partner in a partnership in which\nthe Related Party and all other Related Parties, in the aggregate, have an interest\nof less than 10%, and the Related Party is not a general partner of and does not\nhave another position in the partnership.\n3. Transactions that are in the Company’s ordinary course of business and where the\ninterest of the Related Party arises solely from the ownership of a class of equity\nsecurities in the Company and all holders of such class of equity securities of the\nCompany will receive the same benefit on a pro rata basis.\n4. Transactions where the rates or charges involved in the transactions are determined by\ncompetitive bids.\n5. Transactions where a Related Party purchases or sells any securities of the Company\nin a transaction involving a registered broker-dealer, including without limitation an\nunderwritten offering or at-the-market offering, that is approved by the Board or a\ncommittee of the Board.\nD. Disclosure\nAll Related Party Transactions are to be disclosed in the Company’s applicable filings as\nrequired by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act and related rules, and\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification Topic\n850, “Related Party Disclosures.” Furthermore, any material Related Party Transaction shall be\ndisclosed to the full Board.\nThe Company may be required to disclose additional information regarding Related Party\nTransactions if such information: (1) has otherwise been made publicly available or (2) must be\ndisclosed in accordance with Canadian law.\nE. Other Agreements\nManagement shall assure that all Related Party Transactions are not in violation of, and\nare approved in accordance with, any requirements of the Company’s financing or other material\nagreements.\n3\nF. Interpretation\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Policy shall be interpreted in such a\nmanner as to comply with Item 7.B. of Form 20-F and FASB Accounting Standards Codification\nTopic 850. In the event that a Related Party Transaction would constitute a conflict of interest or\na corporate opportunity under the Code, the provisions of the Code also shall apply to such\nRelated Party Transaction. Any such Related Party Transaction may not be approved hereunder\nunless it is also approved in accordance with the provisions of the Code and disclosed to the\npublic to the extent required by law or the rules of the principal market on which the Company’s\nordinary shares are traded.\nIII. Definitions\nAn “associate” is an unconsolidated enterprise in which the Company has a significant\ninfluence or which has significant influence over the Company. Significant influence over an\nenterprise is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the\nenterprise but is less than control over those policies. Shareholders beneficially owning a 10%\ninterest in the voting power of the Company are presumed to have a significant influence on the\nCompany.\n“Close members of an individual’s family” are those that may be expected to influence, or\nbe influenced by, that person in their dealings with the Company.\n4"
