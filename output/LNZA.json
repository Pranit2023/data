(NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech” or the “Company”), the carbon recycling company transforming waste carbon into sustainable fuels, chemicals, materials, and protein, today reported its financial and operating results for third-quarter 2024, updated its outlook for 2024, and discussed the expansion of its business model beyond licensing its biorefining technology to include more ethanol product sales and increased involvement in the ownership of the Company’s biorefining value chain.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n  * Announced a two-stage ethanol off-take agreement with ArcelorMittal S.A. (“ArcelorMittal”), a biorefining licensee of the Company, including off-take contracts for one-year and five-year terms\n  * Announced Project Drake, a 30 million gallon per year, EU-based, ethanol-to-sustainable aviation fuel project in tandem with the payment of a non-refundable fee in consideration for the Company’s grant of exclusivity to a new aviation infrastructure-focused financial partner with the intent of finalizing a financing commitment by the end of 2024\n  * Reported revenue of $9.9 million for third-quarter 2024 as compared to revenue of $17.4 million and $19.6 million for second-quarter 2024 and third-quarter 2023, respectively. Sequential decrease driven by timing delay in anticipated LanzaJet, Inc. (“LanzaJet”) sublicensing event that was expected to result in approximately $8.0 million of licensing revenue. Year-over-year decrease driven primarily by higher engineering services revenue related to a specific project being completed in third-quarter 2023\n  * Provided details on wide-range of potential financial outcomes for fourth-quarter 2024 based on several sizeable initiatives underway with varying degrees of timing uncertainty\n  * Expanding business model to complement licensing business by developing and financing more of LanzaTech's own projects with infrastructure capital partners, which enables LanzaTech to potentially own more of the biorefining value chain, including greater involvement with produced ethanol\n  * Actively evaluating material cost reduction opportunities as well as opportunities to reallocate resources to focus on and accelerate commercial activities\n\n\n\n“From a financial point of view, third-quarter 2024 ended on a disappointing note, with LanzaTech missing our financial targets due primarily to a timing delay related to a LanzaJet sublicensing event we were expecting, and to a lesser degree, softer ethanol pricing in a key fuel trading market of ours,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer of LanzaTech. “That aside, we have steadily made commercial progress during the second half of this year, and have much to accomplish during the remainder of the fourth quarter, and beyond. Today, we are announcing our first long-term committed off-take agreement with a licensee, ArcelorMittal, and the advancement of Project Drake, a sizeable sustainable aviation fuel opportunity that we believe positions us for greater upside as compared to a pure licensing arrangement. As we work to increase our ethanol sales business and widen our project ownership and operating scope, so too are we working to expand our business model’s revenue drivers. By controlling more feedstock, operations, and off-take in our business portfolio, we are building multiple pathways to cash flow generation and are working to accelerate our timeline to profitability.”\n\n**Third-Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nThe table below outlines key reported third-quarter 2024 results:\n\n_$ millions, unless noted_| **3Q24**| **3Q23**  \n---|---|---  \nRevenue| 9.9| 19.6  \nCost of revenue| 8.1| 14.4  \nGross Profit| 1.8| 5.2  \nOperating expenses| 34.8| 29.8  \nNet loss| (57.4| )| (25.3| )  \nAdjusted EBITDA loss (1)| (27.1| )| (19.1| )  \n  \n(1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliations of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA” sections herein for an explanation and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used throughout this release.\n\n**Revenue**\n\n  * Third-quarter 2024 revenue was $9.9 million as compared to $17.4 million and $19.6 million for second-quarter 2024 and third-quarter 2023, respectively. The sequential decrease was driven by a timing delay in LanzaJet signing its next sublicensing agreement, which we had forecasted would have resulted in approximately $8.0 million of licensing revenue during third-quarter 2024. The year-over-year decrease was predominantly related to particularly high third-quarter 2023 engineering services revenue reported for a specific project, Project Dragon, that was completed during third-quarter 2023. Going forward, LanzaTech expects to monetize previous work completed for Project Drake as well as execute further engineering work needed for Project Drake, Project SECURE, and other projects in the biorefining pipeline.\n  * Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) & Contract Research revenue for third-quarter 2024 was $1.8 million as compared to $2.8 million and $4.9 million for second-quarter 2024 and third-quarter 2023, respectively. The sequential and year-over-year decline was attributable to a few government projects being completed and a period of downtime being experienced prior to new projects commencing. LanzaTech announced Project ADAPT government funding in October 2024, and the Company expects to receive at least one other contract prior to the end of fourth-quarter 2024.\n  * CarbonSmart™ revenue for third-quarter 2024 was $2.2 million as compared to $0.9 million and $2.3 million for second-quarter 2024 and third-quarter 2023, respectively. Third-quarter 2024 was flat year-over-year, and the quarter-over-quarter increase as compared to second-quarter 2024 was driven by incremental direct fuel sales as a result of establishing licensing arrangements, partners, and supply chain infrastructure during second-quarter 2024. \n\n\n\n**Cost of Revenue**\n\n  * Third-quarter 2024 cost of revenue was $8.1 million as compared to $5.5 million and $14.4 million for second-quarter 2024 and third-quarter 2023, respectively. Cost of revenue for third-quarter 2024 was largely comprised of cost of CarbonSmart product sold and headcount allocations related to the delivery of our biorefining services and JDA work. Gross margin for third-quarter 2024 was 18% largely as a function of revenue mix, including additional lower margin CarbonSmart sales and excluded the improvement related to the LanzaJet sublicense transaction that benefited our results in second-quarter 2024. \n\n\n\n**Operating Expenses**\n\n  * Third-quarter 2024 operating expenses were $34.8 million as compared to $34.7 million and $29.8 million for second-quarter 2024 and third-quarter 2023. Sequentially, operating costs were flat, but the increase year-over-year was driven primarily by project-related expenses, like those incurred for LanzaTech’s project in Norway, that are expected to be recovered once the projects advance to Final Investment Decision (“FID”). \n\n\n\n**Net Loss**\n\n  * Third-quarter 2024 net loss was $(57.4) million as compared to second-quarter 2024 and third-quarter 2023 net loss of $(27.8) million and $(25.3) million, respectively. The sequential and year-over-year increase was attributable to a non-cash expense on financial instruments, as well as the same factors that drove the reduction in revenue as compared to prior periods. \n\n\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA Loss**\n\n  * Third-quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA loss was $(27.1) million as compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of $(17.8) million and $(19.1) million for second-quarter 2024 and third-quarter 2023, respectively. The increase in loss both sequentially and year-over-year is mainly attributable to the same factors that drove the reduction in revenue for the comparative periods. \n\n\n\n**Recent Commercial Highlights**\n\nLanzaTech continues to steadily execute on its commercial strategy, with a number of noteworthy achievements announced recently:\n\n  * Entered into a two-stage ethanol off-take agreement with ArcelorMittal, a biorefining licensee of the Company, which includes a one-year contract with potential revenue contribution of $6.0 million, and a five-year contract with annual volume commitments of 5,000 to 10,000 tons, with the potential to generate $10.0 million to $20.0 million in annual revenue. This is LanzaTech’s first long-term ethanol purchase agreement, which the Company expects will enhance access to product and will permit our CarbonSmart customers to make longer, larger commitments.\n  * Advanced Project Drake, a 30 million gallon per year, EU-based, ethanol-to-sustainable aviation fuel project that LanzaTech has been developing over the last three years. The facility is designed to utilize ethanol from LanzaTech’s waste-to-ethanol technology platform and convert it to SAF via the LanzaJet platform. The front-end engineering and design work for inside the battery limits of this project has been completed and it is expected to reach FID during 2025. LanzaTech has entered into an exclusivity agreement with a new financial partner whereby the partner intends to acquire certain rights in the development of this project, fund the remaining capital needed to reach FID, and enter into a development services agreement with LanzaTech for the remaining work. LanzaTech expects to maintain significant upside participation in this project, and is receiving the first $5 million in fees associated with this agreement.\n  * Progressed a sizeable project in Norway, in collaboration with Eramet, which is expected to reach FID within the next six months, and which is expected to be the first project to be developed with infrastructure capital partner, Brookfield Asset Management (“Brookfield”). Brookfield, as part of a framework agreement signed in October of 2022, has committed to invest $500 million in such LanzaTech projects that meet its investment criteria.\n  * Announced the expansion of the Company's biorefining capabilities to produce a single-cell protein called LanzaTech Nutritional Protein. The estimated $1 trillion alternative protein market is expected to grow significantly, and the Company's nutrient-rich product is designed to be a suitable ingredient for animal feed, pet food, and human nutrition that can be produced from CO2, oxygen and hydrogen anywhere in the world. LanzaTech's bioreactors have been producing protein as a co-product to ethanol for years, and now the Company has developed the capability to produce protein as the primary product.\n  * Added eight projects to the early-stage engineering phase of the Company’s project development pipeline. In September 2024, LanzaTech announced the signing of a master licensing agreement with SEKISUI which resulted in a related project being moved out of the advanced engineering stage and into the stage where an FID evaluation package is being prepared. Additionally, LanzaTech advanced its project with NTPC in India into the post-FID and construction phase, and continues to expect that several additional projects currently in advanced engineering will achieve FID and move into the construction phase over the next 12 months. \n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, LanzaTech had $89.1 million in total cash, restricted cash, and investments, compared to total cash of $75.8 million at the end of second-quarter 2024. The sequential increase in cash is attributable to the $40 million capital raise LanzaTech closed in August 2024, net of cash used during the quarter.\n\nPost September 30, 2024, LanzaTech made a $10.0 million settlement payment to one of the two parties involved in the Forward Purchase Agreement (“FPA”) that was put in place in 2023. It was the Company’s decision to fully satisfy our obligations to this party under the FPA in cash in order to: (1) reduce the number of outstanding common shares, and (2) limit future downward pressure on the stock price in the event that this party were to sell its equity position in LanzaTech on the open market. LanzaTech had the option to settle part of the payment in shares, but as of the date of the settlement, a settlement in common shares per the terms of the FPA would have valued the shares at a discount to the market price.\n\n**Fourth-quarter and Full-year 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nGiven several large initiatives in various stages of development and finalization, outcomes for fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results create a wide range of potential outcomes. Potential revenue drivers for fourth-quarter 2024 are comprised of the following key components that have varying degrees of associated timing uncertainty:\n\n  1. The current base business has generated approximately $10.0 million per quarter for the first three quarters of 2024, and the expectation is that fourth quarter results will be similar\n  2. Project Drake is advancing, and assuming the agreements are finalized, the positive impact is forecasted to be material in terms of potential cash flow and income for the fourth quarter\n  3. LanzaTech’s project package for the site under development in Norway is expected to be submitted to Brookfield for FID evaluation in the coming weeks, and it is estimated that the project transfer, in the event of a positive FID, could represent approximately $20.0 million of revenue or income for the Company\n  4. Assuming progress advances as expected, LanzaTech is anticipating that the award contracting process for Project SECURE will be finalized by the end of 2024, which is forecasted to generate approximately $4.0 million of revenue during fourth-quarter 2024\n  5. LanzaJet’s development pipeline related to the deployment of Alcohol-to-Jet sublicenses continues to mature, and the successful signing of another agreement could result in additional share consideration and incremental revenue estimated to be approximately $8.0 million during fourth-quarter 2024 \n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nLanzaTech will host a conference call today, November 8, 2024, at 8:30 A.M. EST to review the Company's financial results, discuss recent events, and conduct a question-and-answer session.\n\nThe conference call may be accessed via a live webcast on a listen-only basis through the  _Events and Presentations_ section of LanzaTech’s Investor Relations website pages. An archive of the webcast will be available for twelve months.\n\nTo attend the live conference call via telephone, domestic callers can access by dialing 1-800-274-8461 and international callers can access by dialing 1-203-518-9814, and entering the conference identification code: LANZA\n\nA replay of the conference call will be available shortly after the call ends and can be accessed by domestic callers by dialing 1-844-512-2921 and by international callers by dialing 1-412-317-6671, and entering the access identification code: 11157335.

LanzaTech undertakes no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with US GAAP and to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have presented adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by US GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as our net loss, excluding the impact of depreciation, interest income, net, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, change in fair value of SAFE liabilities, change in fair value of the FPA Put Option liability and Fixed Maturity Consideration, change in fair value of our outstanding convertible note, transaction costs on issuance of Forward Purchase Agreement, (loss) gain from equity method investees and other one-time costs related to the Business Combination and securities registration on Form S-4 and our registration statement on Form S-1. We monitor adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, to establish budgets, and to develop operational goals for managing our business. We believe adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of certain expenses that we include in net loss. Accordingly, we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors, analysts, and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with US GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of adjusted EBITDA rather than net loss, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP. For example, adjusted EBITDA: (i) excludes stock-based compensation expense because it is a significant non-cash expense that is not directly related to our operating performance; (ii) excludes depreciation expense and, although this is a non-cash expense, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future; (iii) excludes gain or losses on equity method investee; and (iv) excludes certain income or expense items that do not provide a comparable measure of our business performance. In addition, the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculations of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results. In addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.\n\n**LANZATECH
