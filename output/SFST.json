(NASDAQ: SFST), holding company for\nSouthern First Bank, today announced its financial results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024.\n“Our third quarter results continued our positive momentum and outlook this year. Our focus on building a high-quality balance\nsheet again rewarded us with outstanding asset quality performance, which is among the industry’s best. We are well-\npositioned for increasing profitability in this operating environment despite persistent growth headwinds and uncertain\ninterest rate moves by the Fed,” stated Art Seaver, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “This quarter we executed on\nopportunities to lower our funding costs, which is reflected in our solid margin expansion. Our team did an outstanding job of\ngrowing core checking accounts by 21%, annualized. Loan growth was flat due to our deliberate actions around disciplined\npricing and high credit quality standards. We also believe that business growth may be waiting for additional clarity on interest\nrates, the political environment and global influences on the economy. Meanwhile, we are taking care of our clients and\ndeveloping strong business pipelines one relationship at a time with relentless relationship banking and exceptional service.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Highlights\n• Net income of $4.4 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.54\n• Total loans of $3.6 billion and total deposits of $3.5 billion\n• Nonperforming assets to total assets of 0.28% and net recoveries of $9 thousand\n• Net interest margin of 2.08% for Q3 2024, compared to 1.98% for Q2 2024\n• Book value per common share of $40.04 and TCE ratio of 7.82%\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30 June 30 March 31 December 31 September 30\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nEarnings ($ in thousands, except per share data):\nNet income available to common shareholders $ 4,382 2,999 2,522 4,167 4,098\nEarnings per common share, diluted 0.54 0.37 0.31 0.51 0.51\nTotal revenue(1) 23,766 23,051 21,309 21,390 22,094\nNet interest margin (tax-equivalent)(2) 2.08% 1.98% 1.94% 1.92% 1.97%\nReturn on average assets(3) 0.43% 0.29% 0.25% 0.40% 0.40%\nReturn on average equity(3) 5.40% 3.81% 3.22% 5.39% 5.35%\nEfficiency ratio(4) 75.90% 80.87% 84.94% 79.61% 78.31%\nNoninterest expense to average assets (3) 1.75% 1.81% 1.81% 1.64% 1.69%\nBalance Sheet ($ in thousands):\nTotal loans(5) $ 3,619,556 3,622,521 3,643,766 3,602,627 3,553,632\nTotal deposits 3,518,825 3,459,869 3,460,681 3,379,564 3,347,771\nCore deposits(6) 2,705,429 2,788,223 2,807,473 2,811,499 2,866,574\nTotal assets 4,174,631 4,109,849 4,105,704 4,055,789 4,019,957\nBook value per common share 40.04 39.09 38.65 38.63 37.57\nLoans to deposits 102.86% 104.70% 105.29% 106.60% 106.15%\nHolding Company Capital Ratios(7):\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 12.61% 12.77% 12.59% 12.57% 12.56%\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 10.99% 10.80% 10.63% 10.60% 10.58%\nLeverage ratio 8.50% 8.27% 8.44% 8.14% 8.17%\nCommon equity tier 1 ratio(8) 10.58% 10.39% 10.22% 10.19% 10.17%\nTangible common equity(9) 7.82% 7.76% 7.68% 7.70% 7.56%\nAsset Quality Ratios:\nNonperforming assets/total assets 0.28% 0.27% 0.09% 0.10% 0.11%\nClassified assets/tier one capital plus allowance for credit losses 4.35% 4.22% 3.99% 4.25% 4.72%\nLoans 30 days or more past due/loans(5) 0.16% 0.30% 0.36% 0.37% 0.13%\nNet charge-offs/average loans(5) (YTD annualized) 0.05% 0.07% 0.03% 0.00% 0.01%\nAllowance for credit losses/loans(5) 1.11% 1.11% 1.11% 1.13% 1.16%\nAllowance for credit losses/nonaccrual loans 346.78% 357.95% 1,109.13% 1,026.58% 953.25%\n[Footnotes to table located on page 6]\n1\nINCOME STATEMENTS – Unaudited\nQuarter Ended\nSept 30 Jun 30 Mar 31 Dec 31 Sept 30\n(in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nInterest income\nLoans $ 47,550 46,545 45,605 44,758 43,542\nInvestment securities 1,412 1,418 1,478 1,674 1,470\nFederal funds sold 2,209 2,583 1,280 2,703 2,435\nTotal interest income 51,171 50,546 48,363 49,135 47,447\nInterest expense\nDeposits 27,725 28,216 26,932 27,127 25,130\nBorrowings 2,855 2,802 2,786 2,948 2,972\nTotal interest expense 30,580 31,018 29,718 30,075 28,102\nNet interest income 20,591 19,528 18,645 19,060 19,345\nProvision (reversal) for credit losses - 500 (175) (975) (500)\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses 20,591 19,028 18,820 20,035 19,845\nNoninterest income\nMortgage banking income 1,449 1,923 1,164 868 1,208\nService fees on deposit accounts 455 423 387 371 356\nATM and debit card income 599 587 544 565 588\nIncome from bank owned life insurance 401 384 377 361 349\nOther income 271 206 192 165 248\nTotal noninterest income 3,175 3,523 2,664 2,330 2,749\nNoninterest expense\nCompensation and benefits 10,789 11,290 10,857 9,401 10,231\nOccupancy 2,595 2,552 2,557 2,718 2,562\nOutside service and data processing costs 1,930 1,962 1,846 2,000 1,744\nInsurance 1,025 965 955 937 1,243\nProfessional fees 548 582 618 581 504\nMarketing 319 389 369 364 293\nOther 833 903 898 1,027 725\nTotal noninterest expenses 18,039 18,643 18,100 17,028 17,302\nIncome before provision for income taxes 5,727 3,908 3,384 5,337 5,293\nIncome tax expense 1,345 909 862 1,170 1,195\nNet income available to common shareholders $ 4,382 2,999 2,522 4,167 4,098\nEarnings per common share – Basic $ 0.54 0.37 0.31 0.51 0.51\nEarnings per common share – Diluted 0.54 0.37 0.31 0.51 0.51\nBasic weighted average common shares 8,064 8,126 8,110 8,056 8,053\nDiluted weighted average common shares 8,089 8,141 8,142 8,080 8,072\n[Footnotes to table located on page 6]\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.4 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, a $1.4 million increase from the second\nquarter of 2024 and a $284 thousand increase from the third quarter of 2023.

There was no provision during the third quarter due to loans remaining flat and low charge-\noffs during the quarter.\nNoninterest income was $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.5 million for the second quarter of 2024.\nMortgage banking income continues to be the largest component of our noninterest income at $1.4 million for the third quarter\nof 2024 compared to $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2024.\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $18.0 million, a $604 thousand decrease from the second quarter of\n2024. The decrease in noninterest expense from the previous quarter was driven by a decrease in compensation and benefits\nexpense. The decrease in compensation and benefits expenses was due primarily to a decrease in commissions expense and\ncertain employee benefits expenses.\n2\nOur effective tax rate was 23.5% for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 23.3% for the second quarter of 2024.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN - Unaudited\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAverage Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/\n(dollars in thousands) Balance Expense Rate(3) Balance Expense Rate(3) Balance Expense Rate(3)\nInterest-earning assets\nFederal funds sold and interest-\nbearing deposits $ 158,222 $ 2,209 5.55% $ 186,584 $ 2,583 5.57% $ 181,784 $ 2,435 5.31%\nInvestment securities, taxable 137,087 1,370 3.98% 133,507 1,376 4.15% 148,239 1,429 3.82%\nInvestment securities, nontaxable(2) 8,047 55 2.70% 8,027 55 2.73% 7,799 55 2.77%\nLoans(10) 3,629,050 47,550 5.21% 3,645,595 46,545 5.14% 3,554,478 43,542 4.86%\nTotal interest-earning assets 3,932,406 51,184 5.18% 3,973,713 50,559 5.12% 3,892,300 47,461 4.84%\nNoninterest-earning assets 158,550 165,093 159,103\nTotal assets $4,090,956 $4,138,806 $4,051,403\nInterest-bearing liabilities\nNOW accounts $ 314,669 835 1.06% $ 302,881 621 0.82% $ 297,028 620 0.83%\nSavings & money market 1,523,834 15,287 3.99% 1,611,991 16,324 4.07% 1,748,638 16,908 3.84%\nTime deposits 909,192 11,603 5.08% 898,878 11,271 5.04% 648,949 7,602 4.65%\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 2,747,695 27,725 4.01% 2,813,750 28,216 4.03% 2,694,615 25,130 3.70%\nFHLB advances and other borrowings 240,065 2,297 3.81% 240,000 2,247 3.77% 264,141 2,414 3.63%\nSubordinated debentures 36,261 558 6.12% 36,360 555 6.14% 36,278 558 6.10%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,024,021 30,580 4.02% 3,090,110 31,018 4.04% 2,995,034 28,102 3.72%\nNoninterest-bearing liabilities 744,025 731,843 752,433\nShareholders’ equity 322,910 316,853 303,936\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’\nequity $4,090,956 $4,138,806 $4,051,403\nNet interest spread 1.16% 1.08% 1.12%\nNet interest income (tax equivalent) /\nmargin $20,604 2.08% $19,541 1.98% $19,359 1.97%\nLess: tax-equivalent adjustment(2) 13 13 14\nNet interest income $20,591 $19,528 $19,345\n[Footnotes to table located on page 6]\nNet interest income was $20.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a $1.1 million increase from the second quarter of 2024,\ndriven by a $625 thousand increase in interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, and a $438 thousand decrease in interest\nexpense.

Our focus on building a strong,\nhigh-quality balance sheet with measured, deliberate growth has been paying off in our financial results,” stated Art Seaver,\nthe Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are balancing our objective of delivering high performance today with our patience\nin building an even stronger company for the future. Part of this effort is attracting high-quality talent to our Southern First\nteam and we did just that this quarter with the addition of Chris Zych as Chief Financial Officer.

Net interest income increased $883 thousand\nduring the second quarter of 2024, compared to the first quarter of 2024, and increased $703 thousand, compared to the\nsecond quarter of 2023. The increase in net interest income from the prior quarter and prior year was driven by additional\ninterest income on our interest-earning assets.\nThe provision for credit losses was $500 thousand for the second quarter of 2024, compared to a reversal of $175 thousand\nduring the first quarter of 2024. The second quarter provision for credit losses includes a $750 thousand provision related to\nthe loan portfolio which was driven by an increase in the level of charge-offs we experienced during the quarter, combined with\nan increase in the specific reserve on individually assessed loans. In addition, the provision for credit losses includes a $250\nthousand reversal in the provision for unfunded commitments due to a decrease in the balance of unfunded commitments at\nJune 30, 2024.\nNoninterest income was $3.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2024.\nMortgage banking income continues to be the largest component of our noninterest income at $1.9 million for the second\nquarter of 2024 compared to $1.2 million for the first quarter of 2024.\n2\nNoninterest expense for the second quarter of 2024 was $18.6 million, a $543 thousand increase from the first quarter of 2024.\nThe increase in noninterest expense from the previous quarter was driven by an increase in compensation and benefits\nexpense as well as an increase in outside service and data processing costs. The increase in compensation and benefits\nexpenses was due primarily to an increase in salaries and commissions expense, while the increase in outside service and data\nprocessing costs was driven by an increase in software licensing and maintenance costs.\nOur effective tax rate was 23.3% for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to 25.5% for the first quarter of 2024. The lower\ntax rate in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily related to the effect of equity compensation transactions during the\nquarter.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN - Unaudited\nFor the Three Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 June 30, 2023\nAverage Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/\n(dollars in thousands) Balance Expense Rate(3) Balance Expense Rate(3) Balance Expense Rate(3)\nInterest-earning assets\nFederal funds sold and interest-\nbearing deposits $ 186,584 $ 2,583 5.57% $ 89,969 $ 1,280 5.71% $ 71,004 $ 891 5.03%\nInvestment securities, taxable 133,507 1,376 4.15% 137,271 1,436 4.20% 93,922 623 2.66%\nInvestment securities, nontaxable(2) 8,027 55 2.73% 8,097 55 2.70% 10,200 108 4.24%\nLoans(10) 3,645,595 46,545 5.14% 3,622,972 45,605 5.05% 3,511,225 41,089 4.69%\nTotal interest-earning assets 3,973,713 50,559 5.12% 3,858,309 48,376 5.03% 3,686,351 42,711 4.65%\nNoninterest-earning assets 165,093 159,813 155,847\nTotal assets $4,138,806 $4,018,122 $3,842,198\nInterest-bearing liabilities\nNOW accounts $ 302,881 621 0.82% $ 295,774 660 0.90% $ 297,234 537 0.72%\nSavings & money market 1,611,991 16,324 4.07% 1,620,521 16,299 4.03% 1,727,009 15,298 3.55%\nTime deposits 898,878 11,271 5.04% 801,734 9,973 4.99% 573,095 6,102 4.27%\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 2,813,750 28,216 4.03% 2,718,029 26,932 3.97% 2,597,338 21,937 3.39%\nFHLB advances and other borrowings 240,000 2,247 3.77% 241,319 2,229 3.71% 135,922 1,382 4.08%\nSubordinated debentures 36,360 555 6.14% 36,333 557 6.15% 36,251 542 6.00%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,090,110 31,018 4.04% 2,995,681 29,718 3.98% 2,769,511 23,861 3.46%\nNoninterest-bearing liabilities 731,843 707,890 771,388\nShareholders’ equity 316,853 314,551 301,299\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’\nequity $4,138,806 $4,018,122 $3,842,198\nNet interest spread 1.08% 1.05% 1.19%\nNet interest income (tax equivalent) /\nmargin $19,541 1.98% $18,658 1.94% $18,850 2.05%\nLess: tax-equivalent adjustment(2) 13 13 25\nNet interest income $19,528 $18,645 $18,825\n[Footnotes to table located on page 6]\nNet interest income was $19.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, an $883 thousand increase from the first quarter of 2024,\ndriven by a $2.2 million increase in interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in\ninterest expense. The increase in interest income was driven by a $96.6 million increase in average federal funds sold and\ninterest-bearing deposit balances, combined with a higher yield on our loan portfolio. Our net interest margin, on a tax-\nequivalent basis, was 1.98% for the second quarter of 2024, a four-basis point increase from 1.94% for the first quarter of 2024.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the yield on our loan portfolio increased by nine-basis points, while the cost of our interest-\nbearing deposits increased by only six-basis points, as compared to the first quarter of 2024, resulting in an increase in net\ninterest margin for the period. In addition, our non-interest bearing deposits increased 6.94%, on an annualized basis, during\nthe second quarter of 2024.\n3\nBALANCE SHEETS - Unaudited\nEnding Balance\nJune 30 March 31 December 31 September 30 June 30\n(in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2024 2023 2023 2023\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents:\nCash and due from banks $ 21,567 13,925 28,020 17,395 24,742\nFederal funds sold 164,432 144,595 119,349 127,714 170,145\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks 8,828 8,789 8,801 7,283 10,183\nTotal cash and cash equivalents 194,827 167,309 156,170 152,392 205,070\nInvestment securities:\nInvestment securities available for sale 121,353 125,996 134,702 144,035 91,548\nOther investments 18,653 18,499 19,939 19,600 12,550\nTotal investment securities 140,006 144,495 154,641 163,635 104,098\nMortgage loans held for sale 14,759 11,842 7,194 7,117 15,781\nLoans (5) 3,622,521 3,643,766 3,602,627 3,553,632 3,537,616\nLess allowance for credit losses (40,157) (40,441) (40,682) (41,131) (41,105)\nLoans, net 3,582,364 3,603,325 3,561,945 3,512,501 3,496,511\nBank owned life insurance 53,263 52,878 52,501 52,140 51,791\nProperty and equipment, net 91,533 93,007 94,301 95,743 96,964\nDeferred income taxes 12,339 12,321 12,200 13,078 12,356\nOther assets 20,758 20,527 16,837 23,351 19,536\nTotal assets $ 4,109,849 4,105,704 4,055,789 4,019,957 4,002,107\nLiabilities\nDeposits $ 3,459,869 3,460,681 3,379,564 3,347,771 3,433,018\nFHLB Advances 240,000 240,000 275,000 275,000 180,000\nSubordinated debentures 36,376 36,349 36,322 36,295 36,268\nOther liabilities 54,856 53,418 52,436 56,993 51,307\nTotal liabilities 3,791,101 3,790,448 3,743,322 3,716,059 3,700,593\nShareholders’ equity\nPreferred stock - $.01 par value; 10,000,000 shares\nauthorized - - - - -\nCommon Stock - $.01 par value; 20,000,000 shares\nauthorized 82 82 81 81 81\nNonvested restricted stock (4,710) (5,257) (3,596) (4,065) (4,051)\nAdditional paid-in capital 124,174 124,159 121,777 121,757 120,912\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (11,866) (11,797) (11,342) (15,255) (12,710)\nRetained earnings 211,068 208,069 205,547 201,380 197,282\nTotal shareholders’ equity 318,748 315,256 312,467 303,898 301,514\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 4,109,849 4,105,704 4,055,789 4,019,957 4,002,107\nCommon Stock\nBook value per common share $ 39.09 38.65 38.63 37.57 37.42\nStock price:\nHigh 30.36 38.71 37.15 30.18 31.34\nLow 25.70 29.80 25.16 24.22 21.33\nPeriod end 29.24 31.76 37.10 26.94 24.75\nCommon shares outstanding 8,155 8,156 8,088 8,089 8,058\n[Footnotes to table located on page 6]\n4\nASSET QUALITY MEASURES - Unaudited\nQuarter Ended\nJune 30 March 31 December 31 September 30 June 30\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2024 2023 2023 2023\nNonperforming Assets\nCommercial\nNon-owner occupied RE $ 7,949 1,410 1,423 1,615 754\nCommercial business 829 488 319 404 137\nConsumer\nReal estate 1,875 1,380 985 1,228 1,053\nHome equity 565 367 1,236 1,068 1,072\nOther - 1 - - -\nTotal nonaccrual loans 11,218 3,646 3,963 4,315 3,016\nOther real estate owned - - - - -\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 11,218 3,646 3,963 4,315 3,016\nNonperforming assets as a percentage of:\nTotal assets 0.27% 0.09% 0.10% 0.11% 0.08%\nTotal loans 0.31% 0.10% 0.11% 0.12% 0.09%\nClassified assets/tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit\nlosses 4.22% 3.99% 4.25% 4.72% 4.68%\nQuarter Ended\nJune 30 March 31 December 31 September 30 June 30\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2024 2023 2023 2023\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nBalance, beginning of period $ 40,441 40,682 41,131 41,105 40,435\nLoans charged-off (1,049) (424) (119) (42) (440)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged-off 15 183 310 168 15\nNet loans (charged-off) recovered (1,034) (241) 191 126 (425)\nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses 750 - (640) (100) 1,095\nBalance, end of period $ 40,157 40,441 40,682 41,131 41,105\nAllowance for credit losses to gross loans 1.11 % 1.11 % 1.13 % 1.16 % 1.16 %\nAllowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 357.95 % 1,109.13 % 1,026.58 % 953.25 % 1,363.11 %\nNet charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans QTD\n(annualized) 0.11 % 0.03 % (0.02 %) (0.01 %) 0.05 %\nTotal nonperforming assets increased by $7.6 million during the second quarter of 2024, and represented 0.27% of total assets,\nan increase compared to 0.09% for the first quarter of 2024.

the first quarter of 2024 was $2.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, a $1.6 million decrease from the fourth\nquarter of 2023 and a $181 thousand decrease from the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income decreased $415 thousand\nduring the first quarter of 2024, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and decreased $1.8 million, compared to the first\nquarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest income from the prior quarter was driven by less interest income on our federal\nfunds sold and interest-bearing deposits, while the decrease from the prior year was driven by an increase in deposit and\nfunding costs.\nThere was a reversal of the provision for credit losses of $175 thousand for the first quarter of 2024, compared to a reversal of\n$975 thousand during the fourth quarter of 2023 and a provision of $1.8 million during the first quarter of 2023. The provision\nreversal of $175 thousand during the first quarter of 2024 relates to a reversal in the reserve for unfunded commitments,\ndriven by a decrease in the balance of unfunded commitments at March 31, 2024. As we continue to experience low net charge-\noffs, our expected loss rates continue to decline, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of\ntotal loans.\nNoninterest income was $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $2.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and\n$2.0 million for the first quarter of 2023. Mortgage banking income continues to be the largest component of our noninterest\n2\nincome at $1.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, $868 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $622 thousand for the\nfirst quarter of 2023.\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2024 was $18.1 million, a $1.1 million increase from the fourth quarter of 2023,\nand a $996 thousand increase from the first quarter of 2023. The increase in noninterest expense from the previous quarter\nwas driven by an increase in compensation and benefits expense, while the increase from the prior year related not only to an\nincrease in compensation and benefits expenses, but also to increases in outside service and data processing costs and\ninsurance expenses. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses during the current quarter was due primarily to an\nincrease in various benefit-related expenses. In addition, the increase in outside service and data processing costs from the\nprior quarter and prior year was driven by an increase in software licensing and maintenance costs, while insurance costs\nincreased over the prior year due to higher FDIC insurance premiums.\nOur effective tax rate was 25.5% for the first quarter of 2024, 21.9% for the fourth quarter of 2023, and 23.6% for the first\nquarter of 2023. The higher tax rate in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter and prior year was primarily\nrelated to the effect of equity compensation transactions during the quarter.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN - Unaudited\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2023\nAverage Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/\n(dollars in thousands) Balance Expense Rate(3) Balance Expense Rate(3) Balance Expense Rate(3)\nInterest-earning assets\nFederal funds sold and interest-\nbearing deposits $ 89,969 $ 1,280 5.71% $ 197,482 $ 2,703 5.43% $ 85,966 $ 969 4.57%\nInvestment securities, taxable 137,271 1,436 4.20% 151,969 1,632 4.26% 87,521 530 2.46%\nInvestment securities, nontaxable(2) 8,097 55 2.70% 7,831 55 2.76% 10,266 106 4.21%\nLoans(10) 3,622,972 45,605 5.05% 3,586,863 44,758 4.95% 3,334,530 36,748 4.47%\nTotal interest-earning assets 3,858,309 48,376 5.03% 3,944,145 49,148 4.94% 3,518,283 38,353 4.42%\nNoninterest-earning assets 159,813 174,717 161,310\nTotal assets $4,018,122 $4,118,862 $3,679,593\nInterest-bearing liabilities\nNOW accounts $ 295,774 660 0.90% $ 301,424 656 0.86% $ 303,176 440 0.59%\nSavings & money market 1,620,521 16,299 4.03% 1,697,144 17,042 3.98% 1,661,878 11,992 2.93%\nTime deposits 801,734 9,973 4.99% 759,839 9,429 4.92% 543,425 4,747 3.54%\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 2,718,029 26,932 3.97% 2,758,407 27,127 3.90% 2,508,479 17,179 2.78%\nFHLB advances and other borrowings 241,319 2,229 3.71% 257,880 2,387 3.67% 18,243 200 4.45%\nSubordinated debentures 36,333 557 6.15% 36,305 561 6.13% 36,224 527 5.90%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 2,995,681 29,718 3.98% 3,052,592 30,075 3.91% 2,562,946 17,906 2.83%\nNoninterest-bearing liabilities 707,890 759,413 818,123\nShareholders’ equity 314,551 306,857 298,524\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’\nequity $4,018,122 $4,118,862 $3,679,593\nNet interest spread 1.05% 1.04% 1.59%\nNet interest income (tax equivalent) /\nmargin $18,658 1.94% $19,073 1.92% $20,447 2.36%\nLess: tax-equivalent adjustment(2) 13 13 23\nNet interest income $18,645 $19,060 $20,424\n[Footnotes to table located on page 6]\nNet interest income was $18.6 million for the first quarter of 2024, a $415 thousand decrease from the fourth quarter of 2023,\ndriven by a $772 thousand decrease in interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, partially offset by a $357 thousand decrease\nin interest expense. The decrease in interest income was driven by a $107.5 million decrease in average federal funds sold and\ninterest-bearing deposit balances. In comparison to the first quarter of 2023, net interest income decreased $1.8 million,\nresulting primarily from a $432.7 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities during the 12 months ended March 31,\n2024, combined with a 115-basis point increase in the average cost. Our net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was\n1.94% for the first quarter of 2024, a two-basis point increase from 1.92% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and a 42-basis point\ndecrease from 2.36% for the first quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the yield on our loan portfolio increased by\n10-basis points, while the cost of our interest-bearing deposits increased by only seven basis points, as compared to the fourth\n3\nquarter of 2023, resulting in a slight increase in net interest margin for the period. The lower net interest margin during the\nfirst quarter of 2024, as compared to the first quarter of 2023, was a result of our deposit and borrowing costs increasing faster\nthan our loan yield as our interest-bearing liabilities have been more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate over the\npast two years.\nBALANCE SHEETS - Unaudited\nEnding Balance\nMarch 31 December 31 September 30 June 30 March 31\n(in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents:\nCash and due from banks $ 13,925 28,020 17,395 24,742 22,213\nFederal funds sold 144,595 119,349 127,714 170,145 242,642\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks 8,789 8,801 7,283 10,183 7,350\nTotal cash and cash equivalents 167,309 156,170 152,392 205,070 272,205\nInvestment securities:\nInvestment securities available for sale 125,996 134,702 144,035 91,548 94,036\nOther investments 18,499 19,939 19,600 12,550 10,097\nTotal investment securities 144,495 154,641 163,635 104,098 104,133\nMortgage loans held for sale 11,842 7,194 7,117 15,781 6,979\nLoans (5) 3,643,766 3,602,627 3,553,632 3,537,616 3,417,945\nLess allowance for credit losses (40,441) (40,682) (41,131) (41,105) (40,435)\nLoans, net 3,603,325 3,561,945 3,512,501 3,496,511 3,377,510\nBank owned life insurance 52,878 52,501 52,140 51,791 51,453\nProperty and equipment, net 93,007 94,301 95,743 96,964 97,806\nDeferred income taxes 12,321 12,200 13,078 12,356 12,087\nOther assets 20,527 16,837 23,351 19,536 15,967\nTotal assets $ 4,105,704 4,055,789 4,019,957 4,002,107 3,938,140\nLiabilities\nDeposits $ 3,460,681 3,379,564 3,347,771 3,433,018 3,426,774\nFHLB Advances 240,000 275,000 275,000 180,000 125,000\nSubordinated debentures 36,349 36,322 36,295 36,268 36,241\nOther liabilities 53,418 52,436 56,993 51,307 50,775\nTotal liabilities 3,790,448 3,743,322 3,716,059 3,700,593 3,638,790\nShareholders’ equity\nPreferred stock - $.01 par value; 10,000,000 shares\nauthorized - - - - -\nCommon Stock - $.01 par value; 10,000,000 shares\nauthorized 82 81 81 81 80\nNonvested restricted stock (5,257) (3,596) (4,065) (4,051) (4,462)\nAdditional paid-in capital 124,159 121,777 121,757 120,912 120,683\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (11,797) (11,342) (15,255) (12,710) (11,775)\nRetained earnings 208,069 205,547 201,380 197,282 194,824\nTotal shareholders’ equity 315,256 312,467 303,898 301,514 299,350\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 4,105,704 4,055,789 4,019,957 4,002,107 3,938,140\nCommon Stock\nBook value per common share $ 38.65 38.63 37.57 37.42 37.16\nStock price:\nHigh 38.71 37.15 30.18 31.34 45.05\nLow 29.80 25.16 24.22 21.33 30.70\nPeriod end 31.76 37.10 26.94 24.75 30.70\nCommon shares outstanding 8,156 8,088 8,089 8,058 8,048\n[Footnotes to table located on page 6]\n4\nASSET QUALITY MEASURES - Unaudited\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31 December 31 September 30 June 30 March 31\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023\nNonperforming Assets\nCommercial\nNon-owner occupied RE $ 1,410 1,423 1,615 754 1,384\nCommercial business 488 319 404 137 1,196\nConsumer\nReal estate 1,380 985 1,228 1,053 1,075\nHome equity 367 1,236 1,068 1,072 1,078\nOther 1 - - - -\nTotal nonaccrual loans 3,646 3,963 4,315 3,016 4,733\nOther real estate owned - - - - -\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 3,646 3,963 4,315 3,016 4,733\nNonperforming assets as a percentage of:\nTotal assets 0.09% 0.10% 0.11% 0.08% 0.12%\nTotal loans 0.10% 0.11% 0.12% 0.09% 0.14%\nClassified assets/tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit\nlosses 3.99% 4.25% 4.72% 4.68% 5.10%\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31 December 31 September 30 June 30 March 31\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nBalance, beginning of period $ 40,682 41,131 41,105 40,435 38,639\nLoans charged-off (424) (119) (42) (440) (161)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged-off 183 310 168 15 102\nNet loans (charged-off) recovered (241) 191 126 (425) (59)\nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses - (640) (100) 1,095 1,855\nBalance, end of period $ 40,441 40,682 41,131 41,105 40,435\nAllowance for credit losses to gross loans 1.11 % 1.13 % 1.16 % 1.16 % 1.18 %\nAllowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 1,109.13 % 1,026.58 % 953.25 % 1,363.11 % 854.33 %\nNet charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans QTD\n(annualized) 0.03 % (0.02 %) (0.01 %) 0.05 % 0.01 %\nTotal nonperforming assets decreased by $317 thousand during the first quarter of 2024, and represented 0.09% of total\nassets, a decrease compared to 0.10% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 0.12% for the first quarter of 2023.

(NASDAQ: SFST), holding company for\nSouthern First Bank, today announced its financial results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024.\n“Our third quarter results continued our positive momentum and outlook this year. Our focus on building a high-quality balance\nsheet again rewarded us with outstanding asset quality performance, which is among the industry’s best. We are well-\npositioned for increasing profitability in this operating environment despite persistent growth headwinds and uncertain\ninterest rate moves by the Fed,” stated Art Seaver, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “This quarter we executed on\nopportunities to lower our funding costs, which is reflected in our solid margin expansion. Our team did an outstanding job of\ngrowing core checking accounts by 21%, annualized. Loan growth was flat due to our deliberate actions around disciplined\npricing and high credit quality standards. We also believe that business growth may be waiting for additional clarity on interest\nrates, the political environment and global influences on the economy. Meanwhile, we are taking care of our clients and\ndeveloping strong business pipelines one relationship at a time with relentless relationship banking and exceptional service.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Highlights\n• Net income of $4.4 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.54\n• Total loans of $3.6 billion and total deposits of $3.5 billion\n• Nonperforming assets to total assets of 0.28% and net recoveries of $9 thousand\n• Net interest margin of 2.08% for Q3 2024, compared to 1.98% for Q2 2024\n• Book value per common share of $40.04 and TCE ratio of 7.82%\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30 June 30 March 31 December 31 September 30\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nEarnings ($ in thousands, except per share data):\nNet income available to common shareholders $ 4,382 2,999 2,522 4,167 4,098\nEarnings per common share, diluted 0.54 0.37 0.31 0.51 0.51\nTotal revenue(1) 23,766 23,051 21,309 21,390 22,094\nNet interest margin (tax-equivalent)(2) 2.08% 1.98% 1.94% 1.92% 1.97%\nReturn on average assets(3) 0.43% 0.29% 0.25% 0.40% 0.40%\nReturn on average equity(3) 5.40% 3.81% 3.22% 5.39% 5.35%\nEfficiency ratio(4) 75.90% 80.87% 84.94% 79.61% 78.31%\nNoninterest expense to average assets (3) 1.75% 1.81% 1.81% 1.64% 1.69%\nBalance Sheet ($ in thousands):\nTotal loans(5) $ 3,619,556 3,622,521 3,643,766 3,602,627 3,553,632\nTotal deposits 3,518,825 3,459,869 3,460,681 3,379,564 3,347,771\nCore deposits(6) 2,705,429 2,788,223 2,807,473 2,811,499 2,866,574\nTotal assets 4,174,631 4,109,849 4,105,704 4,055,789 4,019,957\nBook value per common share 40.04 39.09 38.65 38.63 37.57\nLoans to deposits 102.86% 104.70% 105.29% 106.60% 106.15%\nHolding Company Capital Ratios(7):\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 12.61% 12.77% 12.59% 12.57% 12.56%\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 10.99% 10.80% 10.63% 10.60% 10.58%\nLeverage ratio 8.50% 8.27% 8.44% 8.14% 8.17%\nCommon equity tier 1 ratio(8) 10.58% 10.39% 10.22% 10.19% 10.17%\nTangible common equity(9) 7.82% 7.76% 7.68% 7.70% 7.56%\nAsset Quality Ratios:\nNonperforming assets/total assets 0.28% 0.27% 0.09% 0.10% 0.11%\nClassified assets/tier one capital plus allowance for credit losses 4.35% 4.22% 3.99% 4.25% 4.72%\nLoans 30 days or more past due/loans(5) 0.16% 0.30% 0.36% 0.37% 0.13%\nNet charge-offs/average loans(5) (YTD annualized) 0.05% 0.07% 0.03% 0.00% 0.01%\nAllowance for credit losses/loans(5) 1.11% 1.11% 1.11% 1.13% 1.16%\nAllowance for credit losses/nonaccrual loans 346.78% 357.95% 1,109.13% 1,026.58% 953.25%\n[Footnotes to table located on page 6]\n1\nINCOME STATEMENTS – Unaudited\nQuarter Ended\nSept 30 Jun 30 Mar 31 Dec 31 Sept 30\n(in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nInterest income\nLoans $ 47,550 46,545 45,605 44,758 43,542\nInvestment securities 1,412 1,418 1,478 1,674 1,470\nFederal funds sold 2,209 2,583 1,280 2,703 2,435\nTotal interest income 51,171 50,546 48,363 49,135 47,447\nInterest expense\nDeposits 27,725 28,216 26,932 27,127 25,130\nBorrowings 2,855 2,802 2,786 2,948 2,972\nTotal interest expense 30,580 31,018 29,718 30,075 28,102\nNet interest income 20,591 19,528 18,645 19,060 19,345\nProvision (reversal) for credit losses - 500 (175) (975) (500)\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses 20,591 19,028 18,820 20,035 19,845\nNoninterest income\nMortgage banking income 1,449 1,923 1,164 868 1,208\nService fees on deposit accounts 455 423 387 371 356\nATM and debit card income 599 587 544 565 588\nIncome from bank owned life insurance 401 384 377 361 349\nOther income 271 206 192 165 248\nTotal noninterest income 3,175 3,523 2,664 2,330 2,749\nNoninterest expense\nCompensation and benefits 10,789 11,290 10,857 9,401 10,231\nOccupancy 2,595 2,552 2,557 2,718 2,562\nOutside service and data processing costs 1,930 1,962 1,846 2,000 1,744\nInsurance 1,025 965 955 937 1,243\nProfessional fees 548 582 618 581 504\nMarketing 319 389 369 364 293\nOther 833 903 898 1,027 725\nTotal noninterest expenses 18,039 18,643 18,100 17,028 17,302\nIncome before provision for income taxes 5,727 3,908 3,384 5,337 5,293\nIncome tax expense 1,345 909 862 1,170 1,195\nNet income available to common shareholders $ 4,382 2,999 2,522 4,167 4,098\nEarnings per common share – Basic $ 0.54 0.37 0.31 0.51 0.51\nEarnings per common share – Diluted 0.54 0.37 0.31 0.51 0.51\nBasic weighted average common shares 8,064 8,126 8,110 8,056 8,053\nDiluted weighted average common shares 8,089 8,141 8,142 8,080 8,072\n[Footnotes to table located on page 6]\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.4 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, a $1.4 million increase from the second\nquarter of 2024 and a $284 thousand increase from the third quarter of 2023.

The increase in net interest income from the prior quarter and prior year was driven by additional interest income on\nour interest-earning assets.\nThere was no provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of $500 thousand\nduring the second quarter of 2024. There was no provision during the third quarter due to loans remaining flat and low charge-\noffs during the quarter.\nNoninterest income was $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.5 million for the second quarter of 2024.\nMortgage banking income continues to be the largest component of our noninterest income at $1.4 million for the third quarter\nof 2024 compared to $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2024.\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $18.0 million, a $604 thousand decrease from the second quarter of\n2024. The decrease in noninterest expense from the previous quarter was driven by a decrease in compensation and benefits\nexpense. The decrease in compensation and benefits expenses was due primarily to a decrease in commissions expense and\ncertain employee benefits expenses.\n2\nOur effective tax rate was 23.5% for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 23.3% for the second quarter of 2024.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN - Unaudited\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAverage Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/\n(dollars in thousands) Balance Expense Rate(3) Balance Expense Rate(3) Balance Expense Rate(3)\nInterest-earning assets\nFederal funds sold and interest-\nbearing deposits $ 158,222 $ 2,209 5.55% $ 186,584 $ 2,583 5.57% $ 181,784 $ 2,435 5.31%\nInvestment securities, taxable 137,087 1,370 3.98% 133,507 1,376 4.15% 148,239 1,429 3.82%\nInvestment securities, nontaxable(2) 8,047 55 2.70% 8,027 55 2.73% 7,799 55 2.77%\nLoans(10) 3,629,050 47,550 5.21% 3,645,595 46,545 5.14% 3,554,478 43,542 4.86%\nTotal interest-earning assets 3,932,406 51,184 5.18% 3,973,713 50,559 5.12% 3,892,300 47,461 4.84%\nNoninterest-earning assets 158,550 165,093 159,103\nTotal assets $4,090,956 $4,138,806 $4,051,403\nInterest-bearing liabilities\nNOW accounts $ 314,669 835 1.06% $ 302,881 621 0.82% $ 297,028 620 0.83%\nSavings & money market 1,523,834 15,287 3.99% 1,611,991 16,324 4.07% 1,748,638 16,908 3.84%\nTime deposits 909,192 11,603 5.08% 898,878 11,271 5.04% 648,949 7,602 4.65%\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 2,747,695 27,725 4.01% 2,813,750 28,216 4.03% 2,694,615 25,130 3.70%\nFHLB advances and other borrowings 240,065 2,297 3.81% 240,000 2,247 3.77% 264,141 2,414 3.63%\nSubordinated debentures 36,261 558 6.12% 36,360 555 6.14% 36,278 558 6.10%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,024,021 30,580 4.02% 3,090,110 31,018 4.04% 2,995,034 28,102 3.72%\nNoninterest-bearing liabilities 744,025 731,843 752,433\nShareholders’ equity 322,910 316,853 303,936\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’\nequity $4,090,956 $4,138,806 $4,051,403\nNet interest spread 1.16% 1.08% 1.12%\nNet interest income (tax equivalent) /\nmargin $20,604 2.08% $19,541 1.98% $19,359 1.97%\nLess: tax-equivalent adjustment(2) 13 13 14\nNet interest income $20,591 $19,528 $19,345\n[Footnotes to table located on page 6]\nNet interest income was $20.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a $1.1 million increase from the second quarter of 2024,\ndriven by a $625 thousand increase in interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, and a $438 thousand decrease in interest\nexpense.
