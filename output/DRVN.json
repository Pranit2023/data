The Company has\nprovided this non-GAAP financial information, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with\nGAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in this earnings\nrelease that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in\nconjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release. The non-GAAP\nfinancial measures in this earnings release may differ from similarly titled measures used by other\ncompanies.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures in Outlook\nDriven Brands includes Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization\n(“Adjusted EBITDA”) and Adjusted Earnings per Share (“Adjusted EPS”) in the Company’s Fiscal Year\n2024 Outlook. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and have not been\nreconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because it is not possible to do so without\nunreasonable efforts due to the uncertainty and potential variability of reconciling items, which are\ndependent on future events and often outside of management’s control and which could be significant.\nBecause such items cannot be reasonably predicted with the level of precision required, we are unable to\nprovide an outlook for the comparable GAAP measures. Forward-looking estimates of Adjusted EBITDA\nand Adjusted EPS are made in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted\nherein and in our filings with the SEC.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are considered non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC’s\nrules because they exclude certain amounts included in the net income attributable to Driven Brands\ncommon stockholders and diluted earnings per share attributable to Driven Brands common stockholders\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS\nare meaningful measures to share with investors because they facilitate comparison of the current period\nperformance with that of the comparable prior period. In addition, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS\nafford investors a view of what management considers to be Driven Brands’ core earnings performance as\nwell as the ability to make a more informed assessment of such earnings performance with that of the prior\nperiod.\nThe tables below reflect the calculation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share for the\nthree and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n9\nNet (Loss) Income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income $ (14,947) $ (799,311) $ 19,473 $ (731,813)\nAcquisition related costs(a) (606) 1,667 1,459 7,264\nNon-core items and project costs, net(b) 6,426 1,486 16,263 6,113\nCloud computing amortization(c) 1,022 991 3,436 991\nShare-based compensation expense(d) 12,798 2,681 35,641 9,730\nForeign currency transaction loss , net(e) 765 2,980 5,767 3\nGoodwill impairment(f) — 850,970 — 850,970\nAsset sale leaseback (gain) loss, net, impairment\nand closed store expenses(g) 36,275 125,473 55,465 119,637\nLoss on debt extinguishment (h) 205 — 205 —\nAmortization related to acquired intangible\nassets(i) 5,980 9,252 19,528 23,564\nValuation allowance for deferred tax asset(j) 7,941 — 9,196 —\nAdjusted net income before tax impact of\nadjustments 55,859 196,189 166,433 286,459\nTax impact of adjustments(k) (14,100) (166,320) (28,543) (171,783)\nAdjusted net income 41,759 29,869 137,890 114,676\n(Loss) earnings per share\nBasic $ (0.09) $ (4.82) $ 0.12 $ (4.40)\nDiluted $ (0.09) $ (4.83) $ 0.12 $ (4.41)\nAdjusted earnings per share(1)\nBasic $ 0.27 $ 0.18 $ 0.84 $ 0.69\nDiluted $ 0.26 $ 0.18 $ 0.84 $ 0.68\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic 159,804 162,398 159,743 162,698\nDiluted 159,804 162,398 160,713 162,698\nWeighted average shares outstanding for\nAdjusted Net Income\nBasic 159,804 162,398 159,743 162,698\nDiluted 161,113 165,850 160,713 166,557\n(1) Adjusted Earnings Per Share is calculated under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, adjusted earnings per share is\ncalculated using adjusted net income attributable to common shares, which is derived by reducing adjusted net income by the amount\nattributable to participating securities. Adjusted Net Income attributable to participating securities used in the basic earnings per share\ncalculation was $1 million and $3 million for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively. Adjusted Net Income\nattributable to participating securities used in the diluted earnings per share calculations was $1 million and $2 million for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023.\n10\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the Securities and Exchange\nCommission’s (“SEC”) rules because it excludes certain amounts included in net income calculated in\naccordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure to share\nwith investors because it facilitates comparison of the current period performance with that of the\ncomparable prior period. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA affords investors a view of what management\nconsiders to be Driven Brand’s core operating performance as well as the ability to make a more informed\nassessment of such operating performance as compared with that of the prior period.\nPlease see the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, filed\nwith the SEC on February 28, 2024, for additional information on Adjusted EBITDA.

This did not include the additional $135.0 million Series 2022 Class A-1 Notes that expand the Company’s variable funding note borrowing capacity if the Company elects to exercise them, assuming certain conditions continue to be met. \n\n** Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook **\n\nThe Company is re-affirming its prior outlook; the following reflects the impact of sale of our Canadian distribution business, which is expected to reduce full-year revenue by approximately $18 million and adjusted EBITDA by approximately $6 million. \n\n**Original Outlook** |  **Outlook Adjusted for Disposition** |  **Current Range Expectations**  \n---|---|---  \n**Revenue** |  ~$2.35 - $2.45 billion  |  ~$2.33 - $2.43 billion  |  Low-end   \n**Adjusted EBITDA** 1 |  ~$535 - $565 million  |  ~$529 - $559 million  |  Mid - to High-end   \n**Adjusted EPS** 1 |  ~$0.88 - $1.00  |  ~$0.88 - $1.00  |  High-end   \n  \nThe Company also expects: \n\n  * Same-store sales growth of 1% to 3% \n\n\n  * Net store growth of approximately 205 to 220 \n\n\n\nNote: The Company has not included potential future M&A in its outlook for fiscal year 2024. \n\n________________  \n---  \n1  Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information on non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures. Forward-looking estimates of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are made in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted herein.   \n2 The Company does not provide same store sales results for the Platform Services segment because it only applied to the 1-800-Radiator brand which is not a representative indicator of the segment’s performance. 1-800-Radiator’s same store sales performance is included in the Company’s overall same store sales results.   \n  \n** Conference Call **\n\nDriven Brands will host a conference call to discuss third quarter 2024 results today, Thursday, October 31, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

The Company has provided this non-GAAP financial information, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in this earnings release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release. The non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. \n\n** Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Outlook **\n\nDriven Brands includes Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) and Adjusted Earnings per Share (“Adjusted EPS”) in the Company’s Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and have not been reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because it is not possible to do so without unreasonable efforts due to the uncertainty and potential variability of reconciling items, which are dependent on future events and often outside of management’s control and which could be significant. Because such items cannot be reasonably predicted with the level of precision required, we are unable to provide an outlook for the comparable GAAP measures. Forward-looking estimates of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are made in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted herein and in our filings with the SEC. \n\n** Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share **\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are considered non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC’s rules because they exclude certain amounts included in the net income attributable to Driven Brands common stockholders and diluted earnings per share attributable to Driven Brands common stockholders calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are meaningful measures to share with investors because they facilitate comparison of the current period performance with that of the comparable prior period. In addition, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS afford investors a view of what management considers to be Driven Brands’ core earnings performance as well as the ability to make a more informed assessment of such earnings performance with that of the prior period. \n\nThe tables below reflect the calculation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**Net (Loss) Income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Unaudited)**\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n_(in thousands, except per share data)_ |  **September 28, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023** |  **September 28, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**Net (loss) income** |  $  |  (14,947  |  )  |  $  |  (799,311  |  )  |  $  |  19,473  |  $  |  (731,813  |  )   \nAcquisition related costs (a) |  (606  |  )  |  1,667  |  1,459  |  7,264   \nNon-core items and project costs, net (b) |  6,426  |  1,486  |  16,263  |  6,113   \nCloud computing amortization (c) |  1,022  |  991  |  3,436  |  991   \nShare-based compensation expense (d) |  12,798  |  2,681  |  35,641  |  9,730   \nForeign currency transaction loss , net (e) |  765  |  2,980  |  5,767  |  3   \nGoodwill impairment (f) |  —  |  850,970  |  —  |  850,970   \nAsset sale leaseback (gain) loss, net, impairment and closed store expenses (g) |  36,275  |  125,473  |  55,465  |  119,637   \nLoss on debt extinguishment (h) |  205  |  —  |  205  |  —   \nAmortization related to acquired intangible assets (i) |  5,980  |  9,252  |  19,528  |  23,564   \nValuation allowance for deferred tax asset (j) |  7,941  |  —  |  9,196  |  —   \nAdjusted net income before tax impact of adjustments  |  55,859  |  196,189  |  166,433  |  286,459   \nTax impact of adjustments (k) |  (14,100  |  )  |  (166,320  |  )  |  (28,543  |  )  |  (171,783  |  )   \n**Adjusted net income** |  41,759  |  29,869  |  137,890  |  114,676   \n(Loss) earnings per share   \nBasic  |  $  |  (0.09  |  )  |  $  |  (4.82  |  )  |  $  |  0.12  |  $  |  (4.40  |  )   \nDiluted  |  $  |  (0.09  |  )  |  $  |  (4.83  |  )  |  $  |  0.12  |  $  |  (4.41  |  )   \nAdjusted earnings per share (1)  \nBasic  |  $  |  0.27  |  $  |  0.18  |  $  |  0.84  |  $  |  0.69   \nDiluted  |  $  |  0.26  |  $  |  0.18  |  $  |  0.84  |  $  |  0.68   \nWeighted average shares outstanding   \nBasic  |  159,804  |  162,398  |  159,743  |  162,698   \nDiluted  |  159,804  |  162,398  |  160,713  |  162,698   \nWeighted average shares outstanding for Adjusted Net Income   \nBasic  |  159,804  |  162,398  |  159,743  |  162,698   \nDiluted  |  161,113  |  165,850  |  160,713  |  166,557   \n(1) |  Adjusted Earnings Per Share is calculated under the two-class method.
