and Analysis (“MD&A”) provides an insight of the financial performance of\nAble Global Berhad (“AGB”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (“FYE\n2023”). This MD&A also contains information on the Group’s overview of business and operations, current financial\nposition, reviewing of operating activities, assessing the operational risks faced by the Group and discussing the future\nprospect of the Group.\n1. OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nA. Business and Operations\nAGB was incorporated in Malaysia on 22nd November 2000. It was subsequently listed on the Second\nBoard of Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange in 2003 and transferred to the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia\nSecurities Berhad in 2006.\nAGB is an investment holding company with its subsidiaries engaging in Tin Cans Manufacturing (“Tin\nCans”) and the Food and Beverage (“F&B”) segments. The Tin Cans segment involves manufacturing\nof various tins, cans and other containers and providing tinplates printing services. The F&B segment\ninvolves manufacturing and selling of milk and other related dairy products, as well as packing and\ntrading of all types of dairy products.\nFor Tin Cans segment, most of the customers are locally based, with minor market share in Singapore.\nThe customer base consists of various industries mainly in biscuit, paint and chemical, edible oil and\nfood processing industries. As for the tinplates printing services, most of the printing services are\nexported within South-East Asia market as well as local market.\nWhilst for F&B segment, approximately 80% of the dairy products are exported, mainly to West\nAfrica, South-East Asia Region and American Continent. The dairy products comprise of sweetened\ncondensed milk, evaporated milk, UHT full cream plus flavoured milk as well as milk powder packed in\nboth bulk and consumer packs.\n2. REVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nFor FYE 2023, the Group achieved revenue of RM648.09 million as compared to RM549.82 million in the\nprevious financial year, an increase of RM98.27 million. Profit before tax increased by RM26.39 million to\nRM69.19 million as compared to RM42.80 million in the previous financial year.\nFor Tin Cans segment, the revenue decreased by RM6.95 million to RM117.18 million from RM124.13 million\nmainly due to lower sales demand in current year.\nAs for the F&B segment, the revenue increased by RM105.21 million to RM530.91 million from RM425.70\nmillion mainly due to the increase in the sales demand from the customers.\nProfit before tax of Tin Cans segment decreased by RM7.79 million to RM18.59 million from RM26.38 million\nis in line with the decrease in revenue and increase in cost of production in current year.\nFor F&B segment, the profit before tax increased by RM33.42 million to RM51.88 million from RM18.46\nmillion mainly due to the increase in sales demand in the current year.\nThe Group’s total assets in FYE 2023 increased by RM81.96 million to RM802.57 million from RM720.61\nmillion in the previous financial year. The increase in total assets was mainly from the increase in cash and\ncash equivalents generated from the operation.\n6\nAnnuAL REpORt 2023\nStatement On Management Discussion And Analysis\n(Cont’d)\n2. REVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (CONT’D)\nIn FYE 2023, the total borrowings increased by RM15.99 million to RM269.95 million from RM253.96 million\nmainly due to short term trade financings through trust receipts for the purchase of raw materials. Despite\nthe increase in total borrowings, the gearing ratio decreased by 2.05% to 61.00% from 63.05% due to the\nincrease in shareholders’ equity.\nOn the investors’ perspective, the return on equity increased by 3.48% to 11.82% from 8.34%. The return\non total assets increased by 1.86% to 6.52% from 4.66%. Both the increases of the returns are due to the\nincrease in profitability in FYE 2023.\nInterest coverage ratio is approximately 14 times in FYE 2023 as compared to 23 times in the previous\nfinancial year, which reflects the Group’s ability to pay off its debts against current year’s profit.\nAs for share information, the earnings per share (“EPS”) is 16.86 sen for the FYE 2023 as compared to 10.85\nsen in the previous financial year. The net assets per share (“NAPS”) increased by 13 sen to RM1.44 for FYE\n2023 against RM1.31 in the previous financial year. The price earnings (“PE”) ratio is 8.90 for FYE 2023 as\ncompared to 12.44 in the previous financial year. The share price in FYE 2023 and in the previous financial\nyear was at RM1.50 and RM1.35 respectively.\nThe summary of the financial indicators is highlighted on pages 2 to 5 of this Annual Report.\n3. REVIEW OF OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nThe main factors that affected the operating activities in the Tin Cans segment are fluctuation in raw materials\nprices and machineries maintenance.\nRaw material prices directly affect the profitability of the Group. To remain competitive, we have always\nstrived to provide the most competitive prices to our customers. The Management is actively monitoring the\nraw materials cost and engages with the customers on the selling price adjustments. The Management is\nalways vigilant in monitoring the cost of manufacturing to stay competitive in the industry and ensure that\nthis segment maintains its profitability.\nMaintenance is required for the existing machinery. The unique and scarcity of the spare parts is a challenge\nto the maintenance team when fixing the machineries of older models. To resolve these issues, the older\nmodel machineries are upgraded as necessary.\nFor F&B segment, the main factor that affected the operating activities was volatility in raw materials prices.\nThe prices of dairy and sugar remain volatile and it will affect the manufacturing costs significantly. This\nposes a challenge to the Management in inventory control and procurement management. As such, the\nmanagement is in constant contacts and dialogues with the suppliers and traders to gauge the situation of\nthe market in order to make the procurement decisions.\n7\nABLE GLOBAL BERHAD\nStatement On Management Discussion And Analysis\n(Cont’d)\n4. REVIEW OF OPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe following are the main factors that may affect the operational risks of the Group:\nA. Business Risk\nThe Group’s revenue and operating results could be adversely affected by many factors which include,\namongst others, the costs of raw materials, costs of labour as well as maintenance costs of equipment\nand machineries.\nThe Group attempts to mitigate these risks by continuously monitoring the prices of key raw materials,\nexpanding the pool of suppliers and customers whilst continuing to establish long-term business\nrelationship with the existing suppliers and customers, expanding the existing business by enhancing\nthe Group’s strength and developing new products. However, we cannot provide any assurance that\nthe above-mentioned measures will be successful in mitigating the adverse effect of business risks\nmentioned on the materiality of the financial position and performance of the Group.\nB. Political, Economic and Regulatory Considerations\nThe Group’s business, prospects, financial condition and level of profitability may be affected by\ndevelopments in the economic, political and regulatory environment in Malaysia and other countries\nin which the Group’s products have market presence. Any adverse developments or uncertainties in\nthese factors could materially or adversely affect the profitability and business prospects of the Group.\nPolitical and economic uncertainties include but not limited to risk of war, global economic downturn,\nexpropriation, nationalisation, changes in political leadership, changes in investment policies,\nunfavourable changes in government policies such as changes in interest rates, method of taxation,\nexchange controls or the introduction of new regulations, import duties and tariffs and re-negotiation\nor nullification of existing contracts.\nThe Group will continue to adopt effective measures such as prudent management and efficient\noperating procedures to mitigate these factors that will affect the Group’s business.\nC. Competition Risks\nThe Group faces competition from both new entrants and existing players which offer similar products.\nHigh product quality, manufacturing efficiency, marketing, reasonable pricing and ranges of products\nare critical factors towards ensuring the success and sustainability of the business.\nThe Group will continue to take strategic measures and continuous review of the operational efficiency\nto move ahead of competition by addressing the factors above. Whereas for the F&B segment, the\nbarriers to entry are mainly the relative high capital investment to set up the manufacturing facilities,\nestablished distribution channels, compliance with stringent safety standards and strong research and\ndevelopment capabilities.\nAs the Group already has existing manufacturing plants with established distribution channels, the\nGroup does not foresee immediate threat of new entrants that will significantly affect the Group’s\nbusiness. The Group hopes to be able to maintain its market share.\nD. Foreign Exchange Risks\nThe Group is exposed to foreign exchange risks on sales and purchases that are denominated in a\ncurrency other than RM. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily in USD.\nThe Group will continue to evaluate the need of utilising financial instruments to hedge the currency\nexposure, taking into consideration the currency involved, exposure period and transaction costs.\nThere can be no assurance that any change in exchange rates will not have a material or adverse effect\non the financial position and performance of the Group.\n8\nAnnuAL REpORt 2023\nStatement On Management Discussion And Analysis\n(Cont’d)\n4. REVIEW OF OPERATIONAL RISKS (CONT’D)\nThe following are the main factors that may affect the operational risks of the Group: (Cont’d)\nE. Dependence on Key Management and Skilled Personnel\nThe Group’s continued success will depend upon, to a certain extent, the skills, experiences, abilities\nand continued efforts of the key management personnel. The loss of key management personnel in the\nGroup may have an adverse impact on the performance of the Group.\nThe Group recognises the importance of attracting and retaining the key management personnel to\nsupport the business operations. The Group presently has in place, human resources strategies which\ninclude providing competitive and performance-based remuneration and providing employees with a\nvariety of on-going training programmes to upgrade their knowledge and capabilities.\nHowever, we cannot provide any assurance that the above measures will be successful in attracting\nand retaining the key management personnel.\n5. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nMoving forward into year 2024, the Group is of the opinion that the businesses will begin to normalise amidst\nthe volatility of raw material prices and inflationary pressure.\nFor Tin Cans segment, demand is expected to grow marginally in this matured and stable industry but will\nremain challenging in the short-term. Raw materials costs are fluctuating and creating a challenging business\nenvironment and will put additional pressure on the profit margin in the short term.\nOn the other hand, the demand for F&B segment remains strong although the market is highly competitive.\nThe continued volatility of dairy products prices and the higher sugar price create a challenging environment\nto the dairy businesses in both the local and export market. However, the Group believes that this business\nsegment will still be able to sustain its profitability.\nRegarding the Group’s joint venture in Mexico, the Group has started exporting some products from its\nfacility during the year.\nAs for the Group’s property development segment, the acquisition of freehold land measuring a total of\n297.51 acres located at Lot 5049, District Kuala Langat is at the stage of conversion exercise and the\ndevelopment order is underway. The Group will commence the planning of property development activities\nupon the development order being obtained.\nBarring any unforeseen circumstances, the Board believes that the overall prospects and future financial\nperformance of the Group is expected to be favourable in the mid-term.\nThe Group, although without a dividend policy, intends to declare dividends depending on the Group’s\nprofits generated during each financial period/year, by taking into consideration the expansion plan and\nfuture investments on capital expenditure. For FYE 2023, the total dividends of 6.50 sen (2022: 4.0 sen)\nper ordinary share had been declared and paid to the shareholders amounting to RM19.99 million (2022:\nRM12.30 million). Dividend yield increased by 1.37% from 2.96% to 4.33%.\nThis forward-looking statement is based on current expectations and assumptions made by the Board\nthrough the analysis of historical information and trends. The Board is under no obligation to and expressly\ndisclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new\ninformation, subsequent events or otherwise.\nThis statement is made in accordance with a Board resolution dated 8 April 2024.\n9\nABLE GLOBAL BERHAD\nCoRPoRAte\nInFoRmaTIon\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\nMR.

then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial\nReporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.\nBasis for Opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards\non Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for\nthe Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nIndependence and Other Ethical Responsibilities\nWe are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics,\nConduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics\nStandards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International\nIndependence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance\nwith the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.\nKey Audit Matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit\nof the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were\naddressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and\nin forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nWe have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.\nGoodwill Impairment\nRefer to Note 11 to the financial statements\nKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter\nWe focused on this area because the Group carries Our procedures included, amongst others:-\nsignificant goodwill.\n• Reviewed the reasonableness of assumptions, either\nThe Group’s assessment of impairment of goodwill individually or as a whole, provide a reasonable basis\nis a judgmental process which requires estimates for the fair value measurements and disclosures.\nconcerning the forecast future cash flows\n• Determined the method of valuation chosen by\nassociated with the goodwill held in determining\nmanagement is appropriate and identify if there are\nthe value in use.\nany indicators of possible management bias.\n• Developed stress tests on certain key assumptions\nused and assess the range estimate for all ‘reasonable\noutcomes’.\n• Established that if there is any foreseeable reasonable\npossible change in key assumptions that will trigger\nthe recoverable amount to be lower than the carrying\namount.\n60\nAnnuAl RepoRt 2023\nIndependent Auditors’ Report\nTo The Members Of Able Global Berhad\n(Cont’d)\nKey Audit Matters (Cont’d)\nImpairment of Trade Receivables\nRefer to Note 14 to the financial statements\nKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter\nWe focused on this area because the Group Our procedures included, amongst others:-\ncarries significant amount of RM 88,560,561 • Tested the reliability and accuracy of ageing report.\ntrade receivables as at financial year end.

The other information comprises the\ninformation included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the\nCompany and our auditors’ report thereon.\nOur opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and\nwe do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to\nread the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with\nthe financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise\nappears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this\nauditors’ report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to\nreport that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the\nCompany that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International\nFinancial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The directors are also\nresponsible for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial\nstatements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or\nerror.\nIn preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the directors are responsible for assessing\nthe Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related\nto going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate\nthe Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n61\nABle GloBAl BeRHAD\nIndependent Auditors’ Report\nTo The Members Of Able Global Berhad\n(Cont’d)\nAuditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the\nCompany as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’\nreport that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that\nan audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards\non Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error\nand are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the\neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards\non Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We\nalso:-\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the\nCompany, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,\nand obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not\ndetecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud\nmay involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are\nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of\nthe Group’s and the Company’s internal control.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates\nand related disclosures made by the directors.\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that\nmay cast significant doubt on the Group’s or the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the\nrelated disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are\ninadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date\nof our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease\nto continue as a going concern.\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the\nCompany, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company\nrepresent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business\nactivities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible\nfor the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit\nopinion.\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and\nsignificant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding\nindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought\nto bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in\nthe audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore\nthe key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public\ndisclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be\ncommunicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to\noutweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n62\nAnnuAl RepoRt 2023\nIndependent Auditors’ Report\nTo The Members Of Able Global Berhad\n(Cont’d)\nOTHER MATTERS\nThis report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the\nCompanies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose.

GENERAL INFORMATION\nThe Company is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia. The registered\noffice and principal place of business are as follows:-\nRegistered office: Suite 1301, 13th Floor, City Plaza\nJalan Tebrau\n80300 Johor Bahru\nJohor\nPrincipal place of business : PTD 124298, Jalan Kempas Lama\nKampung Seelong Jaya\n81300 Skudai\nJohor\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries\nmade up to the end of the reporting period.\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”), which is the Company’s\nfunctional and presentation currency.\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors in accordance with a resolution\nof the directors dated 8 April 2024.\n2. PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\nThe Company is principally engaged in the business of investment holding and the provision of management\nservices. The principal activities of the subsidiaries are set out in Note 5 to the financial statements. There\nhave been no significant changes in the nature of these activities during the financial year.\n3. BASIS OF PREPARATION\nThe financial statements of the Group are prepared under the historical cost convention and modified to\ninclude other bases of valuation as disclosed in other sections under material accounting policy information,\nand in compliance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (“MFRSs”), International Financial Reporting\nStandards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.\n3.1 During the current financial year, the Group has adopted the following new accounting standards and/\nor interpretations (including the consequential amendments, if any):-\nMFRSs and/or IC Interpretations (Including The Consequential Amendments)\nMFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\nAmendments to MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\nAmendment to MFRS 17 : Initial Application of MFRS 17 and MFRS 9 – Comparative Information\nAmendments to MFRS 101 : Disclosure of Accounting Policies\nAmendments to MFRS 108 : Definition of Accounting Estimates\nAmendments to MFRS 112 : Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single\nTransaction\nAmendments to MFRS 112 : International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules\nThe adoption of the above accounting standard(s) and/or interpretation(s) (including the consequential\namendments, if any) did not have any material impact on the financial statements of the Group.\n73\nABle GloBAl BeRHAD\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n3. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONT’D)\n3.2 The Group has not applied in advance the following accounting standards and/or interpretation(s)\n(including the consequential amendments, if any) that have been issued by the Malaysian Accounting\nStandards Board (MASB) but are not yet effective for the current financial year:-\nMFRSs and/or IC Interpretations (Including The Consequential Amendments) Effective Date\nAmendments to MFRS 10 : Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Deferred\nand MFRS 128 Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture\nAmendments to MFRS 16 : Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback 1 January 2024\nAmendments to MFRS 101 : Classification of Liabilities as Current or 1 January 2024\nNon-current\nAmendments to MFRS 101 : Non-current Liabilities with Covenants 1 January 2024\nAmendments to MFRS 107 : Supplier Finance Arrangements 1 January 2024\nand MFRS 7\nAmendments to MFRS 121 : Lack of Exchangeability 1 January 2025\nThe adoption of the above accounting standard(s) and/or interpretation(s) (including the consequential\namendments, if any) is expected to have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group\nupon their initial application.\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\n4.1 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\nKey Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\nManagement believes that there are no key assumptions made concerning the future, and other key\nsources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material\nadjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year other than as\ndisclosed below:-\n(a) Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment\nThe estimates for the residual values, useful lives and related depreciation charges for the property,\nplant and equipment are based on commercial factors which could change significantly as a\nresult of technical innovations and competitors’ actions in response to the market conditions. The\nGroup anticipates that the residual values of its property, plant and equipment will be insignificant.\nAs a result, residual values are not being taken into consideration for the computation of the\ndepreciable amount. Changes in the expected level of usage and technological development\ncould impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, therefore future\ndepreciation charges could be revised. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment as\nat the reporting date is disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements.\n(b) Impairment of Goodwill\nThe assessment of whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the\ncash-generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value in use amount requires\nmanagement to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating\nunit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those\ncash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill as at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 11 to\nthe financial statements.\n74\nAnnuAl RepoRt 2023\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D)\n4.1 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements (Cont’d)\nKey Sources of Estimation Uncertainty (Cont’d)\n(c) Write-down of Inventories\nReviews are made periodically by management on damaged, obsolete and slow-moving\ninventories. These reviews require judgement and estimates. Possible changes in these estimates\ncould result in revisions to the valuation of inventories. The carrying amount of inventories as at\nthe reporting date is disclosed in Note 12 to the financial statements.\n(d) Impairment of Trade Receivables\nThe Group uses the simplified approach to estimate a lifetime expected credit loss allowance\nfor all trade receivables (other than related parties and joint ventures). The Group develops the\nexpected loss rates based on the payment profiles of past sales and the corresponding historical\ncredit losses, and adjusts for qualitative and quantitative reasonable and supportable forward-\nlooking information. If the expectation is different from the estimation, such difference will impact\nthe carrying value of trade receivables (other than related parties and joint ventures). The carrying\namounts of trade receivables as at the reporting date are disclosed in Note 14 to the financial\nstatements.\n(e) Income Taxes\nThere are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination may be\ndifferent from the initial estimate. The Group recognises tax liabilities based on its understanding\nof the prevailing tax laws and estimates of whether such taxes will be due in the ordinary course\nof business. When the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were\ninitially recognised, such difference will impact the income tax expense and deferred tax balances\nin the period in which such determination is made. The carrying amounts of current tax assets\nand current tax liabilities of the Group as at the reporting date are RM1,287,469 and RM1,349,332\n(2022: RM8,880,493 and RM148,915).\n(f) Discount Rates Used in Leases\nWhere the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the\nincremental borrowing rate to measure the lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate is the\ninterest rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, the funds necessary\nto obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.\nTherefore, the incremental borrowing rate requires estimation particularly when no observable\nrates are available or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of\nthe lease. The Group estimates the incremental borrowing rate using observable inputs when\navailable and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates.\nCritical Judgements made in Applying Accounting Policies\nManagement believes that there are no instances of application of critical judgement in applying the\nGroup’s accounting policies which will have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the\nfinancial statements other than as disclosed below:-\nLease Terms\nSome leases contain extension options exercisable by the Group before the end of the non- cancellable\ncontract period. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances\nincluding the past practice and any cost that will be incurred to change the asset if an option to extend\nis not taken. An extension option is only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to\nbe extended (or not terminated).\n75\nABle GloBAl BeRHAD\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D)\n4.2 Financial Instruments\n(a) Financial Assets\nFinancial Assets Through Profit or Loss\nThe financial assets are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the\nfinancial assets are remeasured to their fair values at the reporting date with fair value changes\nrecognised in profit or loss. The fair value changes do not include interest and dividend income.\nFinancial Assets at Amortised Cost\nThe financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs except for trade\nreceivables without significant financing component which are measured at transaction price\nonly. Subsequent to the initial recognition, all financial assets are measured at amortised cost less\nany impairment losses.\nFinancial Assets Through Other Comprehensive Income\nThe Group has elected to designate the equity instruments as financial assets through other\ncomprehensive income at initial recognition.\nThe financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequent to the\ninitial recognition, the financial assets are remeasured to their fair values at the reporting date\nwith fair value changes taken up in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the fair\nvalue reserve, except for the recognition of impairment, interest income and foreign exchange\ndifference of a debt instrument which are recognised directly in profit or loss. The fair value\nchanges do not include interest and dividend income.\n(b) Financial Liabilities\nFinancial Liabilities Through Profit or Loss\nThe financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the\nfinancial liabilities are remeasured to their fair values at the reporting date with fair value changes\nrecognised in profit or loss except for the component of fair value changes relating to own credit\nrisk is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The fair value changes do not include\ninterest expense.\nFinancial Liabilities at Amortised Cost\nThe financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequent to\nthe initial recognition, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.\n(c) Equity\nOrdinary Shares\nOrdinary shares are recorded on initial recognition at the proceeds received less directly\nattributable transaction costs incurred. The ordinary shares are not remeasured subsequently.\n76\nAnnuAl RepoRt 2023\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D)\n4.2 Financial Instruments (Cont’d)\n(c) Equity (Cont’d)\nTreasury Shares\nTreasury shares are recorded on initial recognition at the consideration paid less directly\nattributable transaction costs incurred. The treasury shares are not remeasured subsequently.\nNo gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the\ntreasury shares. If such shares are issued by resale, any difference between the sales consideration\nreceived and the carrying amount of the treasury shares is recognised in equity. Where treasury\nshares are cancelled, their carrying amounts are shown as a movement in retained profits.\n(d) Derivatives\nDerivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the derivatives\nare remeasured to their fair values at the reporting date with fair value changes recognised in\nprofit or loss.\n(e) Financial Guarantee Contracts\nFinancial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as liabilities at fair value, net of transaction\ncosts. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial guarantee contracts are recognised as\nincome in profit or loss over the period of the guarantee or, when there is no specific contractual\nperiod, recognised in profit or loss upon discharge of the guarantee. If the debtor fails to make\npayment relating to a financial guarantee contract when it is due and the Company, as the issuer,\nis required to reimburse the holder for the associated loss, the reimbursement is recognised\nas a liability and measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined using\nthe expected credit loss model and the amount of financial guarantee initially recognised less\ncumulative amortisation.\n4.3 Goodwill\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the goodwill is measured at\ncost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. A bargain purchase gain is recognised in profit or loss\nimmediately.\n4.4 Investments In Subsidiaries\nInvestments in subsidiaries, which are eliminated on consolidation, are stated in the separate financial\nstatements of the Company at cost less impairment losses, if any.\n4.5 Investments In Joint Ventures\nInvestments in joint ventures are stated in the separate financial statements of the Company at cost\nless impairment losses, if any. The Group recognises its interest in the joint ventures using the equity\nmethod in the consolidated financial statements.\n77\nABle GloBAl BeRHAD\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D)\n4.6 Property, Plant and Equipment\nAll items of property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost.\nSubsequent to the initial recognition, all property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and\nbuildings, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\nFreehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other property, plant and equipment is calculated\nusing the straight-line method to allocate their depreciable amounts over the estimated useful lives.\nThe principal annual depreciation rates are:-\nFactory buildings 2%\nPlant and machineries 10%\nMoulds, tools and factory equipments 10%\nElectrical installations and substation 10%\nMotor vehicles 20%\nOffice equipment, furniture and fittings 10 - 20%\nRenovation 10%\nCapital work-in-progress represent plant and machineries under installation. They are not depreciated\nuntil such time when the asset is available for use.\n4.7 Investment Properties\nInvestment properties are initially measured at cost. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the investment\nproperties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\nFreehold land is not depreciated.\n4.8 Right-of-use Assets and Lease Liabilities\n(a) Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-value Assets\nThe Group applies the “short-term lease” and “lease of low-value assets” recognition exemption.\nFor these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-\nline method over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.\n(b) Right-of-use Assets\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at cost. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the right-\nof-use assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment\nlosses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\nThe right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement\ndate to the earlier of the end of the estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of\nthe lease term.\n(c) Lease Liabilities\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not\npaid at the commencement date, discounted using the entities’ incremental borrowing rate.\nSubsequent to the initial recognition, the lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost and\nadjusted for any lease reassessment or modifications.\n4.9 Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the first-in,\nfirst-out method (tin manufacturing segment) and weighted average cost method (food and beverage\nsegment) and comprises all costs of purchase, cost of conversion plus other costs incurred in bringing\nthe inventories to their present location and condition.\n78\nAnnuAl RepoRt 2023\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D)\n4.10 Property Development Costs\nProperty development costs are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises\ncost associated with the purchase of land, conversion fees, aggregate cost of development, materials\nand supplies, wages and other direct expenses, an appropriate proportion of common infrastructure\ncosts, and borrowings cost capitalised.\nThe property development costs of unsold units are transferred to inventories once the development is\ncompleted.\n5.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe activities of the Group and of the Company are exposed to a variety of market risk (including foreign\ncurrency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The overall financial risk\nmanagement policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential\nadverse effects on the financial performance of the Group and the Company.\n44.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES\nThe policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are as follows:-\n(a) Market Risk\n(i) Foreign Currency Risk\nThe Group and the Company are exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and\nbalances that are denominated in currencies other than Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”). The\ncurrencies giving rise to this risk are primarily United States Dollar (“USD”), Euro (“EUR”)\nand Singapore Dollar (“SGD”). Foreign currency risk is monitored closely on an ongoing\nbasis to ensure that the net exposure is at an acceptable level. On occasion, the Group\nenters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge against its foreign currency risk.\nThe Group also holds cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies for\nworking capital purposes.\nThe exposure to foreign currency risk (a currency which is other than the functional currency\nof the entities within the Group) based on the carrying amounts of the financial instruments\nat the end of the reporting period is summarised below:-\n118\nAnnuAl RepoRt 2023\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n44.

The exposure to interest rate\nrisk arises mainly from borrowings with variable rates. The Group and the Company adopt\na policy of obtaining the most favourable interest rates available and by maintaining a\nbalanced portfolio mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.\nThe fixed rate debt instruments of the Group and of the Company are not subject to interest\nrate risk since neither the carrying amounts nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because\nof a change in market interest rates.\nThe exposure to interest rate risk based on the carrying amounts of the financial instruments\nat the end of the reporting period is disclosed in Note 24 to the financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis\nAny reasonably possible change in the interest rates of floating rate term loans at the end\nof the reporting period does not have material impact on the profit after taxation and equity\nof the Group and of the Company and hence, no sensitivity analysis is presented.\nThere is no impact on the Group’s equity.\nThe Company does not have any floating rate borrowings and hence, no sensitivity analysis\nis presented.\n121\nABle GloBAl BeRHAD\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n44. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT’D)\n44.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (CONT’D)\n(a) Market Risk (Cont’d)\n(iii) Equity Price Risk\nThe Group and the Company do not have any quoted investments and hence, are not\nexposed to equity price risk.\n(b) Credit Risk\nThe exposure to credit risk, or the risk of counterparties defaulting, arises mainly from trade\nand other receivables. The Group and the Company manage their exposure to credit risk by the\napplication of credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures on an ongoing basis. For\nother financial assets (including cash and bank balances and derivatives), the Group and the\nCompany minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties.\nAlso, the Company’s exposure to credit risk includes loans and advances to subsidiaries,\nand corporate guarantee given to financial institutions for credit facilities granted to certain\nsubsidiaries. The Company monitors the ability of the subsidiaries to serve their loans on an\nindividual basis.\n(i) Credit Risk Concentration Profile\nThe Group’s major concentration of credit risk relates to the amounts owing by 1 (2022:\n1) customer which constituted approximately 22% (2022: 16%) of its trade receivables\n(including related parties and joint ventures) at the end of the reporting period.\nIn addition, the Group also determines concentration of credit risk by monitoring the\ngeographical region of its trade receivables (including related parties and joint ventures) on\nan ongoing basis. The credit risk concentration profile of trade receivables (including related\nparties and joint ventures) at the end of the reporting period is as follows:-\nThe Group\n2023 2022\nRM RM\nAfrica 6,301,824 7,211,023\nAsia 10,540,469 8,853,402\nAmerica 26,880,746 13,162,469\nSingapore 3,647,395 3,657,574\nMalaysia 41,189,601 35,589,112\nMexico 7,497,146 4,831,860\nMiddle East 526 –\nPhilipines – 2,576,645\n96,057,707 75,882,085\n122\nAnnuAl RepoRt 2023\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n44. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT’D)\n44.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (CONT’D)\n(b) Credit Risk (Cont’d)\n(ii) Maximum Exposure to Credit Risk\nAt the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the\ncarrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised in the statements of financial\nposition of the Group and of the Company after deducting any allowance for impairment\nlosses (where applicable).\nIn addition, the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk also includes corporate\nguarantees provided to its subsidiaries as disclosed under the ‘Maturity Analysis’ of item (c)\nbelow, representing the outstanding banking facilities of the subsidiaries as at the end of the\nreporting period. These corporate guarantees have not been recognised in the Company’s\nfinancial statements since their fair value on initial recognition were not material.\n(iii) Assessment of Impairment Losses\nThe Group and the Company have an informal credit policy in place and the exposure to\ncredit risk is monitored on an on-going basis through periodic review of the ageing of the\nreceivables. The Group and the Company closely monitor the receivables’ financial strength\nto reduce the risk of loss.\nAt each reporting date, the Group and the Company evaluate whether any of the financial\nassets at amortised cost are credit impaired.\nThe gross carrying amounts of financial assets are written off against the associated\nimpairment, if any, when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery despite the fact\nthat they are still subject to enforcement activities.\nA financial asset is credit impaired when any of following events that have a detrimental\nimpact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred:-\n- Significant financial difficulty of the receivable;\n- A breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;\n- Restructuring of a debt in relation to the receivable’s financial difficulty;\n- It is becoming probable that the receivable will enter bankruptcy or other financial\nreorganisation.\nThe Group and the Company consider a receivable to be in default when the receivable is\nunlikely to repay its debt to the Group and the Company in full or is more than 90 days past\ndue unless the Group and the Company have reasonable and supportable information to\ndemonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.

The historical loss rates for certain subsidiaries were adjusted to reflect\ncurrent and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of\nthe trade receivables to settle their debts using the linear regressive analysis. The Group\nhas identified the unemployment rate and inflation rate as the key macroeconomic factors\nof the forward-looking information for certain subsidiaries. However, the historical loss rates\nof remaining subsidiaries were not adjusted as they have not identified any forward-looking\nassumptions which correlate to the historical loss rates.\nThere are no significant changes in the estimation techniques and assumptions as compared\nto the previous financial year.\nAllowance for Impairment Losses\nLifetime Lifetime\nGross Individual Collective Carrying\nAmount Allowance Allowance Amount\nRM RM RM RM\nThe Group\n2023\nCurrent (not past due) 59,738,270 – (3,509) 59,734,761\n1 to 30 days past due 8,663,465 – (3,352) 8,660,113\n31 to 60 days past due 9,049,907 – (3,766) 9,046,141\n61 to 90 days past due 4,879,784 (83,403) (3,731) 4,792,650\nCredit impaired 5,757,540 (3,709,072) (4,850) 2,043,618\n88,088,966 (3,792,475) (19,208) 84,277,283\n124\nAnnuAl RepoRt 2023\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n44.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT’D)\n44.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (CONT’D)\n(b) Credit Risk (Cont’d)\n(iii) Assessment of Impairment Losses (Cont’d)\nOther Receivables\nThe Group and the Company apply the 3-stage general approach to measuring expected\ncredit losses for its other receivables.\nUnder this approach, loss allowance is measured on either 12-month expected credit\nlosses or lifetime expected credit losses, by considering the likelihood that the receivable\nwould not be able to repay during the contractual period (probability of default, PD), the\npercentage of contractual cash flows that will not be collected if default happens (loss\ngiven default, LGD) and the outstanding amount that is exposed to default risk (exposure at\ndefault, EAD).\nIn deriving the PD and LGD, the Group and the Company consider the receivable’s past\npayment status and its financial condition as at the reporting date. The PD is adjusted to\nreflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the\nability of the receivable to settle its debts.\nAllowance for Impairment Losses\nNo expected credit loss is recognised on other receivables as it is negligible.\nCash and Bank Balances\nThe Group and the Company consider the licensed banks have low credit risks. In addition,\nsome of the bank balances are insured by Government agencies. Therefore, the Group\nand the Company are of the view that the loss allowance is immaterial and hence, it is not\nprovided for.\nAmount Owing By Subsidiaries (Trade and Non-trade Balances)\nThe Company applies the 3-stage general approach to measuring expected credit losses\nfor all inter-company balances.\nInputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses\nThe Company measures the expected credit losses on individual basis, which is aligned\nwith its credit risk management practices on the inter-company balances.\nThe Company considers loans and advances to subsidiaries have low credit risks. The\nCompany assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary’s\nfinancial position deteriorates significantly.\nFor loans and advances that are repayable on demand, impairment loss is assessed based\non the assumption that repayment of the outstanding balances is demanded at the reporting\ndate. If the subsidiary does not have sufficient highly liquid resources when the loans and\nadvances are demanded, the Company will consider the expected manner of recovery to\nmeasure the impairment loss; the recovery manner could be either through ‘repayable over\ntime’ or a fire sale of less liquid assets by the subsidiary.\n127\nABle GloBAl BeRHAD\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n44.

A financial guarantee contract is credit impaired\nwhen:-\n- The subsidiary is unlikely to repay its obligation to the bank in full; or\n- The subsidiary is having a deficit in equity and is continuously loss making.\nThe Company determines the probability of default of the guaranteed amounts individually\nusing internal information available.\nAllowance for Impairment Losses\nAll of the financial guarantee contracts are considered to be performing, have low risks of\ndefault and historically there were no instances where these financial guarantee contracts\nwere called upon by the parties of which the financial guarantee contracts were issued to.\nAccordingly, no loss allowances were identified based on 12-month expected credit losses.\n(c) Liquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk arises mainly from general funding and business activities. The Group and the\nCompany practise prudent risk management by maintaining sufficient cash balances and the\navailability of funding through certain committed credit facilities.\n129\nABle GloBAl BeRHAD\nNotes To The Financial Statements\nFor The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023\n(Cont’d)\n44.
