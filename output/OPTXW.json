Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of future performance of Syntec Optics or that actual results will not differ materially from the results presented in theprospective financial\ninformation contained in this Presentation. Actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated by the projected financial information contained in this Presentation. The inclusion of such information in this Presentation shouldnot be regarded as a representation by any person that the results\nreflected in such projections will be achieved.\nFinancial Information; Non-GAAP Measures\nCertain financial information and data contained in this Presentation is unaudited and may not conform to Regulation S-X. Such information and data may not be included in, and may be adjusted in or may be presented differently in the registration statement to be filed relating to the proposed Transaction\nand proxy statement/prospectus contained therein.\nThis Presentation also includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) including, but not limited to, Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures, and other measures that are calculated using these non-GAAP measures, are\nnot measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing the Company's financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows from operations or other\nmeasures of profitability, liquidity, or performance under GAAP. You should be aware that the Company's presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful\ninformation to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial conditions and results of operations. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use and evaluating\nongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company's financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments\nby management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.\nThis Presentation may also include certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures. Due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from these projected measures, together with some of the excluded information not being\nascertainable were accessible, the Company is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\nTrademarks\nSyntec Optics may own or have rights to various trademarks, service marks and trade names that they use in connection with the operation of their respective businesses. This Presentation may also contain trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights of other companies, which are the property of\ntheir respective owners.

This information involves many assumptions and limitations, therefore, there can be no guarantee as to the accuracy or reliability of such assumptions and you are cautioned not to give\nundue weight to this information.

(Nasdaq: OPTX) Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\n## Syntec continues sequential revenue growth with positive EBITDA\n\nNovember 14, 2024 16:37 ET | Source:  [Syntec Optics](/en/search/organization/Syntec%2520Optics) Follow Syntec Optics\n\nShare\n\nROCHESTER, NEW YORK, Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Syntec Optics (Nasdaq: OPTX), a leading provider of mission-critical products to advanced technology defense, biomedical, and communications equipment manufacturers, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Net Sales of $7.86 million increased by 12.3% from $7.01 million in Q2 2024, and sales from products of $7.33 million increased by 17.2% from $6.26 million in Q3 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $1.10 million from $1.32 million in Q2 2024.\n  * Earnings per Share decreased to $0.00 from $0.01 in Q2 2024.\n\n\n\nDean Rudy, CFO, said, “At the previous earnings call, we provided guidance for the third quarter 2024 revenue to be between $9.5 and $11.0 million. Our revenues came in below this projection at $7.86 million but 12.3% higher than the prior quarter, showing sequential growth. The company ramped up data center connectivity products for increased Artificial Intelligence deployment and continued its production of currently deployed night vision optics and opto-mechanicals, mission-critical biomedical products, space optics, and other diverse products.”\n\n**Strong End-Market Expansion:**\n\n  * Continued production of space optics for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Satellite broadband could represent a significant portion of the [_$1 trillion_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JYV1hIHeTfGBVsbifBVrsu4RMubG9AklW4MtX06IWhKbmkSgOkmW_xfmRhGQJiFcHw5j_IFshRAMgaIitZwn-eN9usoBTQSzNfwxytwttyv6cro4OStb0kDAe2uHuF1P9NXMvjXXIQzEsP9SkdGA8Q==) global space economy by 2040.\n  * Ramped up production to nearly triple the quantity per week for the high-growth data center market driven by the deployment of Artificial Intelligence.

The overall sales increased by 19.2% compared to $6.60 million in Q3 2023, and sales from products increased by 19.9% as the company shifts from development to production ramp-up.\n\nThe increase in net sales compared to the prior year is due to increases in our product revenue stream. Product revenue increased by $1.1 million for the three months ended 2024 compared to 2023, a 17.2% increase.\n\nThe third quarter of 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $1.10 million for the three months ending 2024, compared to $1.32 million adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.30 million in 2023. Contributing factors to the decrease over the previous quarter were a reduction in gross profit of $0.3 million, a reduction in other income of $0.3 million, and offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $0.3 million. Contributing factors to the year-over-year decrease include a $0.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses to enable future product launches.\n\nThe Company ended the third quarter of 2024 with an unused $3.9 million line of credit, an unused $4.8 million equipment line of credit, and a paydown of 3.3% principal on other commercial bank lines.\n\nOur net income for the three months ended in the third quarter of 2024 was a negative $0.01 million, or $0.00 per share, down from $0.3 million or negative $0.01 per share for Q2 2024, and compared to $0.4 million, or $0.01 per share, for Q3 2023.\n\n**Guidance**\n\nOur recent increases in ongoing sales into the communications, medical, and defense industries are expected to accelerate in the third quarter, particularly within our space communications optics and datacom microlens arrays. As such, the fourth quarter 2024 revenue is expected to be in the range of $7.4 - $9.0 million. \n\nWe expect our gross margin to hold level or slightly improve based on the profitability of ramping up products. General and administrative costs are expected to increase modestly to enable ramped-up engineering, quality, and pilot production to support continued growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nLooking to the first quarter of 2025, we anticipate continued strength from the communications and biomedical end-markets, with additional growth coming from defense-based product launches.\n\nOur products are propelled by tailwinds as we move towards laser-based satellite communications versus radar-based for low latency, biomedical automation, defense equipment modernization, and on-shoring. Mission-critical products use proprietary techniques that provide an economic moat.\n\nLastly, we expect positive net income in the fourth quarter, enabling further investments to energize our continued growth.\n\n**About Syntec Optics**\n\nSyntec Optics Holdings, Inc.

Adjusted non-GAAP measures exclude significant unusual items. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures as a supplement to, and not a substitute for financial information prepared on a GAAP basis.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis Annual Report includes a non-GAAP measure that the Company uses to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and other income, tax and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring items, and business combination expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we believe is useful to investors and analysts because it illustrates the underlying financial and business trends relating to our core, recurring results of operations and enhances comparability between periods.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and is not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry. Investors should exercise caution in comparing our non-GAAP measure to any similarly titled measure used by other companies. This non-GAAP measure excludes certain items required by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to information reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nThe Company defines adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net earnings (loss) before interest and other expenses, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to exclude non-recurring items as outlined in our 10-Q. The Company utilizes adjusted EBITDA as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe the exclusion of these non-cash and non-recurring charges allows for a more relevant comparison of our results of operations to other companies in our industry and is in accordance with the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Compliance & Disclosure Interpretations (Reference Question 102.03).\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZGJhNjFkZTktNzg0OC00MWEwLTkwMWYtMGEyMTUwMTljNTE3LTEyNzQ2ODk=/tiny/Syntec-Optics.png)\n\n## Tags\n\n[optics](/en/search/tag/optics

This manufacturing capability restart, which was innovated over two decades ago, further solidifies Syntec Optics’ position as a continued critical supplier of high-precision optical components for defense applications.\n\nSyntec Optics has been a trusted supplier to the program since 2004, delivering critical optical components and assemblies that have contributed to its success. In 2004, Syntec Optics received an excellence award for its significant contributions to the program. Consistent demand is anticipated over the next five years, starting with the fulfillment of initial orders received by the OEM.\n\nThis latest procurement effort builds on Syntec Optics’ strong track record of delivering innovative laser guidance optics solutions. The company’s state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and experienced engineering team enable the production of high-quality optical components with exceptional precision and reliability.\n\nThe guidance system, including a laser seeker, its optics, and mechanicals, is mounted on the munition. After the munition is launched near the target, it detects the direction of the laser energy from a marked target and adjusts the trajectory. These technologies enable increased precision with fewer munitions per target, thereby reducing collateral damage.\n\nSyntec Optics has been manufacturing advanced optical and optomechanical components and assemblies for the program. These components and sub-assembly are essential for precise guidance and targeting capabilities that use nose-mounted optics and a laser seeker with fins.\n\n“We are honored to continue contributing to a program that uses targeting precision to increase the success rate of missions,” said Beth Blood, Program Manager at Syntec Optics. “This opportunity underscores our commitment to delivering cutting-edge optical solutions that meet the evolving needs of the defense technology industry.”\n\nSyntec Optics remains dedicated to innovation and continuous improvement, ensuring its products meet smart optical technologies' highest quality and performance standards.\n\n**About Syntec Optics**\n\nSyntec Optics Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: OPTX), headquartered in Rochester, NY, is one of the largest custom and diverse end-market optics and photonics manufacturers in the United States. Operating for over two decades, Syntec Optics runs a state-of-the-art facility with extensive core capabilities of various optics manufacturing processes, both horizontally and vertically integrated, to provide a competitive advantage for mission-critical OEMs. Syntec Optics recently launched new products, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite optics, lightweight night vision goggle optics, biomedical equipment optics, and precision microlens arrays.
