We make such forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential”, “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.\n\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance, and are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n\n● | the sufficiency of our existing cash and cash equivalents to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months and our need to raise additional capital;  \n---|---  \n● | our ability to generate revenue from products;  \n● | our limited operating history;  \n● | our ability to maintain proper and effective internal financial controls;  \n● | our ability to continue to operate as a going concern;  \n● | changes in laws, government regulations and policies and interpretations thereof;  \n● | our ability to obtain and maintain protection for our intellectual property;  \n● | our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel;  \n● | our ability to manage our rapid growth and organizational change effectively;  \n● | the possibility of security vulnerabilities, cyberattacks and network disruptions, including breaches of data security and privacy leaks, data loss, and business interruptions;  \n● | our compliance with data privacy laws and regulations;  \n● | our ability to develop and maintain our brand cost-effectively; and  \n● | the other factors set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.  \n  \nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q and are subject to business and economic risks.

However, as of June 30, 2023, the Company determined that, pursuant to the definition provided in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, it no longer satisfied the criteria to be considered an FPI. Pursuant to section 6120 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) financial reporting manual (“FRM”) the Company was permitted to continue to use forms applicable to FPIs for the remainder of its fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. However, starting on January 1, 2024, the Company began using the forms prescribed for domestic registrants. Further, the Company filed a Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring January of 2023, the Company issued 65,750 or 1,315,000 ordinary shares, par value £0.0001 per share of Company, based on a price per share of £0.0001 on exercise of pre-funded warrants that had been issued in prior financing rounds. As the pre-funded warrants contained a nominal exercise price, the exercise of the pre-funded warrants resulted in nominal proceeds to the Company. On March 27, 2023, the Company, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 10,750 American Depository Shares (“ADSs”), or 215,000 ordinary shares, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 161,125 ADS (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), and Series C purchase warrants to purchase up to 171,875 ADSs (the “Ordinary Warrants” and together with the Pre-Funded Warrants and the ADSs, the “Securities”). In addition, the Company also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 12,891 ADSs. The purchase price for each ADS and associated Ordinary Warrants was $32 (on a post-split basis) and the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Ordinary Warrants was $31.98. The Ordinary Warrants were immediately exercisable, expire five (5) years from the date of issuance and the Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. The total net proceeds from this offering were approximately £4.0 million (or approximately $4.9 million), after deducting estimated offering expenses of approximately £0.5 million.\n\nOn March 27, 2023 the Company also agreed that certain existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 140,000 ADSs of the Company that were previously issued on November 30, 2022, at an exercise price of $100 (on a post-split basis) per ADS and expiration dates of May 30, 2025 and May 30, 2028, were amended so that the amended warrants had a reduced exercise price of $35 (on a post-split basis) per ADS.\n\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company issued 623,750 ADSs representing 12,475,000 ordinary shares of the Company upon exercise of outstanding warrants resulting in gross cash proceeds to the Company of £986,772 (approximately $1,263,000).\n\n**_Risks and Uncertainties_**\n\nThe Company is exposed to a variety of risks in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, currency risk, liquidity risk, equity price risk and credit risk. The Company regularly assesses each of these risks to minimize any adverse effects on the business as a result of those factors.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**_Going Concern_**\n\nThe Company has been focused on the development of therapeutic products based around its gamma delta T cell platform technology, with the objective of conducting clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy and eventually being granted regulatory approval to market and sell its products since its incorporation. This activity was expected to be in development for several years and has incurred considerable expenditures to date in research and development expenses and in conducting clinical trials. Similar to most development and/or clinical stage biotechnology companies, the Company has not yet generated any revenues from sales of products, but has obtained cash to finance its research, development and clinical trial activities from equity, debt and grant financings and from receipts from partners under collaborative co-development agreements. The Company is expected to continue in this clinical development phase for a number of years before any product becomes marketable. The Company therefore expects to continue to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to approximately £1.0 million. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of £0.6 million. Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was £2.4 million, and the Company expects to incur continued outflow of cash for the foreseeable future. Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was £3.3 million.\n\nSimilar to many clinical development stage biotechnology companies, the Company’s future liquidity needs, and ability to address them, will largely be determined by the availability of capital, both generally and in particular to fund product candidates and key development and regulatory projects. As a pre-revenue biotechnology Company, operations have been financed though continuously raising capital, and management expects to continue to raise capital routinely. The Company is currently and continuously progressing various funding options to fill the projected working capital gap, which could be in the form of an equity raise or other forms of financings such as debt funding, collaborations or licensing arrangements. Management believes that the ongoing financing initiatives should provide sufficient capital to finance planned operations through 2024, and thereafter we would expect to be in a position to raise significantly greater capital as the clinical program progresses. However, there can be no certainty that these initiatives will be successful and, if they are not, management will seek to deploy alternative plans, which could have a potentially significant negative impact on stockholder and asset value. Such plans could include all or any of the following: raising additional capital through low priced and/or complex equity and/or debt financings, entering transactions involving sales, joint venturing or licensing of intellectual property, reducing and/or deferring discretionary spending on research and development or clinical programs, restructuring our operating model to take advantage of our manufacturing capability to generate short term revenues or reducing our cash burn rate through reduction in planned operating costs.\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which assumes the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not established a source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, and as such, has been dependent on ongoing funding operations primarily through ongoing initiatives to raise capital. The Company expects to require substantially more capital to fund its clinical, development and operational requirements, and therefore incur further losses over the next several years as it develops its clinical products. The Company has utilized, and expects to continue to utilize, substantial amounts of funding to implement its business strategy. If the Company is unable to maintain adequate liquidity, future operations will need to be scaled back or discontinued. Based on these circumstances, management has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n**NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS**\n\n**_Basis of Presentation_**\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or for any future periods.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**_Principals of Consolidation_**\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TC BioPharm and its 100% controlled subsidiaries, TC BioPharm Limited, TC BioPharm Inc. and TC BioPharm BV. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. “TC BioPharm”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us” is intended to mean TC BioPharm (Holdings) plc, including the subsidiaries indicated above, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n**_Emerging Growth Company_**\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\n**_Use of Estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\n**_Segment Reporting_**\n\nThe Company operates in one operating segment. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“the CODM”). The Company’s CODM, its Chief Executive Officer, views the Company’s operations and manages its business as a single operating segment, which is the business of a clinical stage immunotherapy Group pioneering commercialization of allogeneic, ‘off-the-shelf’ gamma-delta T cell (‘GD-T’) therapies.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**_Income and Other Taxes_**\n\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 740, _Income Taxes_ (“ASC 740”), which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent they believe these assets will more-likely-than-not be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\n\n**_Income Tax Credit_**\n\nThe Company carries out extensive research and development activities, where it benefits from the United Kingdom’s research and development tax relief and expenditure credit regimes. The Company is able to surrender some of its income tax losses for a cash rebate of up to 20% of expenditures related to eligible research and development projects. Such credits are accounted for, depending on the appropriate tax relief, either within the tax provision or other income, in the year in which the expenditures were incurred.\n\n**_Cash and cash equivalents_**\n\nThe Company defines cash and cash equivalents as cash on hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents was £1.0 million and £2.5 million, respectively.\n\n**_Concentration of Risk_**\n\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains substantially all of its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not incurred any losses associated with this concentration of deposits.\n\nThe Company currently has bank deposits with financial institutions in the U.S. of approximately £0.2 million as of March 31, 2024 which are below the FDIC insurance limits. FDIC insurance provides protection for bank deposits up to $250,000. The Company had approximately £0.8 million in uninsured bank deposits with financial institutions outside the U.S as of March 31, 2024. All uninsured bank deposits are held at high quality credit institutions.\n\n**_Foreign currency transactions_**\n\nThe Company uses the British pound sterling as the reporting currency for its financial statements. Functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries are the local currencies. The Company has transactions denominated in various currencies, with the principal currency exposure being fluctuations in U.S. Dollars and Euros against pound sterling. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the limited number of supplier agreements denominated in currencies other than pound sterling.\n\n**_Property and Equipment_**\n\nProperty and equipment consist of computer equipment, facility, and scientific equipment and office equipment, which are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, and depreciated over their estimated lives using the straight-line method.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \nDepreciation is provided for by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES\n\nProperty and Equipment | Estimated Useful Life  \n---|---  \nScientific equipment | 4-10 years  \nComputer equipment | 3 years  \nOffice equipment | 5 years  \n  \nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When assets have been retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations.\n\n**_Intangible assets_**\n\nIntangible assets consist of software, patents and licenses. Intangible assets are recognized where it is probable that there will be a future economic benefit and that this can be reliably measured. Software represents the historical cost of installation of third-party software used within the Company to maintain and control the Company’s quality system. The software is hosted and controlled on the Company’s servers and can be used independently of the related hardware. Software is amortized, on a straight-line basis, over the life of the relevant license of three to four years. Patent costs represent the costs of securing patents in relation to the Company’s intellectual property. Patent costs are amortized, on a straight-line basis, over the remaining legal life of the relevant patents, which has an average estimated patent life of 16 years. License costs represent costs incurred for securing use of third-party technology. License costs are amortized, on a straight-line basis, over the life of the relevant license of three years. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as appropriate.\n\nThe Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets where there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets in which case the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in the statement of operations. There was no impairment of tangible or intangible assets during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**_Fair Value Measurements_**\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, _Fair Value Measurement_ , which primarily includes cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued expenses, which approximate the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets due to the liquid nature. The Company also has certain liability classified warrants that are being remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period and are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, the balance of the liability classified warrants was not material as of either March 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023 (see Note 12).\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**_Net Loss per Share_**\n\nBasic net loss per share ordinary share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding in accordance with ASC Topic 260, _Earnings per Share_. Diluted net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares. When the Company reports a net loss, the calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential ordinary shares as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Potential ordinary shares are composed of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants. The following table shows the basic and diluted loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\nSCHEDULE OF BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE\n\nFor the Three Months Ended | For the Three Months Ended  \n---|---  \nMarch 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023  \nNet loss | £| (3,321,854| ) | £| (634,911| )  \nBasic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding | 30,138,602 | 2,051,836  \nBasic and diluted loss per share | £| (0.11| ) | £| (0.31| )  \n  \n**_Share-Based Compensation_**\n\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements with employees, directors, and consultants and recognizes the compensation expense for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. Compensation expense for all share-based awards is based on the estimated grant-date fair value and recognized in earnings over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period).\n\n**_Research & Development Expenses_**\n\nResearch expenditure is expensed in the year in which it is incurred. Identifiable development expenditure is capitalized to the extent that the technical, commercial and financial feasibility can be demonstrated. The Company has not capitalized any development expenditures since inception.\n\n**_Commitments and Contingencies_**\n\nThe Company accounts for contingencies in accordance with ASC 450-20, _Contingencies._ Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\n\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Further details are included within Note 7 to the financial statements.\n\n**_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_**\n\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements. Further, during December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09-Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires entities to provide additional information in the rate reconciliation and additional disclosures about income taxes paid. The guidance should be applied prospectively and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not expect the issued standard to have a material impact on its financial statements or results of operations.\n\n**NOTE 3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nThe Company’s property, plant and equipment balances consist of the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT BALANCES\n\nFacilities & Scientific Equipment | Computer Equipment | Office Equipment | Total  \n---|---|---|---  \nAt December 31, 2023 | £| 4,979,026 | £| 366,823 | £| 86,331 | £| 5,432,180  \nAdditions | - | - | - | -  \nDisposals | - | - | - | -  \nAt March 31, 2024 | 4,979,026 | 366,823 | 86,331 | 5,432,180  \nDepreciation  \nAt December 31, 2023 | 3,731,217 | 341,763 | 84,402 | 4,157,382  \nDepreciation expense | 110,595 | 3,620 | 530 | 114,745  \nAt March 31, 2024 | 3,841,812 | 345,383 | 84,932 | 4,272,127  \nNet book value  \nAt March 31, 2024 | £| 1,137,214 | £| 21,440 | £| 1,399 | £| 1,160,053  \nAt December 31, 2023 | £| 1,247,809 | £| 25,060 | £| 1,929 | £| 1,274,798  \n  \nDepreciation expense on these assets for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023, was £114,745 and £169,155, respectively, and is included in research and development and administrative expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 4. INTANGIBLE ASSETS**\n\nThe Company’s intangible assets consist of the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nSoftware | Patents and Licenses | Total  \n---|---|---  \nCost  \nAt December 31, 2023 | 49,613 | 810,993 | 860,606  \nIntangible assets, Beginning | 49,613 | 810,993 | 860,606  \nAdditions | - | 5,618 | 5,618  \nAt March 31, 2024 | 49,613 | 816,611 | 866,224  \nIntangible assets, Ending | 49,613 | 816,611 | 866,224  \nAmortization  \nAt December 31, 2023 | 49,613 | 195,823 | 245,436  \nAmortization expense | - | 12,276 | 12,276  \nAt March 31, 2024 | 49,613 | 208,099 | 257,712  \nNet book value  \nAt March 31, 2024 | £| - | £| 608,512 | £| 608,512  \nAt December 31, 2023 | £| - | £| 615,170 | £| 615,170  \n  \nAmortization expense on these assets for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, was £12,276 and £11,815, respectively, and is included in research and development expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n**NOTE 5. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS **\n\nThe Company’s prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nOther receivables | £| 51,826 | £| 51,584  \nVAT owed to the Company | 66,957 | 135,642  \nPrepaid clinical trial costs | 307,519 | 307,519  \nDeferred clinical trial testing costs | 1,177,500 | 1,177,500  \nOther prepayments | 463,688 | 522,480  \nTotal | £| 2,067,490 | £| 2,194,725  \n  \nThe fair value of trade and other receivables are not materially different to the book value.\n\n**NOTE 6. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES**\n\nThe Company’s accounts payable and accrued liabilities consist of the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES \n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nAccounts payable | £| 1,927,612 | £| 1,847,279  \nOther tax and social security | 290,255 | 139,029  \nAccrued expenses | 1,013,162 | 1,229,419  \nAmounts accrued in respect to clinical trial testing | 1,177,500 | 1,177,500  \nOther payables | 44,918 | 38,613  \nTotal | £| 4,453,447 | £| 4,431,840  \n  \nThe fair value of accounts payable and accrued expenses are not materially different to the book value.\n\n**NOTE 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES **\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \nIn accordance with the terms of a Convertible Loan Note (‘Note’) on August 9, 2022 (the Conversion Date) the Company issued 183,820 Ordinary Shares and 367,640 listed warrants to the Note holder in full satisfaction of the Note in the aggregate amount of $781,233. The holder filed a claim in the English courts on June 19, 2023 asserting that notice was provided such that the Company should have paid it the value of the Note in cash, rather than by settling it through the issuance of Ordinary Shares and listed warrants. The holder is demanding payment of the face value of the Note, together with interest, (approximately $860,000 as at the time of the initial filing of the claim). The litigation process is in its early stages and is not expected to conclude until late 2024 or later. The Company has retained English solicitors and is contesting the claim in its entirety. The Company believes that it acted correctly under the terms of the Note and has accounted for the transaction on that basis, and that no further amounts are payable to the holder.\n\n**NOTE 8. LEASES**\n\nThe Company leases certain office space under operating leases for use in operations. The Company recognizes operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Management determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single component for all leases. Operating lease right to use (ROU) assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future lease payments over the expected lease term, which includes optional renewal periods if we determine it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, the discount rate used in the present value calculation represents our incremental borrowing rate determined using information available at the commencement date. Operating lease expense is included as a component of research and development and administrative expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded operating lease expense of £86,785 and £86,291, respectively. Cash payments on lease liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 totaled £111,754 and £111,754, respectively. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate were as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING LEASE TERM AND DISCOUNT RATE\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nWeighted-average remaining lease term | 4.91 years | 5.11 years  \nWeighted-average discount rate | 8.6| % | 8.6| %  \n  \nThe following is a maturity analysis of the annual undiscounted cash flows reconciled to the carrying value of the operating lease liabilities as of March 31, 2024:\n\nSCHEDULE OF OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES\n\nYears Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2024 | £| 335,261  \n2025 | 447,015  \n2026 | 447,015  \n2027 | 447,015  \n2028 | 447,015  \nLess imputed interest | (395,194| )  \nTotal | £| 1,728,127  \n  \n**NOTE 9. CONVERTIBLE LOAN**\n\nThe Company entered into a $20 million convertible loan note instrument in April 2021. The note has a 5% annual interest rate. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company converted loan notes totaling $809,692 and $14,228,245, respectively, into ordinary shares and warrants and repaid $0 and $3,195,765, respectively, of the convertible loan note. The convertible loan was recognized as a hybrid financial instrument and accounted for as two separate components: (i) a loan and (ii) an embedded conversion option derivative. As of December 31 2023, the convertible loan had either been fully paid down or converted. As such, the balance of both the convertible loan and corresponding embedded derivative was $0 as of December 31, 2023.\n\n(i) The convertible loan’s initial fair value was the residual amount of the consideration received, net of attributable costs, after separating out the fair value of the embedded conversion option derivative. The loan was subsequently measured at its amortized cost.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n(ii) The embedded conversion option derivative was initially measured at fair value and was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The embedded derivative could have been classified as a component of equity only if in all cases the contract would be settled by the Company delivering a fixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or debt redemption. That is, had the embedded instrument satisfied the “fixed-for-fixed” criteria outlined in ASC 815-40. However, the convertible accounting outlined in ASC 815-40). Changes in the fair value (gains or losses) of the derivative at the end of instrument included a conversion feature resulting in settlement in a variable number of shares and consequently, was not considered indexed to the company’s shares (i.e. it did not qualify for the scope exception to derivative each period were recorded in the consolidated statements of operations) for the year ended December 31, 2023:\n\nSCHEDULE OF CHANGES IN CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENT\n\nResidual loan | Embedded Derivative | Total  \n---|---|---  \nBalance at December 31, 2022 | £| 653,484 | £| 2,439 | £| 655,923  \nAccrued interest | 71,568 | - | 71,568  \nRepayment | (639,336| ) | (2,439| ) | (641,775| )  \nModification of loan notes | (53,619| ) | - | (53,619| )  \nCurrency adjustment | (32,097| ) | - | (32,097| )  \nBalance at December 31, 2023 | £| - | £| - | £| -  \n  \nThe value of the embedded derivative was remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, based on the Black-Scholes valuation model, with recognition of the changes in fair value in the consolidated statements of operations. As noted above, the value of the embedded derivative liability as of December 31, 2023 was $0.\n\n**NOTE 10. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY **\n\n**_Ordinary shares_**\n\nThe Ordinary shares have no specific rights, preferences or restrictions attached to them.\n\n**_Deferred shares_**\n\nDeferred shares have the following properties:\n\na. | do not entitle their holders to receive any dividend or other distribution;  \n---|---  \nb. | do not entitle their holders to receive a share certificate in respect of the relevant shareholding;  \nc. | do not entitle their holders to receive notice of, nor to attend, speak or vote at, any general meeting of the Company;  \n  \n17  \n---  \n  \nd. | entitles their holders on a return of capital on a winding up of the Company (but not otherwise) only to the repayment of the amount paid up on that share after payment of the capital paid up on each Ordinary Share in the share capital of the Company and the further payment of £100,000,000 on each ordinary share;  \n---|---  \ne. | do not entitle their holders to any further participation in the capital, profits or assets of the Company. The Deferred Shares shall not be capable of transfer at any time other than with the prior written consent of the directors of the Company.  \n  \n**_A Ordinary shares_**\n\nThe A Ordinary shares ranked equally with all other shares in issue in that on a vote every member has one vote for each share held. The A ordinary shares contain preferential economic rights such that, in the event of a share or asset sale (as defined in the Articles of Association), they provide a return to the holders of the A Ordinary Shares of an amount greater than or equal to 1.5x the price paid by the investors for A Ordinary Shares. The A Ordinary shares have an anti-dilution provision where shares are subsequently issued at a price below £215.00 per share, whereby the existing A Ordinary shareholders receive additional compensation shares in line with the formula set out in the Articles of Association. The A Ordinary shares rank equally with all other shares in issue with respect to dividends.\n\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO, 493,860 ordinary shares were issued, under the terms of the Articles of Association to certain shareholders who, prior to the IPO, owned A Ordinary shares which carried the right, to subscribe at nominal value for a certain number of additional shares, calculated by reference to the pre-money valuation of the IPO. As part of the IPO share issue, the Company re-organized its share capital whereby all of the outstanding series A ordinary shares were re-designated as ordinary shares of the Company on a one for one basis and as such no anti-dilution provisions are included within the issued shares.\n\n**_Reorganization and IPO_**\n\nImmediately prior to completion of the IPO, the Company re-organized its share capital whereby all of the outstanding series A ordinary shares were re-designated as ordinary shares of TC BioPharm (Holdings) plc on a one for one basis. Immediately prior to the completion of the offering, a further 493,860 ordinary shares were issued, under the terms of the Articles of Association to certain shareholders who, prior to the IPO, owned A ordinary shares which carried the right, to subscribe at nominal value for a certain number of additional shares, calculated by reference to the pre-money valuation of the IPO. The fair value of the shares issued was £3.8 million.\n\n**_Share Issuances_**\n\nDuring January of 2023, the Company issued 65,750 or 1,315,000 ordinary shares, par value £0.0001 per share of Company, based on a price per share of £0.0001 on exercise of pre-funded warrants that had been issued in prior financing rounds. As the pre-funded warrants contained a nominal exercise price, the exercise of the pre-funded warrants resulted in nominal proceeds to the Company.\n\nOn March 27, 2023, the Company, entered into a Second Securities Purchase Agreement with Investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 10,750 ADSs, or 215,000 ordinary shares, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 161,125 ADSs, and Series C purchase warrants to purchase up to 171,875 ADSs Securities. In addition, the Company also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 12,891 ADSs. The purchase price for each ADS and associated Ordinary Warrants was $32 (on a post-split basis) and the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Ordinary Warrants was $31.98 (on a post-split basis). The Ordinary Warrants were immediately exercisable, expire five (5) years from the date of issuance and the Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. The total net proceeds from this offering were approximately £4.0 million (or $4.9 million), after deducting estimated offering expenses of approximately £0.5 million.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \nOn March 27, 2023, the Company also agreed that certain existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 140,000 ADSs of the Company that were previously issued on November 30, 2022, at an exercise price of $100 (on a post-split basis) per ADS and expiration dates of May 30, 2025 and May 30, 2028, were amended effective upon the closing of the Offering so that the amended warrants will have a reduced exercise price of $35 (on a post-split basis) per ADS. To account for the modification, the Company recognized the increase in fair value of the modified warrants (measured as the difference between the fair value immediately before and after the modification) a as a charge against the gross proceeds of the offering.\n\nDuring January of 2024, the Company issued 1,398,000 or 27,960,000 ordinary shares, par value £0.0001 per share of Company, based on a price per share of £0.0001 on exercise of pre-funded warrants that had been issued in prior financing rounds. As the pre-funded warrants contained a nominal exercise price, the exercise of the pre-funded warrants resulted in nominal proceeds to the Company. \n\nOn March 11, 2024, the company issued 121,070 ADSs or 2,421,400 ordinary shares, par value £0.0001 per share of Company, based on a price per share of £0.0001 on exercise of share options that had been issued to a consultant as part of the consideration for undertaking consulting services. The issued shares options were recognized as non-employee compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718. Further, the fair value of the shares (as determined utilizing the Black Scholes valuation model) will be recognized over the estimated one-year consulting service period. Approximately £6,356 was recognized during the three month period ended March 31, 2024.\n\nOn March 11, 2024, the Company issued 23,808 ADSs or 476,153 ordinary shares, par value £0.0001 per share of Company to Bryan Kobel, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company following an agreement to convert an aggregate amount of approximately £19,765 (or approximately $24,760) of accrued but unpaid contractual pension benefits owed to him. The issued ADSs were based on a price per ADS equal to the closing price of the Company’s ADSs on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 7, 2024.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nOn March 12, 2024, the Company issued 623,750 ADSs representing 12,475,000 ordinary shares of the Company upon exercise of outstanding Series D  warrants resulting in gross cash proceeds to the Company of £986,772 (approximately $1,263,000), which included £73,980 of offering costs.\n\n**_ADS Ratio Change_**\n\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company changed its ratio of ADSs ordinary shares from one ADS representing one ordinary share to one ADS representing 20 ordinary shares. As a result of the ratio change, all references in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to units of ordinary shares underlying ADSs are reflective of the ratio change for all periods presented. In addition, the exercise prices and the numbers of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of any outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares were proportionally adjusted pursuant to the respective anti-dilution terms of the share-based payment plans.\n\n**NOTE 11. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION**\n\n**_Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) share option scheme_**\n\nThe Company operates an HMRC Approved Enterprise Management Incentive (“EMI”) share option scheme for employees. Effective December 16, 2014, the Company approved a share option scheme under which the Board of Directors of the Company can award options to directors, officers, employees and consulting personnel of the Company. The Board of Directors will determine the terms, limitations, restrictions and conditions of the options granted under the plan.\n\nThe Company has granted options over ADSs to certain employees.\n\nSCHEDULE OF GRANTED OPTIONS\n\nNumber of Share Options | Weighted Average Exercise Price  \n---|---  \nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 | 5,328 | £| 460  \nGranted during the period | - | -  \nExercised during the period | - | -  \nForfeited during the period | - | -  \nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 | 5,328 | £| 460  \nExerciseable at March 31, 2024 | 5,328 | £| 460  \nUnexerciseable at March 31, 2024 | - | -  \n  \n20  \n---  \n  \nThe estimated fair value of the options outstanding in the period was calculated by applying a Monte Carlo Simulation for those options issued in 2020 and 2019 and a Black Scholes Model for those options issued in prior periods. The most appropriate approach is selected with reference to the share capital structure at the time of grant. The expense recognized for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was £0 as all options were fully vested as of March 31, 2024.\n\n**_2021 Share Option Scheme_**\n\nEffective immediately prior to completion of the IPO on February 10, 2022, the Company adopted a new share option scheme, or the 2021 Share Option Scheme, for the purpose granting share options to incentivize the Company’s directors, employees and consultants. The 2021 Share Option Scheme incorporates a sub-plan for option holders subject to taxation in the United States, or the 2021 U.S. Sub-Plan, to provide for the grant of U.S. qualified incentive options.\n\nThe Company has granted options over ADSs to certain employees and directors.\n\n* | Number of Share Options | Weighted Average Exercise Price  \n---|---|---  \nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 | 37,066 | $| 230  \nGranted during the period | 999,838 | 1.07  \nExercised during the period | (121,070| ) | .0025  \nCancelled during the period | (933| ) | 4,240  \nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 | 914,901 | $| 6.01  \nExerciseable at March 31, 2024 | 914,901 | $| 6.01  \nUnexerciseable at March 31, 2024 | - | -  \n  \nThe totals of options and related exercise price are for options over ADSs and reflect the ratio change on December 15, 2023.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the options outstanding in the period was calculated by applying a Black Scholes Model. The most appropriate approach is selected with reference to the share capital structure at the time of grant. The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during the three month period ended March 31, 2024 was $0.93. No options were granted during the threemonth period ended March 31, 2023. The expense recognized for share-based payments in respect of employee and non-employee services received during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was £784,555.\n\nThe options granted under the 2021 share option scheme will typically vest over three years after the date of grant. In some cases, options granted to senior management vested immediately. As of March 31, 2024, there were no remaining unvested options.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \n**_Modifications_**\n\nDuring March of 2024, share options that had been granted to five grantees, including one of our executive officers and all of our non-employee directors, were cancelled and replaced by new options with different terms. The company determined that the option cancellations and subsequent re-issuances should be considered award modifications and be recognized in accordance with the guidance in ASC 718-20. As the new awards vested immediately, the Company fully recognized the incremental fair value of the awards of £248,659.\n\n**_Additional Right to Subscribe for Shares_**\n\nOn August 25, 2020, the Company issued Ordinary shares, which included an additional right to subscribe for a fixed number (15,891) of shares at £215.00 per share at a future date based on certain clinical and commercial milestones. The estimated fair value of the right to subscribe was calculated by applying a Black Scholes Model. This was deemed the most appropriate approach due to the future liquidity event being date-uncertain and could take one of many forms.\n\n**NOTE 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS **\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\n\nLevel 1: | Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  \n---|---  \nLevel 2: | Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.  \nLevel 3: | Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  \n  \nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of £1.0 million as of March 31, 2024. The cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value due to the liquid nature of the instruments and are measured in Level 1.\n\nIn addition, the Company also had numerous outstanding warrants that were classified in Level 2 due to our use of implied volatility in determining the expected volatility input for purposes of determining the instruments fair value via the Black-Scholes valuation model. The details of the issued warrants were as follows:\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n_Unlisted warrants in issue_\n\n_Series A warrants_\n\nThe fair value of each of the warrants was approximately $0.06 and $0.37 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nThe inputs associated with calculating the fair value of the warrants are considered to be Level 2 and were valued using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The inputs were as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED ON RECURRING AND NON RECURRING BASIS\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nExercise price | $| 100.00 | $| 100.00  \nShare price | $| 1.31 | $| 3.17  \nTime to maturity | 4.17 years | 4.4 years  \nExpected volatility | 90| % | 90| %  \nRisk free interest rate (US treasury bond) | 3.9| % | 4.0| %  \nDividend yield | - | -  \n  \n_Series B warrants_\n\nThe fair value of each of the warrants was approximately $0.00 and $0.02 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nThe inputs associated with calculating the fair value of the warrants are considered to be Level 2 and were valued using a Black-Scholes valuation model.

The inputs were as follows:\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nExercise price | $| 125.00 | $| 125.00  \nShare price | $| 1.31 | $| 3.17  \nTime to maturity | 4.17 years | 4.4 years  \nExpected volatility | 90| % | 90| %  \nRisk free interest rate (US treasury bond) | 3.9| % | 4.0| %  \n- | -  \n  \n_Series C placement agent warrants_\n\nThe fair value of each of the warrants was $0.12 and $0.69 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nThe inputs associated with calculating the fair value of the warrants are considered to be Level 2 and were valued using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The inputs were as follows:\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nExercise price | $| 40.00 | $| 40.00  \nShare price | $| 1.31 | $| 3.17  \nTime to maturity | 3.99 years | 4.2 years  \nExpected volatility | 90| % | 90| %  \nRisk free interest rate (US treasury bond) | 4.5| % | 4.0| %  \nDividend yield | - | -  \n  \n_Series D warrants_\n\nThe fair value of each of the warrants was $8.46 as of the August 30, 2023 issuance date. As the warrants were equity classified, they were not re-measured to fair value as of December 31, 2023. The warrants were subsequently exercised in full on March 12, 2024.\n\n**NOTE 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nManagement evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date, up to the date that the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, other than as set forth below, management did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\nOn May 6, 2024, the Company, entered into a letter agreement (the “Inducement Letter”) with certain holders (the “Holders”) of existing Series E warrants (the “Existing Warrants”) to purchase ordinary shares represented by american depositary shares (the “ADSs”) of the Company. The Existing Warrants were issued on December 21, 2023 and have an exercise price of £1.5814 per ADS. Each ADS represents twenty (20) ordinary shares of the Company.\n\nPursuant to the Inducement Letter, the Holders agreed to exercise for cash their Existing Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,750,000 ADSs of the Company for cash and the payment of £0.099625 (US$0.125) per new warrant in consideration for the Company’s agreement to issue new Series F warrants to purchase ordinary shares represented by ADSs (the “New Warrants”), as described below, to purchase up to 70,000,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares represented by 3,500,000 ADSs (the “New Warrant ADSs”). The Company expects to receive aggregate gross proceeds of approximately £3.1 million from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Holders, prior to deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses.\n\nThe Company engaged H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (the “Placement Agent”) to act as its exclusive placement agent in connection with the transactions summarized above and has agreed to pay the Placement Agent a cash fee equal to 7.5% of the gross proceeds received from the Holders’ exercise of their Existing Warrants and a management fee of 1% of the gross proceeds received from the Holders’ exercise of their Existing Warrants. The Company has also agreed to reimburse the Placement Agent for its expenses in connection with the exercise of the Existing Warrants and the issuance of the New Warrants, up to $50,000 for fees and expenses of legal counsel and other out-of-pocket expenses, and agreed to pay the Placement Agent for non-accountable expenses in the amount of $35,000 and a clearing fee of $15,950. Upon any exercise for cash of any New Warrants, the Company has agreed to pay the Placement Agent a cash fee of 7.5% of the aggregate gross exercise price paid in cash with respect the exercise of the New Warrants. In addition, the Company granted warrants (“Placement Agent Warrants”) to the Placement Agent, or its designees, to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,625,020 ordinary shares represented by 131,251 ADSs, which Placement Agent Warrants shall be substantially in the same form as the New Warrants except that the Placement Agent Warrants will have an exercise price of £2.2313.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**Item 2.** | **Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**  \n---|---  \n  \n_The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our audited financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. This discussion and analysis and other parts of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and projections. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. You should carefully read the “Risk Factors” section of this Quarterly Report and of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Please also see the section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_\n\n**Overview**\n\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a cell-based product pipeline capable of treating a variety of disorders including cancer and infectious disease. We are currently developing a pipeline of unmodified allogeneic GD-T therapies and next generation GD CAR-T treatments with a number of advantages over conventional approaches. We own our main patent families in the GD CAR-T space, providing robust IP protection and manufactures all products in-house, leading to a much lower cost of goods than competitor products.\n\nIn-house clinical studies have demonstrated that our unmodified allogeneic GD-T products are (i) well tolerated and (ii) show preliminary evidence of disease modification in patients with the late-stage blood cancer, known as acute myeloid leukemia – AML. Based on clinical data generated by us, we believe that unmodified GD-Ts have the potential to treat all blood cancers.\n\nThe Company’s lead product, TCB-008, is now in phase 2b-into-pivotal (phase 3) clinical studies with a view to launching its first oncology product for the treatment of AML. Clinical results generated thus far have enabled us to obtain FDA orphan drug status for treatment of AML.\n\nIn addition to unmodified allogenic GD-Ts for treatment of blood cancers, we are also developing an expanded platform for TCB-008 use case in anti-fungal, anti-viral and anti-microbial diseases. We believe TCB-008 can be impactful in immune-suppressed and immune-compromised patient populations, including cancer patients, to treat and act as a prophylactic in these disease verticals.\n\nIn order to manufacture our portfolio of allogeneic products, we select the highest quality GD-T cells from healthy donors, activate the cells and grow them in large numbers at our in-house GMP-compliant manufacturing facility before administration to a patient in order to target and then destroy malignant or virally-infected tissues. We believe that we have introduced a step-change to our manufacturing platform by implementing a freeze-thaw process that will allow product to be shipped from cleanroom to patient without any shelf-life issue. Resulting products, we believe, will be more cost-effective and straightforward to ship from cleanroom to clinic. Our team continues to improve and optimize our process based on data and new technologies being developed globally.\n\n**Components of Our Results of Operations**\n\n**_Revenues_**\n\nWe do not have any approved products. Accordingly, we have not generated any revenue from the sale of products, and we do not expect to generate any such revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approvals for, and commercialize any of, our product candidates. In the future, we will seek to generate revenue primarily from product sales and, potentially, regional or global collaborations with strategic partners, which may produce license fee income.\n\nSince inception through March 31, 2024, the Company has received £14.5 million in pre-clinical payments connected with CAR-T development partnerships. These partnerships are no longer actively being progressed and it is unlikely that we will receive any future milestone revenues.\n\n**_Operating Expenses_**\n\nWe classify our operating expenses into two categories: research and development expenses and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based payment expense, comprise a significant component of each of these expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with personnel costs based on the function performed by the respective employees.\n\n**_Research and Development Expenses_**\n\nThe largest component of our total operating expenses since inception has been costs related to our research and development activities, including the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates.\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred, with our development activities not yet at the point at which capitalization can occur under GAAP. Our research and development expense primarily consist of:\n\n● | consumable costs related to research and development of pharmaceutical or biologic therapy products for preclinical studies and clinical trials;  \n---|---  \n● | costs related to manufacturing active pharmaceutical or biologic therapy products for preclinical studies and clinical trials;  \n● | salaries and personnel-related costs, including bonuses, benefits and any share-based payment expense, for our personnel performing research and development activities or managing those activities that have been out-sourced;  \n● | fees paid to consultants and other third parties who support our product candidate development;  \n  \n25  \n---  \n  \n● | third party costs incurred in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials from investigative sites and contract research organizations, or CROs;  \n---|---  \n● | other costs incurred in seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates;  \n● | costs of related office space allocated to our research and development function, materials and equipment; and  \n● | payments under our license agreements.  \n  \nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. In addition, the cost of development of our CAR-T range of products is likely to be substantially higher than costs incurred historically in the development of our unmodified products. Accordingly, we expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our product candidates to offset these expenses. Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.\n\nThe duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors including:\n\n● | the scope, rate of progress, results and expenses of our ongoing and future clinical trials, preclinical studies and research and development activities;  \n---|---  \n● | the potential need for additional clinical trials or preclinical studies requested by regulatory agencies;  \n● | potential uncertainties in clinical trial enrolment rates or drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;  \n● | competition with other drug development companies in, and the related expense of, identifying and enrolling patients in our clinical trials and contracting with third-party manufacturers for the production of the drug product needed for our clinical trials;  \n● | the achievement of milestones requiring payments under in-licensing agreements;  \n● | any significant changes in government regulation;  \n● | the terms and timing of any regulatory approvals;  \n● | the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and  \n● | the ease, cost and ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates, if approved.  \n  \nWe track research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis for both clinical-stage and preclinical product candidates. Manufacturing, clinical trial and preclinical research and development expenses are assigned or allocated to individual product candidates. We do not allocate employee costs or facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to oversee research and development as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**_Administrative Expenses_**\n\nAdministrative expenses consist of personnel costs, other administrative expenses and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense. Other administrative expenses include office space-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees and costs of our information systems. We anticipate that our administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We expect to continue to incur additional expenses as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, additional insurance expenses, and expenses related to investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.\n\n**_Change in fair value of derivative liability_**\n\nThe gain/loss relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative related to the issue of Convertible Loan Notes, calculated by using a Black Scholes option pricing model at the end of each reporting period. The gain/loss relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of our warrants, calculated by using a Black Scholes option pricing model at the end of each reporting period. As it pertains to the issued warrants, it is important to note that as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 they were primarily equity classified and therefore are no longer required to be re-measured to fair value at the end of each reporting period.\n\n**_Interest Expense_**\n\nInterest expense includes the effective interest charge accrued in relation to the Convertible Loan Notes. Interest expense is offset by interest income related to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits.\n\n**_Income Tax Credit_**\n\nWe are subject to corporate taxation in the United Kingdom. Due to the nature of our business, we have generated losses since inception. Our income tax credit recognized represents the sum of the research and development tax credits recoverable in the United Kingdom.\n\nAs a company that carries out extensive research and development activities, we benefit from the United Kingdom research and development tax credit regime and are able to surrender some of our losses for a cash rebate of up to 20% of expenditures related to eligible research and development projects. Qualifying expenditures largely comprise clinical trial and manufacturing costs, employment costs for relevant staff and consumables incurred as part of research and development projects. A large portion of costs relating to our research and development, clinical trials and manufacturing activities are eligible for inclusion within these tax credit cash rebate claims.\n\nThere can be no certainty that we will be able to continue to claim research and development tax credits in the future. Tax losses that have not been utilized to offset taxable income or surrendered in connection with the aforementioned research and development tax credits are carried forward to be offset against future taxable profits. In the event we generate revenues in the future, we may benefit from the United Kingdom’s government’s “patent box” initiative that allows profits attributable to revenues from patents and/or patented products registered in the United Kingdom or European Union to be taxed at a lower rate than other streams of revenue. The current rate of tax for relevant streams of revenue for companies receiving this relief is 10%.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n**Results of Operations**\n\n**_Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023_**\n\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations:\n\n**For the Three** **Months Ended** **March 31, 2024** | **For the Three** **Months Ended** **March 31, 2023** | £ Change | % Change  \n---|---|---|---  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development expenses | 1,298,942 | 1,934,304 | (635,362| ) | (32.8| )%  \nAdministrative expenses | 2,142,714 | 2,231,461 | (88,747| ) | (4.0| )%  \nTotal operating expenses | 3,441,656 | 4,165,765 | (724,109| ) | (17.4| )%  \nLoss from operations | (3,441,656| ) | (4,165,765| ) | 724,109 | (17.4| )%  \nOther income (expense):  \nChange in fair value of derivatives | 11,446 | 3,148,648 | (3,137,202| ) | (99.6| )%  \nOther expense, net | (2,386| ) | (17,794| ) | 15,408 | (86.6| )%  \nTotal other income (expense), net | 9,060 | 3,130,854 | (3,121,794| ) | (99.7| )%  \nNet loss before income taxes | (3,432,596| ) | (1,034,911| ) | (2,397,685| ) | 231.7| %  \nIncome tax credit | 110,742 | 400,000 | (289,258| ) | (72.3| )%  \nNet loss | £| (3,321,854| ) | £| (634,911| ) | £| (2,686,943| ) | 423.2| %  \n  \n**_Research and Development Expenses_**\n\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \n£’000’s | £’000’s | £ Change | % Change  \nDirect research and development expenses by program:  \nUnmodified cell therapy programs(1) | £| 316 | £| 446 | £| (130| ) | (29.2| )%  \nOther research and development programs(2) | 21 | 188 | (167| ) | (88.9| )%  \nTotal direct research and development expense | 337 | 634 | (298| ) | (46.9| )%  \nResearch and development and unallocated costs:  \nPersonnel related (including share-based compensation) | 620 | 896 | (277| ) | (30.9| )%  \nIndirect research and development expense(3) | 343 | 404 | (61| ) | (15.1| )%  \nTotal research and development expenses | £| 1,299 | £| 1,934 | £| (635| ) | (32.8| )%  \n(1) | Unmodified cell therapy programs include OmnImmune® and ImmuniStim®  \n---|---  \n(2) | Other research and development programs include expenditure on areas such as our CAR-T program and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).  \n(3) | Indirect research and development expense includes property related costs and depreciation and amortization.  \n  \nResearch and development expenses decreased by 33% to £1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from £1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, which was primarily driven by a decrease in direct and indirect research expenses due to a refocus of the clinical strategy and consequently a decrease in personnel.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \n**_General and administrative_**\n\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023 | £ Change | % Change  \n£’000’s | £’000’s  \nShare-based compensation expense | 785 | 100 | £| 685 | 686.9| )%  \nEmployee-related costs | 464 | 688 | (224| ) | (32.6| )%  \nLegal & professional fees | 827 | 1,345 | (517| ) | (38.5| )%  \nOther expenses | 67 | 99 | (32| ) | (32.5| )%  \nTotal administrative expenses | 2,143 | 2,231 | (89| ) | (4.0| )%  \n  \nAdministrative expenses decreased by 4% to £2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from £2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in employee-related costs and a decrease in legal and professional fees, offset by an increase in share-based compensation expense.\n\n**_Change in fair value of derivative liability_**\n\nThe change in fair value of derivative liability is comprised of the change in fair values of the convertible loan derivative, warrant derivative, and other derivatives. The change in the fair value of the embedded convertible loan derivatives relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nThe change in fair value of the warrant derivatives for the three months ended March 31, 2024 relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of our issued detachable warrants. The warrants were issued at the time of the IPO and at various times during each of the two years ended December 31, 2023. In addition, certain warrants were both modified and induced over the course of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. All of our issued warrants are valued by using the Black Scholes option pricing model.\n\n**_Other expense, net_**\n\nOther expense, net is comprised of foreign currency (losses) gains and interest (expense) income. Interest expense decreased by 100% during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was due to the Convertible Loan Note being paid off during 2023. Interest expense was partially offset by interest income earned on cash accounts. The change in foreign currency (losses) increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to a higher foreign exchange rate during 2024.\n\n**_Income tax credit_**\n\nThe research and development tax credit of £0.1 million was 72% lower for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to £0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This was due to lower levels of expenditure eligible for research and development tax credits and changes in the UK tax rules around research and development tax credits.\n\nAfter accounting for tax credits receivable, there were accumulated tax losses for carry forward in the United Kingdom of £18.3 million as of March 31, 2024. Unrecognized deferred tax assets totaling £4.9 million as of March 31, 2024 consist of temporary differences on tax losses and share-based compensation arrangements. No deferred tax asset is recognized in respect of accumulated tax losses or temporary differences on share-based compensation arrangements because future profits are not sufficiently certain.\n\n**_Going Concern_**\n\nOur existing cash of £1.0 million as of March 31, 2024 will not be sufficient to enable us to conduct our business 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements. We will need additional funding to complete the development and research of our products. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development efforts.\n\nOn May 8, 2023, the Group had cash on hand of $4.0 million (£3.2 million), which will not be sufficient to enable the Group to meet the cash requirements required to enable it to conduct its business plan through the going concern period (being to May 15, 2025) (“Going Concern Period”). With existing resources, we expect to be able to fund current operations into July 2024.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \nAs a result of the Company’s recurring losses from operations, and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements, there is uncertainty regarding the Company’s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred net losses of £3.3 million and £0.6 million, respectively. We used £2.4 million of cash in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and used £2.9 million of cash in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of £1.0 million and £2.5 million, respectively. From incorporation through March 31, 2024, we have financed our operations primarily through our IPO, private placements of equity securities, convertible loans, government grants, research and development tax credits, and receipts from partner for collaborative research and development services totaling £83.0 million.\n\nWhile we work towards obtaining regulatory approval to advance any of our GD-T cell therapeutic candidates into pivotal clinical trials or to commercialization, we will incur significant research and development expenses, and also commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution and additional funding would be required. Where appropriate, we will seek to fund our operations through milestone payments under our agreements with collaboration partners and additional equity financings.\n\n**_Cash Flows_**\n\nThe following tables summarize the results of our cash flows for the below respective periods:\n\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nNet cash provided by (used in):  \nOperating activities | £| (2,408,593| ) | £| (2,911,247| )  \nInvesting activities | £| (5,618| ) | £| (145,233| )  \nFinancing activities | £| 932,557 | £| 3,954,238  \nChange in cash | £| (1,481,654| ) | £| 897,758  \n  \n**_Operating Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was £2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was £3.3 million, which was offset by noncash items of £0.9 million, consisting of £0.1 million in depreciation and amortization, £0.8 million in share-based compensation expense, and less than £0.1 million in the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Changes in working capital amounted to less than £0.1 million, which consisted of a decrease in the corporation tax receivable and lease liabilities, offset by an increase in prepaid expenses, operating lease right of use assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was £2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was £0.6 million, which was offset by noncash items of £2.6 million, consisting of £0.2 million in depreciation and amortization, £0.1 million in share-based compensation expense, a £3.1 million change in the fair value of the derivative liability, and £0.2 million in offering costs related to the Series C Placement Agent Warrants. Changes in working capital provided £0.3 million in cash.\n\n**_Investing Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was immaterial for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and £0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These amounts relate primarily to purchases of property and equipment related to our facility and patent filing costs.\n\n30  \n---  \n  \n**_Financing Activities_**\n\nNet cash from financing activities was £0.9 million and £3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, these amounts consisted of net proceeds from sale of own shares and warrants for £1.0 million offset by issuance costs of £0.1 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, these amounts consisted of net proceeds from sale of own shares and warrants for £4.1 million offset by issuance costs of £0.2 million.\n\n**_Funding Requirements_**\n\nWe expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates. Our expenses will increase as we (i) advance our product candidates through phases of clinical development and, potentially, registration, (ii) fund our research and development activities to further expand our GD-T cell technologies and develop future product candidates and follow-on versions of our more advanced product candidates, (iii) fund our manufacturing activities and the expansion of our plant to support our ongoing and future clinical trials and potential commercial launch; and (iv) fund our general operations.\n\nSince February 10, 2022, we have been a publicly traded company and incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices. We expect to continue to incur substantial legal and financial compliance costs, which may make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\n\nWe will require additional capital to continue to conduct our business and implement our business plans.\n\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amount of our future working capital requirements, which will depend on and are likely to increase significantly as a result of many uncertain factors, including:\n\n● | the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;  \n---|---  \n● | the costs, timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;  \n● | the costs of future sales and marketing activities, including cost of product sales, medical regulatory affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;  \n● | the amount and timing of the receipt of any future revenue from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and become successful in the market;  \n● | the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to progress research and development and clinical trials;  \n● | the costs and timing of hiring new employees to support our future growth;  \n● | the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; and  \n● | the cost of and extent to which we in-license or acquire additional product candidates or technologies.  \n  \nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our future cash needs through equity offerings and debt and a combination thereof, including securities convertible into ordinary shares and through development collaborations with partners. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, our shareholders’ ownership interest will be diluted.\n\n31  \n---  \n  \nIf we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaborations agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\n\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. If we raise funding through borrowings, we may have to enter into onerous covenants which may adversely impact our operations and our ability to obtain further funding.\n\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to raise any further funding, or if further funding is offered, it will be on terms that are acceptable to us and may bring dilution which is unacceptable to our shareholders.\n\nThe source, timing, and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions, and, more specifically, on the progress of our clinical development program. Funding may not be available when needed, at all, or on terms acceptable to us. Lack of necessary funds may require us to, among other things, delay, scale back or eliminate expenses including some or all our planned development, including our clinical trials. While we may need to raise funds in the future, we believe the current cash reserves should be sufficient to fund our operation for the foreseeable future. Because of these factors, we believe that this creates doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n**Contractual Obligations**\n\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2024 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\nPayments due by period  \n---  \nTotal | Less Than 1 Year | –1 - 3 Years | –4 - 5 Years | More Than 5 Years  \nTrade payables | £| 1,927,612 | £| 1,927,612 | £| – | £| – | £| –  \nLease liabilities | 2,123,321 | 335,261 | 894,030 | 894,030 | –  \nPayables related to clinical trial testing | 1,177,500 | 1,177,500 | – | – | –  \nOther payables | 1,348,335 | 1,348,335 | – | – | –  \nTotal commitments | £| 6,576,768 | £| 4,788,708 | £| 894,030 | £| 894,030 | £|  -  \n  \n**_Lease liabilities_**\n\nAmounts shown as lease liabilities and similar reflect minimum payments due for our leases of office, laboratory and manufacturing space. We entered into a lease for our corporate headquarters in April 2014 and, as part of this agreement, exercised an option to lease additional space in January 2017 and March 2019. The overall lease expires in February 2029.\n\n**_Other commitments_**\n\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third parties who support us in the conduct of certain specialist aspects of clinical trials and preclinical research studies and testing. These contracts are generally cancellable by us upon prior notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the preceding table, as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.\n\nWe have not included any contingent payment obligations that we may incur upon achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, as applicable, or royalty payments that we may be required to make under in-licensing agreements which we have or may enter into which could be payable if any of our products generate future sales or license revenue as the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known and are not anticipated in the near term or before we generate significant revenues.\n\n**Critical Accounting Estimates**\n\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \n**Item 3.** | **Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.\n\n**Item 4.** | **Controls and Procedures**  \n---|---  \n  \n**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures**\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to a material weakness in our internal control over accounting for complex financial instruments (including in determining the appropriate valuation basis in areas requiring significant judgement) and in the accounting for our property leases on conversion from IFRS to GAAP. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\n\n**Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the period ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \n**PART II – OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1.** | **Legal Proceedings**  \n---|---  \n  \nFrom time to time, we are involved in various disputes, claims, suits, investigations, and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the resolution of current pending legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Nonetheless, we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, as legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of a Convertible Loan Note (‘Note’) on August 9, 2022 (the Conversion Date) the Company issued 183,820 Ordinary Shares and 367,640 listed warrants to the Note holder in full satisfaction of the Note in the aggregate amount of $781,233. The holder filed a claim in the English courts on June 19, 2023 asserting that notice was provided such that the Company should have paid it the value of the Note in cash, rather than by settling it through the issuance of Ordinary Shares and listed warrants. The holder is demanding payment of the face value of the Note, together with interest, (approximately $860,000 as at the time of the initial filing of the claim). The litigation process is in its early stages and is not expected to conclude until late 2024 or later. The Company has retained English solicitors and is contesting the claim in its entirety. The Company believes that it acted correctly under the terms of the Note and has accounted for the transaction on that basis, and that no further amounts are payable to the holder.\n\n**Item 1A.** | **Risk Factors**  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our risk factors from those included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**Item 2.** | **Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities**\n\nWe did not repurchase any of our equity securities during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Item 3.** | **Defaults Upon Senior Securities**  \n---|---  \n  \nNone.\n\n**Item 4.** | **Mine Safety Disclosures**  \n---|---  \n  \nNone.\n\n**Item 5.** | **Other Information**  \n---|---  \n  \n**10b5-1 Trading Plans**\n\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, no Section 16 director or officer adopted, modified, or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act).\n\nThere were no “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act) adopted, modified or terminated during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 by our directors and Section 16 officers.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \n**Item 6.** | **Exhibits**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe exhibits required by Item 601 of Regulation S-K and Item 15(b) of this Quarterly Report are listed in the Exhibit Index below.

We make such forward-looking statements\npursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical\nfacts contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “will”,\n“should”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential”, “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable\nterminology.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance, and are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding\nthe future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements\nrelate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control.\nTherefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from\nthose indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n● the sufficiency of our existing cash and cash equivalents to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months and our need to raise\nadditional capital;\n● our ability to generate revenue from products;\n● our limited operating history;\n● our ability to maintain proper and effective internal financial controls;\n● our ability to continue to operate as a going concern;\n● changes in laws, government regulations and policies and interpretations thereof;\n● our ability to obtain and maintain protection for our intellectual property;\n● our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel;\n● our ability to manage our rapid growth and organizational change effectively;\n● the possibility of security vulnerabilities, cyberattacks and network disruptions, including breaches of data security and privacy leaks, data loss, and business\ninterruptions;\n● our compliance with data privacy laws and regulations;\n● our ability to develop and maintain our brand cost-effectively; and\n● the other factors set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q and are subject to business and economic risks.

However, as of June 30, 2023, the Company determined that, pursuant to the\ndefinition provided in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, it no longer satisfied the criteria to be considered an FPI. Pursuant to section 6120 of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission’s (“SEC”) financial reporting manual (“FRM”) the Company was permitted to continue to use forms applicable to FPIs for the remainder of its fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. However, starting on January 1, 2024, the Company began using the forms prescribed for domestic registrants. Further, the Company filed a Form 10-K for\nits fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring January of 2023, the Company issued 65,750 or 1,315,000 ordinary shares, par value £0.0001 per share of Company, based on a price per share of £0.0001 on\nexercise of pre-funded warrants that had been issued in prior financing rounds. As the pre-funded warrants contained a nominal exercise price, the exercise of the pre-funded\nwarrants resulted in nominal proceeds to the Company. On March 27, 2023, the Company, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with\nInvestors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 10,750 American Depository Shares (“ADSs”), or 215,000 ordinary shares, pre-funded\nwarrants to purchase up to 161,125 ADS (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), and Series C purchase warrants to purchase up to 171,875 ADSs (the “Ordinary Warrants” and together\nwith the Pre-Funded Warrants and the ADSs, the “Securities”). In addition, the Company also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 12,891 ADSs. The purchase price for\neach ADS and associated Ordinary Warrants was $32 (on a post-split basis) and the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Ordinary Warrants was $31.98.\nThe Ordinary Warrants were immediately exercisable, expire five (5) years from the date of issuance and the Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised at any time until all of the\nPre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. The total net proceeds from this offering were approximately £4.0 million (or approximately $4.9 million), after deducting estimated\noffering expenses of approximately £0.5 million.\nOn March 27, 2023 the Company also agreed that certain existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 140,000 ADSs of the Company that were previously\nissued on November 30, 2022, at an exercise price of $100 (on a post-split basis) per ADS and expiration dates of May 30, 2025 and May 30, 2028, were amended so that the\namended warrants had a reduced exercise price of $35 (on a post-split basis) per ADS.\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company issued 623,750 ADSs representing 12,475,000 ordinary shares of the Company upon exercise of outstanding warrants resulting in\ngross cash proceeds to the Company of £986,772 (approximately $1,263,000).\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is exposed to a variety of risks in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, currency risk, liquidity risk, equity price risk and credit\nrisk. The Company regularly assesses each of these risks to minimize any adverse effects on the business as a result of those factors.\n8\nGoing Concern\nThe Company has been focused on the development of therapeutic products based around its gamma delta T cell platform technology, with the objective of conducting\nclinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy and eventually being granted regulatory approval to market and sell its products since its incorporation. This activity was\nexpected to be in development for several years and has incurred considerable expenditures to date in research and development expenses and in conducting clinical trials.\nSimilar to most development and/or clinical stage biotechnology companies, the Company has not yet generated any revenues from sales of products, but has obtained cash to\nfinance its research, development and clinical trial activities from equity, debt and grant financings and from receipts from partners under collaborative co-development\nagreements. The Company is expected to continue in this clinical development phase for a number of years before any product becomes marketable. The Company therefore\nexpects to continue to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to approximately £1.0 million. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital\ndeficit of £0.6 million. Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was £2.4 million, and the Company expects to incur continued outflow of\ncash for the foreseeable future. Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was £3.3 million.\nSimilar to many clinical development stage biotechnology companies, the Company’s future liquidity needs, and ability to address them, will largely be determined by\nthe availability of capital, both generally and in particular to fund product candidates and key development and regulatory projects. As a pre-revenue biotechnology Company,\noperations have been financed though continuously raising capital, and management expects to continue to raise capital routinely. The Company is currently and continuously\nprogressing various funding options to fill the projected working capital gap, which could be in the form of an equity raise or other forms of financings such as debt funding,\ncollaborations or licensing arrangements. Management believes that the ongoing financing initiatives should provide sufficient capital to finance planned operations through\n2024, and thereafter we would expect to be in a position to raise significantly greater capital as the clinical program progresses. However, there can be no certainty that these\ninitiatives will be successful and, if they are not, management will seek to deploy alternative plans, which could have a potentially significant negative impact on stockholder\nand asset value. Such plans could include all or any of the following: raising additional capital through low priced and/or complex equity and/or debt financings, entering\ntransactions involving sales, joint venturing or licensing of intellectual property, reducing and/or deferring discretionary spending on research and development or clinical\nprograms, restructuring our operating model to take advantage of our manufacturing capability to generate short term revenues or reducing our cash burn rate through reduction\nin planned operating costs.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which assumes the realization of assets and the\nsatisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not established a source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, and as such, has been\ndependent on ongoing funding operations primarily through ongoing initiatives to raise capital. The Company expects to require substantially more capital to fund its clinical,\ndevelopment and operational requirements, and therefore incur further losses over the next several years as it develops its clinical products. The Company has utilized, and\nexpects to continue to utilize, substantial amounts of funding to implement its business strategy. If the Company is unable to maintain adequate liquidity, future operations will\nneed to be scaled back or discontinued. Based on these circumstances, management has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Certain\ninformation or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and\nregulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial\nposition, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments,\nconsisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nperiod ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or for any future periods.\n9\nPrincipals of Consolidation\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TC BioPharm and its 100% controlled subsidiaries, TC BioPharm Limited, TC\nBioPharm Inc. and TC BioPharm BV. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. “TC BioPharm”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us” is\nintended to mean TC BioPharm (Holdings) plc, including the subsidiaries indicated above, unless otherwise indicated.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to\nother public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\n404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from\nthe requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until\nprivate companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a\ncompany can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out\nis irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application\ndates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or\nrevised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements with another public company which is neither an\nemerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential\ndifferences in accounting standards used.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set\nof circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more\nfuture confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company operates in one operating segment. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Company’s chief\noperating decision maker (“the CODM”). The Company’s CODM, its Chief Executive Officer, views the Company’s operations and manages its business as a single operating\nsegment, which is the business of a clinical stage immunotherapy Group pioneering commercialization of allogeneic, ‘off-the-shelf’ gamma-delta T cell (‘GD-T’) therapies.\n10\nIncome and Other Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard\nCodification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events\nthat have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial\nstatements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates\non deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent they believe these assets will more-likely-than-not be realized. In making such determination, the Company\nconsiders all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning\nstrategies and recent financial operations. In the event the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of its\nnet recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nIncome Tax Credit\nThe Company carries out extensive research and development activities, where it benefits from the United Kingdom’s research and development tax relief and\nexpenditure credit regimes. The Company is able to surrender some of its income tax losses for a cash rebate of up to 20% of expenditures related to eligible research and\ndevelopment projects. Such credits are accounted for, depending on the appropriate tax relief, either within the tax provision or other income, in the year in which the\nexpenditures were incurred.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company defines cash and cash equivalents as cash on hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term liquid investments with maturities of three\nmonths or less. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents was £1.0 million and £2.5 million, respectively.\nConcentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains\nsubstantially all of its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not incurred any losses\nassociated with this concentration of deposits.\nThe Company currently has bank deposits with financial institutions in the U.S. of approximately £0.2 million as of March 31, 2024 which are below the FDIC\ninsurance limits. FDIC insurance provides protection for bank deposits up to $250,000. The Company had approximately £0.8 million in uninsured bank deposits with financial\ninstitutions outside the U.S as of March 31, 2024. All uninsured bank deposits are held at high quality credit institutions.\nForeign currency transactions\nThe Company uses the British pound sterling as the reporting currency for its financial statements. Functional currency is the currency of the primary economic\nenvironment in which an entity operates. The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries are the local currencies. The Company has transactions denominated in various\ncurrencies, with the principal currency exposure being fluctuations in U.S. Dollars and Euros against pound sterling. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign\nexchange rates relates primarily to the limited number of supplier agreements denominated in currencies other than pound sterling.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consist of computer equipment, facility, and scientific equipment and office equipment, which are stated at cost, net of accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization, and depreciated over their estimated lives using the straight-line method.\n11\nDepreciation is provided for by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nProperty and Equipment Estimated Useful Life\nScientific equipment 4-10 years\nComputer equipment 3 years\nOffice equipment 5 years\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When assets have been retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed\nfrom the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets consist of software, patents and licenses. Intangible assets are recognized where it is probable that there will be a future economic benefit and that this\ncan be reliably measured. Software represents the historical cost of installation of third-party software used within the Company to maintain and control the Company’s quality\nsystem. The software is hosted and controlled on the Company’s servers and can be used independently of the related hardware. Software is amortized, on a straight-line basis,\nover the life of the relevant license of three to four years. Patent costs represent the costs of securing patents in relation to the Company’s intellectual property. Patent costs are\namortized, on a straight-line basis, over the remaining legal life of the relevant patents, which has an average estimated patent life of 16 years. License costs represent costs\nincurred for securing use of third-party technology. License costs are amortized, on a straight-line basis, over the life of the relevant license of three years. Amortization\nmethods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as appropriate.\nThe Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets where there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any\nsuch indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). The recoverable amount is determined\nfor an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets in which case the Company\nestimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. In\nassessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time\nvalue of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating\nunit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is\nrecognized immediately in the statement of operations. There was no impairment of tangible or intangible assets during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which primarily includes cash\nand cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued expenses, which approximate the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets due to\nthe liquid nature. The Company also has certain liability classified warrants that are being remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period and are categorized in\nLevel 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, the balance of the liability classified warrants was not material as of either March 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023 (see Note 12).\n12\nNet Loss per Share\nBasic net loss per share ordinary share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding in accordance with ASC Topic 260,\nEarnings per Share. Diluted net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential ordinary\nshares. When the Company reports a net loss, the calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential ordinary shares as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Potential\nordinary shares are composed of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants. The following table shows the basic and diluted loss per share for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Three Months For the Three Months\nEnded Ended\nMarch 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nNet loss £ (3,321,854) £ (634,911)\nBasic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding 30,138,602 2,051,836\nBasic and diluted loss per share £ (0.11) £ (0.31)\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements with employees, directors, and consultants and recognizes the compensation expense for share-\nbased awards based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. Compensation expense for all share-based awards is based on the estimated grant-date fair\nvalue and recognized in earnings over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period).\nResearch & Development Expenses\nResearch expenditure is expensed in the year in which it is incurred. Identifiable development expenditure is capitalized to the extent that the technical, commercial\nand financial feasibility can be demonstrated. The Company has not capitalized any development expenditures since inception.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company accounts for contingencies in accordance with ASC 450-20, Contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are\nissued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such\ncontingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the\nCompany or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the\nperceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\n13\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated\nliability would be accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is\nreasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and\nmaterial, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Further details are\nincluded within Note 7 to the financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements. Further, during\nDecember 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09-Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires entities\nto provide additional information in the rate reconciliation and additional disclosures about income taxes paid. The guidance should be applied prospectively and is effective for\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not expect the issued standard to have a material impact on its financial statements or results of\noperations.\nNOTE 3.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject\nto inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business.\n15\nIn accordance with the terms of a Convertible Loan Note (‘Note’) on August 9, 2022 (the Conversion Date) the Company issued 183,820 Ordinary Shares and 367,640\nlisted warrants to the Note holder in full satisfaction of the Note in the aggregate amount of $781,233. The holder filed a claim in the English courts on June 19, 2023 asserting\nthat notice was provided such that the Company should have paid it the value of the Note in cash, rather than by settling it through the issuance of Ordinary Shares and listed\nwarrants. The holder is demanding payment of the face value of the Note, together with interest, (approximately $860,000 as at the time of the initial filing of the claim). The\nlitigation process is in its early stages and is not expected to conclude until late 2024 or later. The Company has retained English solicitors and is contesting the claim in its\nentirety. The Company believes that it acted correctly under the terms of the Note and has accounted for the transaction on that basis, and that no further amounts are payable to\nthe holder.\nNOTE 8. LEASES\nThe Company leases certain office space under operating leases for use in operations. The Company recognizes operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over\nthe lease term. Management determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single component for all\nleases. Operating lease right to use (ROU) assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future lease payments over the\nexpected lease term, which includes optional renewal periods if we determine it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. As our leases do not provide an implicit\nrate, the discount rate used in the present value calculation represents our incremental borrowing rate determined using information available at the commencement date.\nOperating lease expense is included as a component of research and development and administrative expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of\noperations. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded operating lease expense of £86,785 and £86,291, respectively. Cash payments on\nlease liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 totaled £111,754 and £111,754, respectively. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, weighted-\naverage remaining lease term and discount rate were as follows:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term 4.91 years 5.11 years\nWeighted-average discount rate 8.6% 8.6%\nThe following is a maturity analysis of the annual undiscounted cash flows reconciled to the carrying value of the operating lease liabilities as of March 31, 2024:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024 £ 335,261\n2025 447,015\n2026 447,015\n2027 447,015\n2028 447,015\nLess imputed interest (395,194)\nTotal £ 1,728,127\nNOTE 9. CONVERTIBLE LOAN\nThe Company entered into a $20 million convertible loan note instrument in April 2021. The note has a 5% annual interest rate. During the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, the Company converted loan notes totaling $809,692 and $14,228,245, respectively, into ordinary shares and warrants and repaid $0 and $3,195,765, respectively, of\nthe convertible loan note. The convertible loan was recognized as a hybrid financial instrument and accounted for as two separate components: (i) a loan and (ii) an embedded\nconversion option derivative. As of December 31 2023, the convertible loan had either been fully paid down or converted. As such, the balance of both the convertible loan and\ncorresponding embedded derivative was $0 as of December 31, 2023.\n(i) The convertible loan’s initial fair value was the residual amount of the consideration received, net of attributable costs, after separating out the fair value of the\nembedded conversion option derivative. The loan was subsequently measured at its amortized cost.\n16\n(ii) The embedded conversion option derivative was initially measured at fair value and was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The embedded\nderivative could have been classified as a component of equity only if in all cases the contract would be settled by the Company delivering a fixed number of its own\nequity instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or debt redemption. That is, had the embedded instrument satisfied the “fixed-for-fixed” criteria outlined in ASC\n815-40. However, the convertible accounting outlined in ASC 815-40). Changes in the fair value (gains or losses) of the derivative at the end of instrument included a\nconversion feature resulting in settlement in a variable number of shares and consequently, was not considered indexed to the company’s shares (i.e. it did not qualify for\nthe scope exception to derivative each period were recorded in the consolidated statements of operations) for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nEmbedded\nResidual loan Derivative Total\nBalance at December 31, 2022 £ 653,484 £ 2,439 £ 655,923\nAccrued interest 71,568 - 71,568\nRepayment (639,336) (2,439) (641,775)\nModification of loan notes (53,619) - (53,619)\nCurrency adjustment (32,097) - (32,097)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 £ - £ - £ -\nThe value of the embedded derivative was remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, based on the Black-Scholes valuation model, with recognition of the changes in\nfair value in the consolidated statements of operations. As noted above, the value of the embedded derivative liability as of December 31, 2023 was $0.\nNOTE 10. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOrdinary shares\nThe Ordinary shares have no specific rights, preferences or restrictions attached to them.\nDeferred shares\nDeferred shares have the following properties:\na. do not entitle their holders to receive any dividend or other distribution;\nb. do not entitle their holders to receive a share certificate in respect of the relevant shareholding;\nc. do not entitle their holders to receive notice of, nor to attend, speak or vote at, any general meeting of the Company;\n17\nd. entitles their holders on a return of capital on a winding up of the Company (but not otherwise) only to the repayment of the amount paid up on that share after\npayment of the capital paid up on each Ordinary Share in the share capital of the Company and the further payment of £100,000,000 on each ordinary share;\ne. do not entitle their holders to any further participation in the capital, profits or assets of the Company. The Deferred Shares shall not be capable of transfer at any time\nother than with the prior written consent of the directors of the Company.\nA Ordinary shares\nThe A Ordinary shares ranked equally with all other shares in issue in that on a vote every member has one vote for each share held. The A ordinary shares contain\npreferential economic rights such that, in the event of a share or asset sale (as defined in the Articles of Association), they provide a return to the holders of the A Ordinary\nShares of an amount greater than or equal to 1.5x the price paid by the investors for A Ordinary Shares. The A Ordinary shares have an anti-dilution provision where shares are\nsubsequently issued at a price below £215.00 per share, whereby the existing A Ordinary shareholders receive additional compensation shares in line with the formula set out in\nthe Articles of Association. The A Ordinary shares rank equally with all other shares in issue with respect to dividends.\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO, 493,860 ordinary shares were issued, under the terms of the Articles of Association to certain shareholders who, prior\nto the IPO, owned A Ordinary shares which carried the right, to subscribe at nominal value for a certain number of additional shares, calculated by reference to the pre-money\nvaluation of the IPO. As part of the IPO share issue, the Company re-organized its share capital whereby all of the outstanding series A ordinary shares were re-designated as\nordinary shares of the Company on a one for one basis and as such no anti-dilution provisions are included within the issued shares.\nReorganization and IPO\nImmediately prior to completion of the IPO, the Company re-organized its share capital whereby all of the outstanding series A ordinary shares were re-designated as\nordinary shares of TC BioPharm (Holdings) plc on a one for one basis. Immediately prior to the completion of the offering, a further 493,860 ordinary shares were issued,\nunder the terms of the Articles of Association to certain shareholders who, prior to the IPO, owned A ordinary shares which carried the right, to subscribe at nominal value for a\ncertain number of additional shares, calculated by reference to the pre-money valuation of the IPO. The fair value of the shares issued was £3.8 million.\nShare Issuances\nDuring January of 2023, the Company issued 65,750 or 1,315,000 ordinary shares, par value £0.0001 per share of Company, based on a price per share of £0.0001 on\nexercise of pre-funded warrants that had been issued in prior financing rounds. As the pre-funded warrants contained a nominal exercise price, the exercise of the pre-funded\nwarrants resulted in nominal proceeds to the Company.\nOn March 27, 2023, the Company, entered into a Second Securities Purchase Agreement with Investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell an\naggregate of 10,750 ADSs, or 215,000 ordinary shares, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 161,125 ADSs, and Series C purchase warrants to purchase up to 171,875 ADSs\nSecurities. In addition, the Company also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 12,891 ADSs. The purchase price for each ADS and associated Ordinary Warrants was\n$32 (on a post-split basis) and the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Ordinary Warrants was $31.98 (on a post-split basis). The Ordinary Warrants\nwere immediately exercisable, expire five (5) years from the date of issuance and the Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants\nare exercised in full. The total net proceeds from this offering were approximately £4.0 million (or $4.9 million), after deducting estimated offering expenses of approximately\n£0.5 million.\n18\nOn March 27, 2023, the Company also agreed that certain existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 140,000 ADSs of the Company that were previously\nissued on November 30, 2022, at an exercise price of $100 (on a post-split basis) per ADS and expiration dates of May 30, 2025 and May 30, 2028, were amended effective\nupon the closing of the Offering so that the amended warrants will have a reduced exercise price of $35 (on a post-split basis) per ADS. To account for the modification, the\nCompany recognized the increase in fair value of the modified warrants (measured as the difference between the fair value immediately before and after the modification) a as a\ncharge against the gross proceeds of the offering.\nDuring January of 2024, the Company issued 1,398,000 or 27,960,000 ordinary shares, par value £0.0001 per share of Company, based on a price per share of £0.0001\non exercise of pre-funded warrants that had been issued in prior financing rounds. As the pre-funded warrants contained a nominal exercise price, the exercise of the pre-funded\nwarrants resulted in nominal proceeds to the Company.\nOn March 11, 2024, the company issued 121,070 ADSs or 2,421,400 ordinary shares, par value £0.0001 per share of Company, based on a price per share of £0.0001\non exercise of share options that had been issued to a consultant as part of the consideration for undertaking consulting services. The issued shares options were recognized as\nnon-employee compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718. Further, the fair value of the shares (as determined utilizing the Black Scholes valuation model) will be\nrecognized over the estimated one-year consulting service period. Approximately £6,356 was recognized during the three month period ended March 31, 2024.\nOn March 11, 2024, the Company issued 23,808 ADSs or 476,153 ordinary shares, par value £0.0001 per share of Company to Bryan Kobel, the Chief Executive\nOfficer of the Company following an agreement to convert an aggregate amount of approximately £19,765 (or approximately $24,760) of accrued but unpaid contractual\npension benefits owed to him. The issued ADSs were based on a price per ADS equal to the closing price of the Company’s ADSs on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 7,\n2024.\n19\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company issued 623,750 ADSs representing 12,475,000 ordinary shares of the Company upon exercise of outstanding Series D warrants\nresulting in gross cash proceeds to the Company of £986,772 (approximately $1,263,000), which included £73,980 of offering costs.\nADS Ratio Change\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company changed its ratio of ADSs ordinary shares from one ADS representing one ordinary share to one ADS representing 20 ordinary\nshares. As a result of the ratio change, all references in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to units of ordinary shares\nunderlying ADSs are reflective of the ratio change for all periods presented. In addition, the exercise prices and the numbers of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of\nany outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares were proportionally adjusted pursuant to the respective anti-dilution terms of the share-based payment plans.\nNOTE 11. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nEnterprise Management Incentive (EMI) share option scheme\nThe Company operates an HMRC Approved Enterprise Management Incentive (“EMI”) share option scheme for employees. Effective December 16, 2014, the\nCompany approved a share option scheme under which the Board of Directors of the Company can award options to directors, officers, employees and consulting personnel of\nthe Company. The Board of Directors will determine the terms, limitations, restrictions and conditions of the options granted under the plan.\nThe Company has granted options over ADSs to certain employees.\nNumber of Weighted Average\nShare Options Exercise Price\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 5,328 £ 460\nGranted during the period - -\nExercised during the period - -\nForfeited during the period - -\nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 5,328 £ 460\nExerciseable at March 31, 2024 5,328 £ 460\nUnexerciseable at March 31, 2024 - -\n20\nThe estimated fair value of the options outstanding in the period was calculated by applying a Monte Carlo Simulation for those options issued in 2020 and 2019 and a\nBlack Scholes Model for those options issued in prior periods. The most appropriate approach is selected with reference to the share capital structure at the time of grant. The\nexpense recognized for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was £0 as all options were fully vested as\nof March 31, 2024.\n2021 Share Option Scheme\nEffective immediately prior to completion of the IPO on February 10, 2022, the Company adopted a new share option scheme, or the 2021 Share Option Scheme, for\nthe purpose granting share options to incentivize the Company’s directors, employees and consultants. The 2021 Share Option Scheme incorporates a sub-plan for option\nholders subject to taxation in the United States, or the 2021 U.S. Sub-Plan, to provide for the grant of U.S. qualified incentive options.\nThe Company has granted options over ADSs to certain employees and directors.\nNumber of Weighted Average\n* Share Options Exercise Price\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 37,066 $ 230\nGranted during the period 999,838 1.07\nExercised during the period (121,070) .0025\nCancelled during the period (933) 4,240\nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 914,901 $ 6.01\nExerciseable at March 31, 2024 914,901 $ 6.01\nUnexerciseable at March 31, 2024 - -\nThe totals of options and related exercise price are for options over ADSs and reflect the ratio change on December 15, 2023.\nThe estimated fair value of the options outstanding in the period was calculated by applying a Black Scholes Model. The most appropriate approach is selected with\nreference to the share capital structure at the time of grant. The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during the three month period ended March 31, 2024\nwas $0.93. No options were granted during the threemonth period ended March 31, 2023. The expense recognized for share-based payments in respect of employee and non-\nemployee services received during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was £784,555.\nThe options granted under the 2021 share option scheme will typically vest over three years after the date of grant. In some cases, options granted to senior\nmanagement vested immediately. As of March 31, 2024, there were no remaining unvested options.\n21\nModifications\nDuring March of 2024, share options that had been granted to five grantees, including one of our executive officers and all of our non-employee directors, were\ncancelled and replaced by new options with different terms. The company determined that the option cancellations and subsequent re-issuances should be considered award\nmodifications and be recognized in accordance with the guidance in ASC 718-20. As the new awards vested immediately, the Company fully recognized the incremental fair\nvalue of the awards of £248,659.\nAdditional Right to Subscribe for Shares\nOn August 25, 2020, the Company issued Ordinary shares, which included an additional right to subscribe for a fixed number (15,891) of shares at £215.00 per share\nat a future date based on certain clinical and commercial milestones. The estimated fair value of the right to subscribe was calculated by applying a Black Scholes Model. This\nwas deemed the most appropriate approach due to the future liquidity event being date-uncertain and could take one of many forms.\nNOTE 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with\nthe sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with\nmeasuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to\nclassify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\nLevel 1:Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or\nliability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2:Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted\nprices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3:Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of £1.0 million as of March 31, 2024. The cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value due to the liquid nature of\nthe instruments and are measured in Level 1.\nIn addition, the Company also had numerous outstanding warrants that were classified in Level 2 due to our use of implied volatility in determining the expected\nvolatility input for purposes of determining the instruments fair value via the Black-Scholes valuation model. The details of the issued warrants were as follows:\n22\nUnlisted warrants in issue\nSeries A warrants\nThe fair value of each of the warrants was approximately $0.06 and $0.37 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe inputs associated with calculating the fair value of the warrants are considered to be Level 2 and were valued using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The inputs were\nas follows:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nExercise price $ 100.00 $ 100.00\nShare price $ 1.31 $ 3.17\nTime to maturity 4.17 years 4.4 years\nExpected volatility 90% 90%\nRisk free interest rate (US treasury bond) 3.9% 4.0%\nDividend yield - -\nSeries B warrants\nThe fair value of each of the warrants was approximately $0.00 and $0.02 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe inputs associated with calculating the fair value of the warrants are considered to be Level 2 and were valued using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The inputs were\nas follows:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nExercise price $ 100.00 $ 100.00\nShare price $ 1.31 $ 3.17\nTime to maturity 1.16 years 1.4 years\nExpected volatility 90% 90%\nRisk free interest rate (US treasury bond) 4.3% 4.0%\nDividend yield - -\n23\nSeries A-B placement agent warrants\nThe fair value of each of the warrants was $0.04 and $0.31 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe inputs associated with calculating the fair value of the warrants are considered to be Level 2 and were valued using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The inputs were\nas follows:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nExercise price $ 125.00 $ 125.00\nShare price $ 1.31 $ 3.17\nTime to maturity 4.17 years 4.4 years\nExpected volatility 90% 90%\nRisk free interest rate (US treasury bond) 3.9% 4.0%\n- -\nSeries C placement agent warrants\nThe fair value of each of the warrants was $0.12 and $0.69 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe inputs associated with calculating the fair value of the warrants are considered to be Level 2 and were valued using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The inputs were\nas follows:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nExercise price $ 40.00 $ 40.00\nShare price $ 1.31 $ 3.17\nTime to maturity 3.99 years 4.2 years\nExpected volatility 90% 90%\nRisk free interest rate (US treasury bond) 4.5% 4.0%\nDividend yield - -\nSeries D warrants\nThe fair value of each of the warrants was $8.46 as of the August 30, 2023 issuance date. As the warrants were equity classified, they were not re-measured to fair value as\nof December 31, 2023. The warrants were subsequently exercised in full on March 12, 2024.\nNOTE 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nManagement evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date, up to the date that the financial statements were issued. Based\nupon this review, other than as set forth below, management did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial\nstatements.\nOn May 6, 2024, the Company, entered into a letter agreement (the “Inducement Letter”) with certain holders (the “Holders”) of existing Series E warrants (the\n“Existing Warrants”) to purchase ordinary shares represented by american depositary shares (the “ADSs”) of the Company. The Existing Warrants were issued on December 21,\n2023 and have an exercise price of £1.5814 per ADS. Each ADS represents twenty (20) ordinary shares of the Company.\nPursuant to the Inducement Letter, the Holders agreed to exercise for cash their Existing Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,750,000 ADSs of the Company for\ncash and the payment of £0.099625 (US$0.125) per new warrant in consideration for the Company’s agreement to issue new Series F warrants to purchase ordinary shares\nrepresented by ADSs (the “New Warrants”), as described below, to purchase up to 70,000,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares represented by 3,500,000 ADSs (the “New\nWarrant ADSs”). The Company expects to receive aggregate gross proceeds of approximately £3.1 million from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Holders, prior to\ndeducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses.\nThe Company engaged H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (the “Placement Agent”) to act as its exclusive placement agent in connection with the transactions summarized\nabove and has agreed to pay the Placement Agent a cash fee equal to 7.5% of the gross proceeds received from the Holders’ exercise of their Existing Warrants and a\nmanagement fee of 1% of the gross proceeds received from the Holders’ exercise of their Existing Warrants. The Company has also agreed to reimburse the Placement Agent\nfor its expenses in connection with the exercise of the Existing Warrants and the issuance of the New Warrants, up to $50,000 for fees and expenses of legal counsel and other\nout-of-pocket expenses, and agreed to pay the Placement Agent for non-accountable expenses in the amount of $35,000 and a clearing fee of $15,950. Upon any exercise for\ncash of any New Warrants, the Company has agreed to pay the Placement Agent a cash fee of 7.5% of the aggregate gross exercise price paid in cash with respect the exercise\nof the New Warrants. In addition, the Company granted warrants (“Placement Agent Warrants”) to the Placement Agent, or its designees, to purchase up to an aggregate of\n2,625,020 ordinary shares represented by 131,251 ADSs, which Placement Agent Warrants shall be substantially in the same form as the New Warrants except that the\nPlacement Agent Warrants will have an exercise price of £2.2313.\n24\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in\nthis Quarterly Report and our audited financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwhich was filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. This discussion and analysis and other parts of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking statements based upon current\nbeliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and projections.\nOur actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including\nthose set forth under Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. You should carefully read the “Risk Factors” section of this Quarterly Report\nand of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from our forward-looking statements. Please also see the section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a cell-based product pipeline capable of treating a variety of disorders including cancer and infectious disease.\nWe are currently developing a pipeline of unmodified allogeneic GD-T therapies and next generation GD CAR-T treatments with a number of advantages over conventional\napproaches. We own our main patent families in the GD CAR-T space, providing robust IP protection and manufactures all products in-house, leading to a much lower cost of\ngoods than competitor products.\nIn-house clinical studies have demonstrated that our unmodified allogeneic GD-T products are (i) well tolerated and (ii) show preliminary evidence of disease\nmodification in patients with the late-stage blood cancer, known as acute myeloid leukemia – AML. Based on clinical data generated by us, we believe that unmodified GD-Ts\nhave the potential to treat all blood cancers.\nThe Company’s lead product, TCB-008, is now in phase 2b-into-pivotal (phase 3) clinical studies with a view to launching its first oncology product for the treatment\nof AML. Clinical results generated thus far have enabled us to obtain FDA orphan drug status for treatment of AML.\nIn addition to unmodified allogenic GD-Ts for treatment of blood cancers, we are also developing an expanded platform for TCB-008 use case in anti-fungal, anti-viral\nand anti-microbial diseases. We believe TCB-008 can be impactful in immune-suppressed and immune-compromised patient populations, including cancer patients, to treat and\nact as a prophylactic in these disease verticals.\nIn order to manufacture our portfolio of allogeneic products, we select the highest quality GD-T cells from healthy donors, activate the cells and grow them in large\nnumbers at our in-house GMP-compliant manufacturing facility before administration to a patient in order to target and then destroy malignant or virally-infected tissues. We\nbelieve that we have introduced a step-change to our manufacturing platform by implementing a freeze-thaw process that will allow product to be shipped from cleanroom to\npatient without any shelf-life issue. Resulting products, we believe, will be more cost-effective and straightforward to ship from cleanroom to clinic. Our team continues to\nimprove and optimize our process based on data and new technologies being developed globally.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe do not have any approved products. Accordingly, we have not generated any revenue from the sale of products, and we do not expect to generate any such revenue\nunless and until we obtain regulatory approvals for, and commercialize any of, our product candidates. In the future, we will seek to generate revenue primarily from product\nsales and, potentially, regional or global collaborations with strategic partners, which may produce license fee income.\nSince inception through March 31, 2024, the Company has received £14.5 million in pre-clinical payments connected with CAR-T development partnerships. These\npartnerships are no longer actively being progressed and it is unlikely that we will receive any future milestone revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into two categories: research and development expenses and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, including salaries, benefits,\nbonuses and share-based payment expense, comprise a significant component of each of these expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with personnel costs based\non the function performed by the respective employees.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe largest component of our total operating expenses since inception has been costs related to our research and development activities, including the preclinical and\nclinical development of our product candidates.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred, with our development activities not yet at the point at which capitalization can occur under GAAP. Our\nresearch and development expense primarily consist of:\n● consumable costs related to research and development of pharmaceutical or biologic therapy products for preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● costs related to manufacturing active pharmaceutical or biologic therapy products for preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● salaries and personnel-related costs, including bonuses, benefits and any share-based payment expense, for our personnel performing research and development\nactivities or managing those activities that have been out-sourced;\n● fees paid to consultants and other third parties who support our product candidate development;\n25\n● third party costs incurred in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials from investigative sites and contract research organizations, or CROs;\n● other costs incurred in seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates;\n● costs of related office space allocated to our research and development function, materials and equipment; and\n● payments under our license agreements.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher\ndevelopment costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. In addition, the cost of\ndevelopment of our CAR-T range of products is likely to be substantially higher than costs incurred historically in the development of our unmodified products. Accordingly,\nwe expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to\naccurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our\nproduct candidates to offset these expenses. Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in\ntiming and cost to completion.\nThe duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors including:\n● the scope, rate of progress, results and expenses of our ongoing and future clinical trials, preclinical studies and research and development activities;\n● the potential need for additional clinical trials or preclinical studies requested by regulatory agencies;\n● potential uncertainties in clinical trial enrolment rates or drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;\n● competition with other drug development companies in, and the related expense of, identifying and enrolling patients in our clinical trials and contracting with third-\nparty manufacturers for the production of the drug product needed for our clinical trials;\n● the achievement of milestones requiring payments under in-licensing agreements;\n● any significant changes in government regulation;\n● the terms and timing of any regulatory approvals;\n● the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and\n● the ease, cost and ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates, if approved.\nWe track research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis for both clinical-stage and preclinical product candidates. Manufacturing, clinical trial\nand preclinical research and development expenses are assigned or allocated to individual product candidates. We do not allocate employee costs or facility expenses, including\ndepreciation or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal\nresources primarily to oversee research and development as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development\nactivities.\n26\nAdministrative Expenses\nAdministrative expenses consist of personnel costs, other administrative expenses and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit and\naccounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense. Other administrative expenses include office space-related\ncosts not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees and costs of our information systems. We anticipate that our administrative expenses will\nincrease in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We expect to\ncontinue to incur additional expenses as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, additional insurance\nexpenses, and expenses related to investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nThe gain/loss relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative related to the issue of Convertible Loan Notes, calculated by using a\nBlack Scholes option pricing model at the end of each reporting period. The gain/loss relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of our warrants, calculated by using a\nBlack Scholes option pricing model at the end of each reporting period. As it pertains to the issued warrants, it is important to note that as of March 31, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 they were primarily equity classified and therefore are no longer required to be re-measured to fair value at the end of each reporting period.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes the effective interest charge accrued in relation to the Convertible Loan Notes. Interest expense is offset by interest income related to interest\nearned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits.\nIncome Tax Credit\nWe are subject to corporate taxation in the United Kingdom. Due to the nature of our business, we have generated losses since inception. Our income tax credit\nrecognized represents the sum of the research and development tax credits recoverable in the United Kingdom.\nAs a company that carries out extensive research and development activities, we benefit from the United Kingdom research and development tax credit regime and are\nable to surrender some of our losses for a cash rebate of up to 20% of expenditures related to eligible research and development projects. Qualifying expenditures largely\ncomprise clinical trial and manufacturing costs, employment costs for relevant staff and consumables incurred as part of research and development projects. A large portion of\ncosts relating to our research and development, clinical trials and manufacturing activities are eligible for inclusion within these tax credit cash rebate claims.\nThere can be no certainty that we will be able to continue to claim research and development tax credits in the future. Tax losses that have not been utilized to offset\ntaxable income or surrendered in connection with the aforementioned research and development tax credits are carried forward to be offset against future taxable profits. In the\nevent we generate revenues in the future, we may benefit from the United Kingdom’s government’s “patent box” initiative that allows profits attributable to revenues from\npatents and/or patented products registered in the United Kingdom or European Union to be taxed at a lower rate than other streams of revenue. The current rate of tax for\nrelevant streams of revenue for companies receiving this relief is 10%.\n27\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations:\nFor the Three For the Three\nMonths Ended Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 £ Change % Change\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development expenses 1,298,942 1,934,304 (635,362) (32.8)%\nAdministrative expenses 2,142,714 2,231,461 (88,747) (4.0)%\nTotal operating expenses 3,441,656 4,165,765 (724,109) (17.4)%\nLoss from operations (3,441,656) (4,165,765) 724,109 (17.4)%\nOther income (expense):\nChange in fair value of derivatives 11,446 3,148,648 (3,137,202) (99.6)%\nOther expense, net (2,386) (17,794) 15,408 (86.6)%\nTotal other income (expense), net 9,060 3,130,854 (3,121,794) (99.7)%\nNet loss before income taxes (3,432,596) (1,034,911) (2,397,685) 231.7%\nIncome tax credit 110,742 400,000 (289,258) (72.3)%\nNet loss £ (3,321,854) £ (634,911) £ (2,686,943) 423.2%\nResearch and Development Expenses\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\n£’000’s £’000’s £ Change % Change\nDirect research and development expenses by program:\nUnmodified cell therapy programs(1) £ 316 £ 446 £ (130) (29.2)%\nOther research and development programs(2) 21 188 (167) (88.9)%\nTotal direct research and development expense 337 634 (298) (46.9)%\nResearch and development and unallocated costs:\nPersonnel related (including share-based compensation) 620 896 (277) (30.9)%\nIndirect research and development expense(3) 343 404 (61) (15.1)%\nTotal research and development expenses £ 1,299 £ 1,934 £ (635) (32.8)%\n(1) Unmodified cell therapy programs include OmnImmune® and ImmuniStim®\n(2) Other research and development programs include expenditure on areas such as our CAR-T program and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).\n(3) Indirect research and development expense includes property related costs and depreciation and amortization.\nResearch and development expenses decreased by 33% to £1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from £1.9 million for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023, which was primarily driven by a decrease in direct and indirect research expenses due to a refocus of the clinical strategy and consequently a decrease in\npersonnel.\n28\nGeneral and administrative\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023 £ Change % Change\n£’000’s £’000’s\nShare-based compensation expense 785 100 £ 685 686.9)%\nEmployee-related costs 464 688 (224) (32.6)%\nLegal & professional fees 827 1,345 (517) (38.5)%\nOther expenses 67 99 (32) (32.5)%\nTotal administrative expenses 2,143 2,231 (89) (4.0)%\nAdministrative expenses decreased by 4% to £2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from £2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nThe decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in employee-related costs and a decrease in legal and professional fees, offset by an increase in share-based compensation\nexpense.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nThe change in fair value of derivative liability is comprised of the change in fair values of the convertible loan derivative, warrant derivative, and other derivatives.\nThe change in the fair value of the embedded convertible loan derivatives relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nThe change in fair value of the warrant derivatives for the three months ended March 31, 2024 relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of our issued\ndetachable warrants. The warrants were issued at the time of the IPO and at various times during each of the two years ended December 31, 2023. In addition, certain warrants\nwere both modified and induced over the course of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. All of our issued warrants are valued by using the Black Scholes option pricing\nmodel.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net is comprised of foreign currency (losses) gains and interest (expense) income. Interest expense decreased by 100% during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was due to the Convertible Loan Note being paid off during 2023. Interest expense was\npartially offset by interest income earned on cash accounts. The change in foreign currency (losses) increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to a higher foreign exchange rate during 2024.\nIncome tax credit\nThe research and development tax credit of £0.1 million was 72% lower for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to £0.4 million for the three months\nended March 31, 2023. This was due to lower levels of expenditure eligible for research and development tax credits and changes in the UK tax rules around research and\ndevelopment tax credits.\nAfter accounting for tax credits receivable, there were accumulated tax losses for carry forward in the United Kingdom of £18.3 million as of March 31, 2024.\nUnrecognized deferred tax assets totaling £4.9 million as of March 31, 2024 consist of temporary differences on tax losses and share-based compensation arrangements. No\ndeferred tax asset is recognized in respect of accumulated tax losses or temporary differences on share-based compensation arrangements because future profits are not\nsufficiently certain.\nGoing Concern\nOur existing cash of £1.0 million as of March 31, 2024 will not be sufficient to enable us to conduct our business 12 months from the issuance of these financial\nstatements. We will need additional funding to complete the development and research of our products. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we\nwould be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development efforts.\nOn May 8, 2023, the Group had cash on hand of $4.0 million (£3.2 million), which will not be sufficient to enable the Group to meet the cash requirements required to\nenable it to conduct its business plan through the going concern period (being to May 15, 2025) (“Going Concern Period”). With existing resources, we expect to be able to\nfund current operations into July 2024.\n29\nAs a result of the Company’s recurring losses from operations, and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements, there is uncertainty\nregarding the Company’s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred net losses of £3.3 million and £0.6 million, respectively. We used £2.4 million of cash in operating\nactivities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and used £2.9 million of cash in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of £1.0 million and £2.5 million, respectively. From incorporation through March 31,\n2024, we have financed our operations primarily through our IPO, private placements of equity securities, convertible loans, government grants, research and development tax\ncredits, and receipts from partner for collaborative research and development services totaling £83.0 million.\nWhile we work towards obtaining regulatory approval to advance any of our GD-T cell therapeutic candidates into pivotal clinical trials or to commercialization, we\nwill incur significant research and development expenses, and also commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution and\nadditional funding would be required. Where appropriate, we will seek to fund our operations through milestone payments under our agreements with collaboration partners\nand additional equity financings.\nCash Flows\nThe following tables summarize the results of our cash flows for the below respective periods:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities £ (2,408,593) £ (2,911,247)\nInvesting activities £ (5,618) £ (145,233)\nFinancing activities £ 932,557 £ 3,954,238\nChange in cash £ (1,481,654) £ 897,758\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was £2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was £3.3\nmillion, which was offset by noncash items of £0.9 million, consisting of £0.1 million in depreciation and amortization, £0.8 million in share-based compensation expense, and\nless than £0.1 million in the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Changes in working capital amounted to less than £0.1 million, which consisted of a decrease in\nthe corporation tax receivable and lease liabilities, offset by an increase in prepaid expenses, operating lease right of use assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities was £2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was £0.6\nmillion, which was offset by noncash items of £2.6 million, consisting of £0.2 million in depreciation and amortization, £0.1 million in share-based compensation expense, a\n£3.1 million change in the fair value of the derivative liability, and £0.2 million in offering costs related to the Series C Placement Agent Warrants. Changes in working capital\nprovided £0.3 million in cash.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was immaterial for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and £0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These\namounts relate primarily to purchases of property and equipment related to our facility and patent filing costs.\n30\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash from financing activities was £0.9 million and £3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, these amounts consisted of net proceeds from sale of own shares and warrants for £1.0 million offset by issuance costs of £0.1 million. For the three months\nended March 31, 2023, these amounts consisted of net proceeds from sale of own shares and warrants for £4.1 million offset by issuance costs of £0.2 million.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our\nproduct candidates. Our expenses will increase as we (i) advance our product candidates through phases of clinical development and, potentially, registration, (ii) fund our\nresearch and development activities to further expand our GD-T cell technologies and develop future product candidates and follow-on versions of our more advanced product\ncandidates, (iii) fund our manufacturing activities and the expansion of our plant to support our ongoing and future clinical trials and potential commercial launch; and (iv) fund\nour general operations.\nSince February 10, 2022, we have been a publicly traded company and incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur as a\nprivate company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, requires public companies to implement\nspecified corporate governance practices. We expect to continue to incur substantial legal and financial compliance costs, which may make some activities more time-\nconsuming and costly.\nWe will require additional capital to continue to conduct our business and implement our business plans.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical product candidates, we are unable to\nestimate the amount of our future working capital requirements, which will depend on and are likely to increase significantly as a result of many uncertain factors, including:\n● the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n● the costs, timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n● the costs of future sales and marketing activities, including cost of product sales, medical regulatory affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our\nproduct candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n● the amount and timing of the receipt of any future revenue from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and\nbecome successful in the market;\n● the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to progress research and development and clinical trials;\n● the costs and timing of hiring new employees to support our future growth;\n● the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related\nclaims; and\n● the cost of and extent to which we in-license or acquire additional product candidates or technologies.\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our future cash needs through equity offerings\nand debt and a combination thereof, including securities convertible into ordinary shares and through development collaborations with partners. To the extent that we raise\nadditional capital through the sale of equity, our shareholders’ ownership interest will be diluted.\n31\nIf we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaborations agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution\narrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that\nmay not be favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization\nefforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. If we raise funding through\nborrowings, we may have to enter into onerous covenants which may adversely impact our operations and our ability to obtain further funding.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to raise any further funding, or if further funding is offered, it will be on terms that are acceptable to us and may bring\ndilution which is unacceptable to our shareholders.\nThe source, timing, and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions, and, more specifically, on the progress of our clinical\ndevelopment program. Funding may not be available when needed, at all, or on terms acceptable to us. Lack of necessary funds may require us to, among other things, delay,\nscale back or eliminate expenses including some or all our planned development, including our clinical trials. While we may need to raise funds in the future, we believe the\ncurrent cash reserves should be sufficient to fund our operation for the foreseeable future. Because of these factors, we believe that this creates doubt about our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2024 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in\nfuture periods:\nPayments due by period\nLess Than More Than\nTotal 1 Year –1 - 3 Years –4 - 5 Years 5 Years\nTrade payables £ 1,927,612 £ 1,927,612 £ – £ – £ –\nLease liabilities 2,123,321 335,261 894,030 894,030 –\nPayables related to clinical trial testing 1,177,500 1,177,500 – – –\nOther payables 1,348,335 1,348,335 – – –\nTotal commitments £ 6,576,768 £ 4,788,708 £ 894,030 £ 894,030 £ -\nLease liabilities\nAmounts shown as lease liabilities and similar reflect minimum payments due for our leases of office, laboratory and manufacturing space. We entered into a lease for\nour corporate headquarters in April 2014 and, as part of this agreement, exercised an option to lease additional space in January 2017 and March 2019. The overall lease expires\nin February 2029.\nOther commitments\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third parties who support us in the conduct of certain specialist aspects of clinical trials and preclinical\nresearch studies and testing. These contracts are generally cancellable by us upon prior notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided\nor expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the preceding table, as the\namount and timing of such payments are not known.\nWe have not included any contingent payment obligations that we may incur upon achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, as applicable, or\nroyalty payments that we may be required to make under in-licensing agreements which we have or may enter into which could be payable if any of our products generate\nfuture sales or license revenue as the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known and are not anticipated in the near term or before we generate significant\nrevenues.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nour assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances\nand evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n32\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to a\nmaterial weakness in our internal control over accounting for complex financial instruments (including in determining the appropriate valuation basis in areas requiring\nsignificant judgement) and in the accounting for our property leases on conversion from IFRS to GAAP. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated,\ncannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the period ended March\n31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n33\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various disputes, claims, suits, investigations, and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the\nresolution of current pending legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Nonetheless, we\ncannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, as legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn accordance with the terms of a Convertible Loan Note (‘Note’) on August 9, 2022 (the Conversion Date) the Company issued 183,820 Ordinary Shares and 367,640 listed\nwarrants to the Note holder in full satisfaction of the Note in the aggregate amount of $781,233. The holder filed a claim in the English courts on June 19, 2023 asserting that\nnotice was provided such that the Company should have paid it the value of the Note in cash, rather than by settling it through the issuance of Ordinary Shares and listed\nwarrants. The holder is demanding payment of the face value of the Note, together with interest, (approximately $860,000 as at the time of the initial filing of the claim). The\nlitigation process is in its early stages and is not expected to conclude until late 2024 or later. The Company has retained English solicitors and is contesting the claim in its\nentirety. The Company believes that it acted correctly under the terms of the Note and has accounted for the transaction on that basis, and that no further amounts are payable to\nthe holder.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our risk factors from those included in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nWe did not repurchase any of our equity securities during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNone.\nItem 5.

We make such forward-looking statements\npursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical\nfacts contained in this Annual Report are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “will”,\n“should”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential”, “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable\nterminology.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance, and are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding\nthe future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements\nrelate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control.\nTherefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from\nthose indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n● the ultimate impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, or any other health epidemic, on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition\nand liquidity, and the global economy as a whole;\n● the sufficiency of our existing cash and cash equivalents to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months and our need to raise\nadditional capital;\n● our ability to generate revenue from products;\n● our limited operating history;\n● our ability to maintain proper and effective internal financial controls;\n● our ability to continue to operate as a going concern;\n● changes in laws, government regulations and policies and interpretations thereof;\n● our ability to obtain and maintain protection for our intellectual property;\n● our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel;\n● our ability to manage our rapid growth and organizational change effectively;\n● the possibility of security vulnerabilities, cyberattacks and network disruptions, including breaches of data security and privacy leaks, data loss, and business\ninterruptions;\n● our compliance with data privacy laws and regulations;\n● our ability to develop and maintain our brand cost-effectively; and\n● the other factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K and are subject to business and economic risks. We do not undertake any obligation to update or\nrevise the forward-looking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which such statements were made, except to the extent required by\nlaw.\n3\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel immunotherapy products based on our proprietary allogeneic gamma delta T (GD-T)\ncell platform. Harnessing the innate ability of GD-Ts has enabled us to develop a range of clinical-stage cell therapies designed to combat cancer and viral infection.\nIn-house clinical studies have demonstrated that our unmodified allogeneic GD-T products are (i) well tolerated and (ii) show preliminary evidence of disease\nmodification in patients with the late-stage blood cancer, known as acute myeloid leukemia – AML. Based on clinical data generated by us believe that unmodified GD-Ts have\nthe potential to treat all blood cancers.\nTCB now is embarking on phase 2b-into-pivotal (phase 3) clinical studies with a view to launching its first oncology product for the treatment of AML. Clinical results\ngenerated thus far have enabled us to obtain FDA orphan drug status for treatment of AML.\nIn addition to unmodified allogenic GD-Ts for treatment of blood cancers, we are also developing an innovative range of genetically-modified CAR-T products for\ntreatment of solid cancers. We believe that solid cancers are more difficult to treat than blood cancers and may require the addition of a CAR “chimeric antigen receptor” (i) to\nhelp therapeutic cells to “navigate” into diseased cancerous tissue and (ii) to retain therapeutic cells in-situ at the lesion for maximal efficacy (increased persistence).\nIn order to manufacture our portfolio of allogeneic products, we select the highest quality GD-T cells from healthy donors, activate the cells and grow them in large\nnumbers at our in-house GMP-compliant manufacturing facility before administration to a patient in order to target and then destroy malignant or virally-infected tissues. We\nbelieve that we have introduced a step-change to our manufacturing platform by implementing a freeze-thaw process that will allow product to be shipped from cleanroom to\npatient without any shelf-life issue. Resulting products, we believe, will be more cost-effective and straightforward to ship form cleanroom to clinic.\nHistory and Development of the Company\nWe are a public company with limited liability incorporated on October 25, 2021, pursuant to the laws of Scotland, under the name TC BioPharm (Holdings) plc. We\nwere incorporated with nominal share capital for the purpose of becoming the ultimate holding company of TC BioPharm Limited, the company in which our principal clinical,\nresearch and development operations have been and are currently undertaken, and for the purpose of consummating the corporate reorganization described herein. TC BioPharm\n(Holdings) plc will not conduct any operations except those as the listed entity, as explained below.\nTC BioPharm Limited was incorporated on July 1, 2013, as a private company with limited liability pursuant to the laws of Scotland and conducts our principal\nclinical. research and development operations. TC BioPharm Limited has two wholly owned subsidiaries:\n● TC BioPharm BV, The Netherlands – incorporated March 2019\n● TC BioPharm (North America) Inc. – incorporated June 2021\nThese two subsidiaries have had limited operating activity since their incorporation. It is anticipated that TC BioPharm (North America) Inc. will develop operations\nand a management presence in the United States, with a view to expanding our product offerings into that jurisdiction in the future.\nThe corporate reorganization took place in several steps as follows:\n● On December 17, 2021, all shareholders in TC BioPharm Limited and holders of convertible loan notes in TC BioPharm Limited exchanged their shares and convertible\nloan notes for the same number and classes of newly issued shares and/or convertible loan notes in TC BioPharm (Holdings) Limited and, as a result, TC BioPharm\nLimited became a wholly owned subsidiary of TC BioPharm (Holdings) Limited.\n● On December 17, 2021, TC BioPharm (Holdings) Limited carried out a 10 for 1 forward split of all classes of its share capital.\n● On December 30, 2021, holders of various options to subscribe for shares in TC BioPharm Limited exchanged their options for equivalent options in TC BioPharm\n(Holdings) Limited.\n● On January 10, 2022, TC BioPharm (Holdings) Limited re-registered under the laws of Scotland as a public limited company, with a change of name to TC BioPharm\n(Holdings) plc.\n● Immediately prior to the completion of the initial public offering, the different classes and nominal values of issued share capital of TC BioPharm (Holdings) plc were\nreorganized into a single class of ordinary shares with the same nominal value. The ADSs represent a portion of these ordinary shares.\n● On February 10, 2022, TC BioPharm (Holdings) plc completed an initial public offering on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Our ADSs and warrants are traded under the\nsymbols TCBP and TCBPW respectively. Our ordinary shares are not listed. Our registered office in the United Kingdom is located at Maxim 1, 2 Parklands Way,\nHolytown, Motherwell, ML1 4WR, Scotland, United Kingdom, and the telephone of our registered office is +44 (0) 141 433 7557.\n4\nOn November 18, 2022 the Company undertook a reverse share split such that fifty issued ordinary shares were exchanged for one new ordinary share. As a result of\nthe share split, all references in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to units of ordinary shares or per share amounts are reflective of the reverse\nshare split for all periods presented. In addition, the exercise prices and the numbers of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of any outstanding options to purchase\nordinary shares were proportionally adjusted pursuant to the respective anti-dilution terms of the share-based payment plans.\nOn December 15, 2023 the Company changed its ratio of ADSs to one ADS representing one ordinary share to one ADS representing 20 ordinary shares. As a result of\nthe ratio change, all references to ADSs in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to units of ADSs or per ADS amounts are reflective of the ratio\nchange for all periods presented.

We have included our website address in this document solely as an inactive textual reference.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have taken a step-wise approach to clinical development and commercialization. To achieve this, we have made the clinical transition from autologous GD-Ts to\nallogeneic GD-Ts to CAR-modified allogeneic GD-Ts. Our commercialization strategy is to introduce products firstly in blood cancers (AML initially) and then solid tumor\nindications.\nOur strategic objective is to build a global therapeutic business with an extensive portfolio of GD-T cell-based products with the potential to significantly improve the\noutcomes of patients with cancer and infectious disease. In order to achieve our objective, we are focused on delivering success in the following areas:\nProgress unmodified GD-T2s into Phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of blood cancers\nHaving generated meaningful clinical data showing our product is well-tolerated in late-stage AML patients with no remaining treatment options, we commenced\nphase 2b-into pivotal (phase 3) clinical studies under the trial name ‘ACHIEVE’, with OmnImmune® during 2022 in AML patients who have failed to respond adequately to\ninduction therapy. The aim is to provide a form of salvage therapy which will either stabilize the patient, thereby preventing disease progression, or delay the requirement for\nhuman stem cell transplant. Our initial trial centers are in the UK and we are currently dosing patients in this trial. Working on the premise that other blood cancers should\nrespond to GD-Ts in a similar manner to AML, TCB plans to conduct clinical studies for OmnImmune® in other hematological malignancies in future.\nOmnImmune® clinical program\nOur OmnImmune® clinical program is an example of our stepwise approach to clinical development. The initial phase 1b/2a trials were undertaken using fresh cell-\nbased product under the program number TCB002. For ease of reference, when discussing that specific trial, we refer the program as OmnImmune® (TCB002). The phase 2b-\ninto pivotal (phase 3) clinical studies are using a frozen cell-based product under the program number TCB008-001. When discussing that specific trial, we refer the program as\nOmnImmune® (TCB008-001).\n5\nUnmodified GD-T2s for use in the treatment of infectious disease\nGamma-delta T cells are dysfunctional in patients with many severe viral diseases and TCB anticipates that its unmodified gamma delta T cell therapy platform will be\nused in due course to treat viral infections as well as cancers under the name ImmuniStim®. For example, during 2022 TCB developed a clinical trial protocol to treat patients\nwith COVID 19. Because of the progress of the disease and absence of appropriate trial patients this trial is not currently being progressed, although we expect to continue our\ninfectious disease program in future.\nProgress CAR-modified GD-Ts into Phase 1 clinical trials for treatment of solid tumors\nTCB aims to treat solid cancers using its patented co-stimulatory GD-T and is currently undergoing pre-clinical work to determine the most appropriate CAR construct\nand target indication.\nGrow our business operations to support the increasing number of clinical-phase products in development\nWe believe that our existing cell and gene manufacturing facility in the UK has the capacity to support our committed clinical development plans. We plan to continue\nto build upon this to support expansion of our product pipelines to new assets and to grow our clinical team. We also will work closely with vendors to embrace emerging\ntechnologies in our manufacturing operations that are appropriate and optimized for our products to continually improve the quality and efficiency of our manufacturing\nsystems. We believe that maintaining in-house control of these activities is critical to effective and efficient progression and we will continue to seek to build integrated business\nfunctions where possible.\nApply our discovery engine to target further diseases and add additional functionality to our products\nAs a platform technology, our co-stimulatory CAR-T GD-T cell system has a wealth of potential options to build added functionality into our cell-based platform. We\nplan to continue to innovate and partner in the field to augment our drug products and introduce next generation attributes. We also plan to continue to innovate our\nmanufacturing and supply chains to efficiently scale our processes and simplify the interface with patients and healthcare professionals, whilst continually seeking to reduce\nmanufacturing costs to improve patient access.\nExpand our intellectual property portfolio and acquire additional technologies to augment our strong IP position\nWe intend to continue building on our technology platform, comprised of intellectual property, proprietary methods and know-how in the field of GD-T cells. These\nassets form the foundation for our ability, not only to strengthen our product pipeline, but also to successfully defend and expand our position as a leader in the field of GD-T\nbased immune-oncology.\nOur Pipeline\nWhat are gamma delta T cells?\nThe immune system plays an important role in targeting and destroying cancer cells. One component has evolved to scan the body for diseased cells and eradicate\nthem. In humans, GD-Ts arise as a number of different subtypes, defined by the sequence of the gamma and delta chains of the T-cell receptor (TCR) on the cell surface. The\ngammadelta2 (GD-T2) subtype typically is the most abundant of these cells in healthy humans, and its TCR- of anti-cancer immunity is GD-T cells – a type of white blood cell\nthat express a variety of innate receptors, which mediated signaling has been fully characterized by researchers.\nVirally-infected or cancerous cells become stressed and accumulate cell surface phosphoantigens (isopentenyl pyrophosphate – IPP’s) which are recognized by GD-T2\ncells. Our proprietary technology platform includes the manufacturing of unmodified and genetically modified (CAR-T) GD-T cells as therapeutic candidates for use in clinical\ntrials and commercialization. Almost all aspects of the value-chain from product manufacture, quality systems, clinical and regulatory are operated in-house by TC BioPharm.\nWe believe this is one of our core competitive advantages, which we believe will contribute materially to our ability to overcome the challenging nature of developing new\nproducts.\nHuman lymphocytes comprise two groups of cells, B cells that generate antibodies for humoral immunity, and T cells that are responsible for cellular immune\nresponses. In healthy individuals, GD-T cells generally represent between 1% and 10% of peripheral blood T lymphocytes and present one of the first lines of defense against a\nwide range of bacterial and viral pathogens, as well as surveillance for cancerous cells. GD-T cells have the ability to regulate the initial immune response in several ways,\nincluding recruitment of other immune cells such as neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages through production of various chemokines (Kirby et al., 2007). Depletion of\nGD-T cells leads to impaired host defense to lung infections, for example (Moore et al., 2000; Lockhart et al., 2006). The predominant subset of GD-T cells in the blood is the\nGD-T2, which mediates a variety of immune responses by direct cytolysis of cancer cells and infected cells, development of memory phenotypes and modulation of other\nimmune cells. The gammadelta1 (GD-T1) is a functionally distinct subset of GD-T cells, which are a predominantly tissue resident population. GD-T1s are less well\ncharacterized, but their cytotoxic function also has been described in different liquid and solid tumors (Siegers & Lamb, 2014).\n6\nBoth subsets of GD-T cells are thought to play a role in autoimmune disorders such as celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune polyglandular syndrome and\nsarcoidosis where such lymphocytes are seen to accumulate in high numbers.\nGD-T cell killing a cancer cell.\n(1) A human GD-T (labelled ‘T’) identifies and scans (2) the surface of a cancer cell\n(labelled ‘C’). On contact with the cancer cell (3) the GD-T releases perforin granules\n(stained red) into the cancer cell, rupturing its membrane (4) destroying the cancer cell\n(adapted from – Enc Life Sci, Jul-2007).\nHow can GD-Ts be used to treat disease?\nCellular immunotherapy is a form of treatment that harnesses the cells of the immune system to combat disease and is one of the most actively pursued areas of\nresearch by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies today. Interest in immunotherapy is largely driven by recent compelling efficacy data in cancers and by the potential\nto achieve a cure or functional cure for some patients. While the field of immunotherapy in cancer, in general, has achieved proof of concept and yielded significant durable\nresponses in multiple tumor types, there remain major tumor types such as colon, breast, and prostate cancers as well as patient groups within responsive tumors, that do not\nrespond to current immunotherapy treatments. One theory to explain this non-responsiveness is that certain tumors require direct immune stimulation. T cell-based technologies\nseek to deliver activated T cells towards malignancies to initiate an immune response. The primary challenges in the field have been to couple an acceptable efficacy and safety\nprofile to successfully target solid tumors.\nAdoptive T cell transfer typically involves administration of autologous, allogeneic, or genetically-modified T cells (see footer below) into a recipient host with the\nspecific goal of boosting or transferring enhanced immunologic functionality. One of the most advanced cell-based approaches – chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells\n(CAR-T) – has gained momentum. In a recent study, patients with refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated with autologous genetically-modified T cells,\nwith almost 90% of patients showing a marked improvement (Pan et al., 2017). Although the treatment is showing promise for specific tumor types, the safety profile remains a\nconcern, as serious adverse events have previously been reported following CAR-T therapy (Grigor et al., 2017). As a consequence of safety issues related to this approach,\nregulatory approval may be more complex for this genetically modified T cell therapy which effectively has two ‘starting materials’ – (i) the cellular component, and (ii) a\nlentiviral vector. The therapeutic premise is well-established – T cells are transduced with a viral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor capable of recognizing cancer-\nspecific antigens, for example, CD19 which is commonly expressed on several tumors such as myeloma and B cell lymphomas. Transduction is the process by which DNA is\ntransferred from one cell to another by a virus; in this specific case DNA is introduced via a viral vector (a tool commonly used by molecular biologists to deliver genetic\nmaterial).\nFollowing transduction, the T cells are genetically primed to recognize and kill specific tumor cells expressing the target antigen. The process involves extracting a\npatient’s T cells (or growing an allogeneic T cell bank), transfecting the cells with a gene for a chimeric-antigen-receptor (CAR), and re-infusing transfected T cells into the\npatients. The use of cancer-specific cell therapies has gained momentum as several companies demonstrated that genetically modified CAR-T cells are efficacious when directed\nagainst blood tumors. These breakthrough findings have moved cell-based immunotherapy into the forefront of clinical oncology with two drugs now in the market.\nT lymphocytes have long been known to play an important role in cancer suppression and modulation of tumor growth and numerous experimental studies have\ndemonstrated the anti-cancer potential of GD-T lymphocytes. Indeed, GD-T cells can recognize a number of specific tumor-associated molecules including non-peptidic\nantigens (IPP’s – isopentenyl pyrophosphate) and immune surveillance stress signals (such as HSP60/70, MICA, MICB, and ULBP) present on the surface of transformed cells.\nThe GD-T cell overexpresses IL-2 receptors and this cytokine is necessary to activate them (Kjeldsen-Kragh, 1993). On recognizing a tumor cell, GD-T cells exert their anti-\ncancer properties via release of both perforin and of granzyme, a serine protease which enters the target cell to trigger cell death (apoptosis). Our research efforts are focused\nentirely on targeting tumors in ways that may result in an improved therapeutic index and that have potential applications in solid tumors as well as hematological malignancies.\nIn contrast to conventional AB CAR-T cells, our GD-T cell technology provides greater specificity in targeting tumors through recognition of IPP-expressing cells, whilst\navoiding on-target, off-tumor effects on healthy tissue lacking in IPPs.\n7\nLiquid cancers\nFor cell therapies to be effective several parameters need to be addressed. These include (i) viability, (ii) homing to the tumor, (iii) persistence at the tumor, and (iv)\ntarget-specificity.\nUse of unmodified GD-Ts to treat blood cancers addresses all the above factors. We believe that (i) we have demonstrated therapeutic cells remain viable when injected\ninto the bloodstream of cancer patients; (ii) our research shows GD-Ts injected into the bloodstream remain in-situ; and (iii) they persist for up to 100 days after administration.\nMoreover, we believe we have demonstrated that certain late-stage blood cancer patients treated with multiple GD-T doses have shown significantly positive responses. These\nfindings lead TCB to believe that all patients with similar blood cancers may respond to GD-T cell therapy in a positive manner.\nSolid cancers\nWe believe that it may be necessary to use CAR-T technology (i) to maximize therapeutic cell homing into the solid tumor site, and (ii) to increase GD-T cell\npersistence by ‘tethering’ the cell to antigens present on the cancer cell surface.\nIn order to overcome toxicities seen with conventional CAR-T approaches, we believe that we have developed a ‘co-stimulatory’ GD-T CAR which will only attack\nand kill cancerous cells whilst leaving healthy cells unharmed. This is important as many of the current conventional CAR-T therapies cannot distinguish target antigens\nexpressed on healthy cells from those on cancerous cells, which results in various pathologies, including cytokine release syndrome, that in some cases had led to patient death.\nSuch targeting of health cells with conventional CAR-T makes their use in solid cancers difficult, as too much healthy tissue is likely to be destroyed as ‘collateral’ damage in\nthe treatment process.\nThe diagram below illustrates how TCB’s approach works, using the innate receptors on the GD-T cell surface to act as a ‘safety switch’ – such receptors are generally not\ntriggered by healthy cells, only by disease markers (IPP’s) on the surface of cancerous or virally infected cells.\nA B\nCo-stimulatory CAR-T: A) No GD-T cell activation in healthy cell. B) GD-T activation and cell-killing in cancer cell.\nAutologous cells are derived from ‘self’, using patients own cells to treat their specific disease\nAllogeneic cells are derived from donor material, giving rise to cell banks able to treat numerous patients\nGenetically-modified cells are typically engineered with a ‘chimeric’ receptor to target specific cancer antigens\n8\nCommercialization of conventional CAR-T cell therapy has taken decades of high-quality research in academia and industry, and it has provided transformational\nresults for a number of patients with B cell malignancies. However, as noted, there are numerous barriers to widespread adoption, including:\n● Severe Toxicities. The significant risk of severe toxicities, especially cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity occurring up to 3 weeks from treatment. These\ntoxicities have resulted in the need for implementing specific clinical pathways to certify staff and facilities in the administration of the drugs and the management of the\ntoxicities.\n● On-target, off tumor toxicities. Conventional CAR-T products have no mechanism for discriminating between diseased and healthy cells. Activation is governed solely\nby the expression of the target antigen, which can lead to toxicity when the target antigen is expressed on healthy cells. In marketed products targeting CD19 (present in\nthe vast majority of B cells), this can be tolerated as B-cell aplasia, albeit with the need for regular long-term immunoglobulin replacement therapy. However, in\nexperimental CAR-T products targeting other antigens this has been shown to cause serious side-effects, up to and including fatality.\n● Complex supply chains associated with autologous treatments. By definition, autologous treatments require the source cells to have been collected from the patient. It\ntherefore requires a personalized supply chain with multiple touch points and the manufacturing process can only ever be performed on a single-patient batch size. This\nadds complexity to each treatment and has required the introduction of completely new processes and infrastructure in able to commercialize the products.\n● Inherent variability of the drug product. Each patient has a different cell population and so the starting material of each manufacturing batch is always variable, leading to\nvariable final product. This can be minimized during pre-screening, which eliminates some patients from treatment, but there are still significant challenges in\nmanufacturing to provide consistent batches of drug products and in understanding which variables are critical to product quality.\n● High list price of the products. The need for personalized manufacturing, new supply chain processes and management of acute and chronic toxicities have all\ncontributed to the high prices associated with the first CAR-T products reaching the market. In the USA, Kymriah® has a list price of $475,000 for pediatric ALL, and\nYescarta® lists at $373,000 for DLBCL patients. The associated treatment costs and ongoing management can increase this price significantly.\nThe combination of the co-stimulatory CAR, with GD-T cells, provides TCB with a proprietary platform which we believe addresses the problems with existing CAR-\nT products in the following ways:\n● Using the natural T cell signaling of the GD-T cell will, we believe, result in less risk of hyperactivation and tonic signaling with an overall reduction in the risk of CRS\nand less exhaustion of the cells.\n● The requirement on cell activation remains on the endogenous GD-T cell TCR signal, which detects stress signals associated with cancerous cells, so healthy cells are not\ntargeted for destruction even if the target antigen is expressed and the CAR binds, thus off-tumor toxicity is avoided.\n● Manufacturing in batches of high dose numbers, without the complex patient collection of personalized supply chain steps, we believe will result in a dramatic reduction\nin cost of goods. This will be reflected in a list price which is in line with current biologicals. With the reduced likelihood of associated toxicities, the treatment and\nmanagement costs should also be significantly lower, and the products can be made available to many more patients as a result.\n● The combination of a well-tolerated product and simplified supply chain (by virtue of our proprietary CryoTC freeze-thaw process), we believe, will make the therapy\nsuitable for administration in local oncology centers without patients having to locate in centralized specialist centers of excellence, further reducing financial and\nlogistic barriers to treatment.\n● The tolerance of “off tumor” antigen binding without associated toxicity allows for a complete change in the current target identification paradigm. Instead of identifying\ntargets that are exclusively expressed on tumor cells, we believe our co-stimulatory CAR-T approach confers an advantage to select targets that can be highly expressed\non tumors and at low levels on healthy tissue. We select targets based on their relative therapeutic index increase in expression, their homogeneity in tumors and the\nantigen density. This allows us to target significantly more tumor associated antigens and to significantly expand the therapeutic index into higher doses or repeat\nadministration.\n● GD-T cells have multiple roles in humans, possessing both innate and adaptive functions. One role is a sentinel surveillance cell, and they are biologically primed to\ntravel through tissue searching for sites of cellular stress. This ability to penetrate tissue makes them advantageous agents for treating solid tumors. We can add additional\nfunction to the GD-T cells by using one or more co-stimulatory CAR-T constructs to add targeting to appropriate antigen(s) and to provide armor or strategies to\novercome environmental and immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, we believe that the platform offers a promising approach to target the full\nspectrum of cancer diseases.\n9\nViral infections\nGD-Ts are natural killers of virally infected cells, as well as cancerous cells. We believe that our unmodified GD-T therapy offers substantial potential as a first line of\nattack against future viral pandemics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we took the opportunity to develop a trial protocol to treat patients with COVID-19, which was\napproved by the MHRA. We are currently not progressing this trial because of the absence of available patients given the progression of the disease; however we would consider\nconducting a phase 1b/2a trial if more severe/pathogenic variants emerge and we believe that there is considerable opportunity to deploy our GD-T therapy in the treatment of\nviral infections, including rapid response treatment of future epidemics and pandemics and selected acute viral infections. Whilst our current focus is to prioritize cancer\ntreatment we will seek opportunities to develop viral treatments either on our own or in partnership in future Numerous peer-reviewed publications have demonstrated that GD-\nT cells innate killers of cells which have become virally infected. Using Epstein-Barr virus infected cells as an exemplar, TCB has conducted pre-clinical studies to demonstrate\nthat our GMP-compliant manufacturing process results in GD-T with potent anti-viral cytotoxicity\nAutologous versus allogeneic\nCommercially available cell therapies typically are either autologous or allogeneic. Autologous products are taken from one donor (the patient) and used to treat that\nsame donor (self-to-self), whilst allogeneic products are usually taken from a single donor (not a patient) and used as the starting material to treat a large number of different\nindividuals (patients). GD-T lymphocytes are known to exert their biological effect in a non-MHC restricted manner. This means the potential for graft-versus-host mediated\nrejection is significantly reduced if allogeneic (non-self) cells are used as a treatment compared with many other immune cell therapies. As many patients with late-stage cancer\nor severe viral infections are also immunosuppressed, potential for host-mediated rejection of allogeneic cells is also reduced. When compared with autologous variants,\ncommercial benefits of allogenic treatment include the following:\n● significant reduction in cost of goods;\n● product can be campaign manufactured and stockpiled frozen;\n● increased capacity to treat more patients;\n● logistics of shipping product are simplified;\n● higher doses of (reproducible) product are possible; and\n● product is immediately available for acute disorders\nOur strategy for developing an allogeneic solution for CAR-T is to select a pathway which will allow us to bring our products to patients as quickly as possible. These\nconcepts build upon decades of previous development in allogeneic cell therapies and have clear understanding of development requirements in terms of manufacturing, clinical\nand regulatory execution.\nAlthough manufacture of allogeneic cell therapies allows product to be “pharmaceuticalized” by virtue of campaign manufacture and storage, the approach is however\nnot without technical and logistic challenges. To manufacture allogeneic banks, donor cells need to be screened for numerous adventitious agents, including for example, HIV,\nhepatitis, CMV and syphilis. Additional tumorgenicity testing is required, and assays conducted to ensure the cell bank is free from karyotypic aberrations. In order to overcome\nany potential for rejection, TCB has developed allogeneic GD-T cell banks that are unlikely to elicit a graft-versus-host (GvH) or host-versus-graft (HvG) immune response.\nDonors are screened and selected based on clinically-relevant history and then based on the proliferative capacity and phenotypic character of their GD-Ts, based on a\nsmall volume blood draw and in-house assays. In this way, only good quality GD-T cells are selected for repeat apheresis and banking. The banks are HLA-typed and become\nthe starting material for all of the allogeneic CAR-T products. These banks are cryopreserved in our facilities and can later be thawed, genetically engineered with the CAR,\nactivated and expanded into final product, before being frozen again as multiple individual doses of drug product.\nGeneration of Gamma Delta T cells from IPSC cells\nIdentification of appropriate donors whilst possible is challenging as only a limited number of batches can be created from a single donation. GD-T cells can be\nroutinely expanded from peripheral blood over 14 days. This provides a short window of opportunity for cell modification/engineering.\nInduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have the potential to overcome these issues because they are capable of unlimited proliferation and multidirectional\ndifferentiation. In 2013, several research groups from Japan reported the successful reprogramming of αβT-cells, followed by re-differentiation back to αβT cells (Vizcardo et\nal., 2013; Nishimura et al., 2013; Themeli et al., 2013). While re-differentiated αβT cells-maintained antigen specificity, they were also characterized by higher proliferation\nability than an original T-cell clone.\n10\nWe hypothesized that GD-T derived iPSCs cells that carry the rearrangements at the TCRG and TCRD gene locus will be able to generate GD-T but not αβT cells.\nFurthermore, iPSC cells will provide a vast opportunity for the gene-editing without any time constraints of terminally differentiated cells.\nReprogramming GD-T cells has proven to be a challenge, as these cells are not tolerant of cell sorting. Therefore, GD-T cells can be reprogrammed in a bulk culture\nwith the rest of peripheral blood cells or at the end of 14 days expansion, when the purity of GD-T is highest. After several unsuccessful reprogramming attempts, we have\noptimized the conditions favoring GD-T cells reprogramming. In the last round of reprogramming >50 clones were created. After extensive analysis of DNA rearrangements in\nδ- and γ-locus of 5 pre-selected clones, it was confirmed that they are derived from GD-T cells with different TCR sequences.\nIPSC technology is an attractive approach for the limitless source of GD-T cells are successful progress in reprogramming has been demonstrated. Further work is now\nrequired for the establishment of a GMP compatible T-cell differentiation protocol. Generation of GDT cells from iPSC cells presents TCB with a vast opportunity for scaling\nwithout any time constraints of terminally differentiated cells.\nFresh versus frozen product\nCommercial and clinical development of cellular therapy products will invariably require cryopreservation and frozen storage of cellular starting materials,\nintermediates and/or final product.\nOptimizing cryopreservation is important to obtaining maximum yield and a consistent end-product. Suboptimal cryopreservation can lead not only to batch-to-batch\nvariation, lowered cellular functionality and reduced cell yield, but also to the potential selection of subpopulations with genetic or epigenetic characteristics divergent from the\noriginal cell line.\nRegulatory requirements also impact on cryopreservation, requiring a robust and reproducible approach to freezing, storage and thawing of the product. This requires\nattention to all aspects of the application of low temperatures; from the choice of freezing container and cryoprotectant, the cooling rate employed and its mode of delivery,\ncorrect handling of the frozen material during storage and transportation, to eventual thawing of the product by the end-user. Each of these elements influences all of the others\nto a greater or lesser extent and have been taken into consideration as TCB moves from fresh to cryopreserved cell-based product.\nIn a submission to UK regulators, we provided batch manufacture and supporting data, and TCB was granted approval to commence treatment of cancer patients using\nfrozen allogeneic product. This represents a significant milestone for TCB, as we pioneer use of cryopreserved-donated cells to treat cancer. Obvious benefits include increased\nproduct reproducibility, ability to ship product globally on request and significant economy of scale (through batch manufacture and storage).\nClinical studies – unmodified GD-Ts in blood cancer\nManagement of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is based on intensive chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplant, but these therapies lead to high relapse rates amongst\ntreated patients. Particularly for the relapsed/refractory AML population or those who are not eligible for alloHSCT or intensive chemotherapy, the therapy options are limited,\nand patients are often placed in experimental protocol therapies or palliative care. As a result, there is a need for additional therapies, particularly for these cohorts.\nGD-T cells have emerged as a promising therapy due to their ability to specifically target cancer cells. Nonclinical studies performed in AML cell lines suggest that\nGD-T cells specifically target AML tumor cells and lead to cell lysis in vitro (Kirk et al., 1993). Additionally, in xenotransplantation animal models, GD-T cells obtained from\nhealthy volunteers specifically target AML cells and result in increased survival and diminished tumor burden in NOD mice (Gertner-Dardenne et al., 2012). Similarly, in vitro\nexperiments conducted by TCB further support such findings whilst providing evidence that OmnImmune® (TCB002) specifically targets stress induced cells and effectively\nkills AML cells lines.\nIn the clinic, allogeneic treatment in AML patients in the phase 1b/2a trial OmnImmune® (TCB002) has shown our product is well-tolerated with some preliminary\nevidence of anticancer activity. Firstly, there were no signs of graft vs. host disease (GvHD) following therapy and secondly, CR (complete response) and MLFS (morphologic\nleukemia free state) were observed. Earlier results with autologous product demonstrated good tolerability. For the allogeneic product, OmnImmune® (TCB002), additional\nprocedures were included to prevent GvHD (e.g. AB T cell depletion). Literature reports were also supportive of the use of OmnImmune® (TCB002) in cancer patients. The\nphase 1b/2a trial tested OmnImmune® (TCB002) in active relapsed or refractory AML who were not eligible for or did not consent to high dose salvage chemotherapy and/or\nallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). The trial was conducted to identify a tolerable dose and better understand the safety of this therapy in the chosen\nindication as well as generate preliminary information on potential clinical benefit. The primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints were as follows:\n11\nPrimary endpoints:\n● Assessment of adverse events (Aes) graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, vital signs and evaluation of laboratory\nparameters\n● Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 28 days after γδ T cell administration.\n● Establish Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of OmnImmune®\nSecondary endpoints:\n● Complete Remission (CR) rate\n● Overall survival (OS)\n● Quality of life determined by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire\nExploratory endpoints:\n● Changes in γδ T cell count and phenotype before and after OmnImmune® infusion\nNo formal statistical analysis was planned. The incidence of DLTs were to be summarized descriptively by γδ T cells dose for evaluable patients. The recommended\ndose would be determined as the greatest with an incidence of DLTs no greater than 1/3. All other data including efficacy results were summarized descriptively by γδ T cells\ndose.\nThe trial enrolled 8 patients and healthy donors aged >18 years.\nClinical outcome\nSeven patients were treated with OmnImmune® (TCB002). The eighth patient could not be dosed because the study was terminated as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, which prevented the importation of investigational product from Scotland to the Czech Republic. No safety concerns were raised during Safety Review Committee\n(SRC) meetings. No treatment related Serious Adverse Reactions (SARs) were reported in any of the patients who were enrolled in the trial. No grade 3≥ OmnImmune®\n(TCB002) treatment related toxicities were noted in any of the treated patients. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and no emergency safety measures have occurred for\nany subjects receiving OmnImmune® (TCB002). Two patients at 28 days post-treatment achieved a CR (one patient) or MLFS (one patient); another patient was classified as\nattaining stable disease with > 50% reduction in bone marrow blast count; one additional patient exhibited reduction in blast levels at 14 days; and one patient had disease\nprogression (see table below). One patient (PRA1-5003) died 21 days after TCB002 due to bilateral pneumonia, determined unrelated to study medication. One patient (PRA1-\n5010) was withdrawn because of the COVD-19 pandemic before bone marrow aspiration on day 28 post-treatment. These preliminary indications of anticancer activity were not\nexpected given the refractory profile of the enrolled patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire resulted in scoring from six of the seven patients dosed with OmnImmune® (TCB002) for varying periods of time depending on\ntheir study duration. At 7 days post dosing, the average QoL score from six patients had decreased from 55.7 to 47.2 out of a possible maximum of 100. This negative impact on\nQoL reflects the well characterized side effects of preconditioning therapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine given between 6 and 2 days prior to OmnImmune®\n(TCB002) administration. The score remained lower in the four patients assessed at 28 days at a level of 50.0. In the two patients (one CR and one MLFS) who were assessed at\nthe end of the study (week 24), both had recovered to an improved QoL score, each of 67.0.\n12\nFDA Orphan Drug Designation\nAbout 60 million people living in the European Union (EU) and USA suffer from a rare disease. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and FDA play a central role\nin facilitating the development and authorization of medicines for rare diseases, which are termed ‘orphan medicines’ in the medical world. Developing medicines intended for\nsmall numbers of patients has little commercial incentive under normal market conditions. Therefore, the EU and USA offer a range of incentives to encourage the development\nof designated orphan medicines.\nThe general therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AML has not changed substantially over the past 30 years. Excluding APL (which should be treated with trans-\nretinoic acid), AML management is based primarily on induction, incorporating an anthracycline and cytarabine, and consolidation therapy, and/or allogeneic Hematopoietic\nStem Cell Transplantation (alloHSCT). Induction/consolidation therapy leads to high CRs rates in those who are eligible for treatment and present a favorable risk profile.\nSeveral novel agents are in various stages of development for the treatment of AML. Novel approaches include antibody-based immunotherapy and adoptive cell\ntherapy that aim to improve anti-leukemia T cell function, such as the therapies developed by TCB (OmnImmune®).\nOmnImmune® (TCB002) was initially studied in patients with active relapsed or refractory AML who are not eligible or do not consent to high dose salvage\nchemotherapy and/or alloHSCT. In July 2019, OmnImmune® (TCB002) was granted ‘orphan medicine’ status from the FDA for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). TCB\nintends to conduct a further clinical phase 2/3 study (OmnImmune® (TCB008-001)) in 2021/2 aimed at treating earlier stage AML patients.\nSummary of TCB’s phase 1b/2a clinical trial in patients with fourth-line-of-treatment acute myeloid leukemia. Subsequent to the completion of this study TCB\ncommenced phase 2b into 3 (pivotal) patient treatment during H1, 2022.\nPipeline and plan\nOur future pipeline is focused on treating liquid cancers with our unmodified GD-T therapies and the treatment of solid cancers with next-generation allogeneic GD-T\nCAR-T therapies.\nOur unmodified cell therapy, used in the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, is supplied under the name OmnImmune.\n13\nOmnImmune® is an allogeneic unmodified GD-T (GD-T2) cell product. Donor-derived GD-T cells for proliferative capacity, were activated and expanded in our\nmanufacturing facility before being infused into the patient as part of our OmnImmune® (TCB002) phase 1 trial. This trial was completed in H1 2020 at the Institute of\nHematology and Blood Transfusion in Prague, Czech Republic. Having generated meaningful clinical data showing our product is well-tolerated in late-stage AML patients\nwith no remaining treatment options, TCB commenced a phase 2b-into pivotal (phase 3) clinical studies (with OmnImmune®) during 2022 in AML patients who have failed to\nrespond adequately to induction therapy. The aim is to provide a form of salvage therapy which will either stabilize the patient, thereby preventing disease progression, or delay\nthe requirement for human stem cell transplant. Our initial trial centers are in the UK. Working on the premise that other blood cancers should respond to GD-Ts in a similar\nmanner to AML, TCB plans to conduct clinical studies for OmnImmune® in other hematological malignancies in future. The initial phase 1b/2a trials were undertaken using\nfresh cell-based product under the program number TCB002. For ease of reference, when discussing that specific trial, we refer the program as OmnImmune® (TCB002). The\nsubsequent planned phase 2b-into pivotal (phase 3) clinical studies uses a frozen cell-based product under the program number TCB008-001. When discussing that specific trial,\nwe refer the program as OmnImmune®.\nWe plan to develop a range of allogeneic co-stimulatory GD-T CAR pre-clinical drug candidates which will target antigens expressed on a number of solid tumor\ntypes.\nTCB has generated in-vitro preclinical data as part of our CAR-T program which demonstrated that GD-Ts are very high purity and can be CAR-transduced with high efficiency\n(see diagram below). Gamma delta cell purity and transduction efficiency have been measured using flow cytometry. CAR positive cells were measured by a detection reagent\nlabelled with the fluorophore Phycoerythrin (PE). Flow cytometry analysis used the parameters of side scatter height (SSC-H) and PE area (PE-A) to define the cell populations.\nThis is demonstrated in the figure below comparing non-transduced (NTD) and transduction with a co-stimulatory CAR construct (co-stim CAR).\nWe have also demonstrated that following transduction with different CAR constructs, GD-T’s can be effectively and reproducibly expanded in-vitro whilst exhibiting\nincreased cytotoxicity in a zoledronate-dependent manner (see diagrams below – zoledronate-dependency reflects TCB’s proprietary process for commercial expansion of GD-\nT’s). The CAR constructs contained different endodomains including DNAX-activating protein 10 (DAP-10) and the high affinity IgE receptor (FcR) with no endodomain (no-\nendo) and non-transduced (NTD) as controls. These data outline the key preclinical parameters investigated in advance of progressing our CAR-T products into clinical trials.\nTCB has engaged with UK regulators to discuss the design of GD-T CAR phase1b/2a clinical studies (specifically relating to patient dosing and quality systems).\n14\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were initiated into culture and GD-T cells expansion stimulated by zoledronic acid. On day 2 of expansion, cells were\ntransduced with lentiviral vectors (LVV) to deliver the indicated CAR constructs. After routine feeding through the expansion process, cells were harvested on day 14 and the\ntotal cell number, fold expansion and viability of GD-T cells evaluated. Data present a compilation of experiments across multiple individual donors (N=9; n=1-5).\nManufacturing\nUnlike many pre-clinical and early clinical stage biotech companies that rely on outsourcing key manufacturing and development functions with consequent complex\nand expensive supply chains and delays in delivery and execution, we have built a world-class fully integrated GMP grade specialist GD-T manufacturing center in Glasgow,\nScotland. This facility undertakes all key functions associated with our GD-T cell development, testing, quality assurance, product manufacture, clinical trial recruitment,\nmanagement design, support and interaction with regulators. This has resulted in rapid, focused development; highly efficient cost control;, controlled supply chain; speed of\ndevelopment and clinical delivery. We employ over 80 highly qualified people at our facility. The inspiration to create a fully integrated facility came from our founders’ vision\nand considerable experience in cell therapy.\nAll advanced therapy medicinal products in the UK must be manufactured by law under a manufacturer’s license granted by the MHRA. TCB received its\nManufacturer’s Authorisation for Investigational Medicinal Products MIA (IMP) from the MHRA in January 2015 (license number MIA (IMP) 42803). In April 2016, the\nMHRA granted the ‘Specials’ license to TCB as well as approving the facility for ongoing GMP compliance, which permits the manufacture and release of Advanced Therapy\nMedicinal Products (ATMPs) for use in clinical trials.\nThe backbone of our company is TCB’s Quality Management System, which TCB based on the principles of the current GMP as described in the ‘Rules and Guidance\nfor Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Distributors’ and EudraLex Volume 4 as revised. This is achieved by the application of a Quality Management System based around the\nrequirements of ICH Q10 and the EU GMP Guide, which address factors affecting the desired quality, namely the personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, processes,\nprocedures training, vendor selection and approval, User Requirement Specification (URS) qualification and validation of assays and systems and the record keeping. All\npersonnel joining TCB undergo rigorous training on everything from GMP through to formalized systems for measuring and evaluating risk.\n15\n*MHRA approved GMP compliant (last inspection December 2020 – observations only)\nTCB’s manufacturing facilities are equipped with two Class B clean rooms with space secured for future expansion for production of our products as it progresses\nfrom phase I to phase III clinical trials. The facility is also equipped with Development and Quality control testing laboratories together and ample stores for goods inwards and\nproduct release plus storage for intermediate and final product. Equipment is controlled and monitored through a Management Information System with 24/7 monitoring. All\nlaboratory equipment undergoes a formal URS and once installed undergoes full qualification prior to it being put into routine use.\nTCB’s Quality Control team are responsible for the majority of release testing for our products. The Quality Control departments (analytical and microbiology) are\nresponsible for product characterization using bespoke phenotyping and potency assays, safety testing assays and final release of the product to the clinic. In-house testing within\nTCB’s Quality Control laboratories eliminates the necessity for third party involvement, resulting in reduced costs and gaining full control of scheduling. The Quality Control\ndepartments remit also extends to the microbiological monitoring of the facility to measure, assess and control the exceptionally high levels of sterility required within the\naseptic manufacturing suites. Extensively equipped Quality Control microbial laboratories allow environmental monitoring of the manufacturing cleanrooms to GMP standards.\nThe laboratories house incubators, biological safety cabinets, centrifuges, fridges, freezers, air and particle monitors.\nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary\nproducts. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from\nmany different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and\nprivate research institutions. Any GD-T cell therapeutic candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that\nmay become available in the future. We believe our advanced clinical products in allogeneic and unmodified GD-Ts provide us a first mover advantage in oncology and viral\nindications. Our continued efforts in advancing our modified platform technologies, along with our efforts in banked GD-Ts, are in direct competition with a number of public\nand private companies in the cell therapy space.\nTC BioPharm is part of a growing number of companies commercially active in the cellular immunotherapy space. Such companies developing call-based products\ninclude AdicetBio who presented phase 1 data from patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma using allogeneic GDT-1’s modified with a CAR against CD20 – published initial\nresults documented safety and CR/PR in some patients. Other companies include Allogene who are using various CAR-modified allogeneic alpha-beta cells to treat non-\nHodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia and renal cell carcinoma; Autolus who are conducting clinical studies using autologous alpha-beta T cells using\nCAR’s directed against either CD19/22 or CD20, listed indications include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia;\nand In8Bio who have several ongoing phase 1 and 2 clinical programs including an autologous DRI resistant to alkylating agents for treating glioblastoma and an allogeneic\nproduct for treating patients with acute leukemia, In8Bio also have a bespoke GDT therapy for AML derived from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Apart from TCB\nwho manufacture cell-based product in-house, we believe the above companies contract-out GMP formulation of clinical product to third-party organizations.\n16\nCommercial leaders in the CAR-T space are Novartis AG (Basel, Switzerland) and Gilead (Foster City, CA). Both of these companies market autologous CD19-\ntargeted AB CAR-T products. Bristol Myers Squibb (New York, NY) has obtained approval for its CD19-directed CAR-T. Via third party collaborations, all three of the\ncommercial leaders in autologous CAR-T, have accessed gene editing technology with a view to creating allogeneic products. Novartis have partnered with Intellia (Cambridge,\nMA), Gilead have an agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics (Richmond, CA) and Bristol Myers Squibb have an agreement with Editas Medicine (Cambridge, MA).\nWe do not believe that any of these competitors will offer the same commercial proposition as our GD-T cell therapeutic candidates due to our:\n● Ownership of foundation IP of the co-stimulatory CAR technology within GD-Ts.\n● First-mover advantage in the field of modified GD-Ts as therapeutics.\n● Ability to GMP manufacture large numbers of modified GD-T cells to a high purity in a cost-effective manner.\n● Established banks of allogeneic products which may be used in future (following appropriate regulatory approvals) to treat both cancer and severe viral disease.\n● The potential to create CAR-T therapies with significantly improved safety profile, suitable for widespread market adoption.\n● Experience of, and in-house management of, our clinical trial programs.\n● Pipeline development strategy and screening tools to develop a deep pipeline of platform products for a range of diseases.\nOur Strengths\nOur clinical trials have provided very strong evidence of drug-toleration and some preliminary evidence of clinical benefit.\nOur clinical trial of TCB001 involved treatment of patients with autologous unmodified GD-Ts. In a phase 1b/2a dose-ranging safety study (maximum total dose\n30x109 cells) we saw no evidence of drug-related severe adverse events. A total of eight patients were treated with escalating doses of TCB001, and no treatment-related\ntoxicities were reported during the full six-week therapeutic course. Data from OmnImmune® (TCB002) suggests an excellent tolerability, with no observed Host versus Graft\nDisease (HvGD) and some preliminary indication of clinical benefit. OmnImmune® (TCB002) has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA.\nOur CAR-T platform is centered on development of safer and more widely applicable therapeutic candidates and associated process and manufacturing capabilities.\nOur proprietary co-stimulatory CAR-T technology platform covers identification of target cancer antigens, successful design and engineering of target sequences,\npreclinical safety testing and optimized manufacturing processes suitable for producing therapeutic candidates for use in clinical trials and commercialization. We believe the\nplatform will enable development of additional GD-T cell therapeutic candidates targeting cancers that have previously been difficult to treat. We believe the products will be\ndemonstrably safer than the current generation of AB T cell CAR-T products because they will not attack healthy non-cancerous cells and augment the natural biological\nprocess rather than bypassing it.\nWe have identified a large and growing pool of cancer targets for which we can develop additional therapeutic candidates.\nWe have identified over 20 antigens that are preferentially expressed in cancer cells and have established ongoing research programs to develop several of these into\nour GD-T platform. Within the terms of our agreement, bluebird bio, we have first right of refusal on a further three oncology targets. Each antigen target presents an\nopportunity to target many cancer types and therefore presents multiple potential represents a development, collaboration and/or an out-licensing opportunity as each target\ncould be used to target specific cancer types. Growing the pipeline of products built on our co-stimulatory CAR-T and reaching patients is our priority.\nWe have historically entered collaborative arrangements with partners (bluebird bio, Inc (now 2seventybio). (USA) and Nipro Corporation (Japan), which involve\nfunded or partly funded preclinical collaboration. It is uncertain at this time whether TCB will receive any significant revenues from these collaborations.\n17\nWe retain control of key business elements, such as product manufacture and clinical research.\nWhilst many companies contract out product manufacture, quality systems and clinical trial management, we have elected to build these skills in-house. TC BioPharm\nhas a GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) cleanroom facility where our products are manufactured. We also retain all the quality support systems such as product testing and\nrelease of final product to the clinic. Keeping these systems in-house allows the Company to control all aspects of the manufacturing process whilst significantly reducing costs\nof goods (CoGs). Further saving on costs are accrued by in-house manufacture, as contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) will typically charge several times more than\nthe actual costs to maintain their profit margins. Rather than fully outsource our clinical trial management, data management and pharmacovigilance, we maintain an inhouse\nclinical team that partners with a contract clinical research organization (CRO) for data management and pharmacovigilance services. The inhouse clinical team conducts and\nmanages our own clinical trials in-house. In addition to significant cost savings, this allows us to build a strong working relationship with physicians who are treating the cancer\npatients; we believe this is key to successful product development as the physicians participating in our clinical studies will also be our future customers. We believe that\nretaining control of key elements of our business such as GMP manufacture and clinical operations, has allowed TC BioPharm to move quickly and efficiently since\nincorporation.\nWe continue to file new patent applications from new in-house product development, and have a strong growing intellectual property portfolio to protect our products\nand proprietary platform.\nWe have a strong intellectual property portfolio covering the key aspects of our manufacturing processes and product platforms. Our in-house product development\nteam are dedicated to developing new therapeutic candidates and optimizing current manufacturing processes. All of our patent families are currently in various stages of the\npatent approval process, and as leaders in the path towards the commercialization of GD-Ts we hold significant first-mover advantage captured by trade secrets and know-how.\nOur policy of developing strategic alliances has and will provide additional support for product development and commercialization.\nWe believe that strategic alliances, both historic and potential future alliances, have and will provide extensive experience in scale-up and automation, culture media\nmanufacture and post-authorization sales and marketing with regional expertise. Additionally, we expect to use knowledge gained from our collaborations to improve\ndevelopment pathways for our unpartnered CAR-T therapeutic candidate programs.\nWe have a highly knowledgeable and experienced management team with extensive industry experience and expertise in the United States and in Europe.\nMr. Kobel joined us as our Chief Executive Officer at the time of our IPO. Bryan brings a US presence to our executive team and over 15 years’ experience in\nHealthcare and Life Sciences capital markets. Martin Thorp, our Chief Financial Officer has over 40 years’ experience in implementing capital strategies globally from seed\ninvestment to IPO. He was global CEO of Arthur Andersen Corporate Finance based in New York.\nAbility to treat patients under the ‘Specials’ regulatory framework.\nEuropean regulations (Regulation 167 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012) set out the exemption from the requirement for a medicinal product, placed on the\nmarket in the UK to hold a marketing authorization. This exemption flows from Article 5(1) of EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which states that a member of the EU may, in\naccordance with legislation in force and to fulfil special needs, excludes from the provisions of this Directive medicinal products supplied in response to a bona fide unsolicited\norder, formulated in accordance with the specifications of an authorized healthcare professional and for use by an individual patient under his or her direct personal\nresponsibility. Such an unlicensed medicinal product may only be supplied in order to meet the special needs of an individual patient. An unlicensed medicinal product should\nnot be supplied where an equivalent licensed medicinal product can meet the special needs of the patient. Responsibility for deciding whether an individual patient has “special\nneeds” which a licensed product cannot meet should be a matter for the doctor, dentist, nurse independent prescriber, pharmacist independent prescriber or supplementary\nprescriber responsible for the patient’s care.\nIn terms of time and cost, the ‘Specials’ scheme is an attractive strategy. We believe that accumulating evidence by this route could lead to rapid and wider product\nuptake through ‘off-label’ use.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have a strong portfolio of patents covering manufacture and commercialization of GD-T cell products and their modification via CAR-T (summarized below). Our\ntechnology platform and clinical programs have enabled us to raise over $100 million in grant, equity and collaboration funding since becoming operational in 2017. This\nfinancing has allowed us to enhance and expand our clinical and preclinical programs as well as build our team of world-class scientists.\n18\nThe following table provides an overview of our core technology platforms, technology assets and competencies across the business. Additional details of our\nintellectual property portfolio are provided below.\nASSET SUMMARY ATTRIBUTES\nGD-T Vehicle ● Readily available and expanded to high numbers.\n● Not MHC-restricted, therefore no graft vs host disease – an allogeneic platform.\n● Pre-programmed tropism for infiltration of diseased tissue.\n● Multiple modes of innate cytotoxicity and coordinating a wider immune response.\n● Clinical tolerability of the allogeneic vehicle demonstrated at high dose level.\n● Naturally arising in different subtypes offering a menu of vehicles with unique properties.\nAllogeneic Cell Banks ● Donor GD-Ts selection based on highest therapeutic quality.\n● Reproducible product with low cost-of-goods compared with autologous (patient-bespoke) therapies, can be frozen-\nshipped, thawed at clinic.\n● Well understood clinical and regulatory pathway to commercialization.\nCo-stimulatory CAR-T ● Elimination of off-tumor toxicity.\n● Reduction of cytokine release from killing healthy cells.\n● Reliance on natural T cell activation and no tonic signaling\n● Antigen expression on healthy tissue tolerated – greatly expanded range.\n● Ability to use multiple co-stimulatory receptors to add functionality.\nIntegrated Business Model ● Full control of critical stages of development projects, which increases speed and reliability of development and\nproduction, optimizes operations to our specialized products and materially reduces our cost base\n● No pass-through or transaction costs form external service providers, which increases efficiency and speed of\ndevelopment and manufacturing and materially reduces our cost base\n● In-house clinical management ensures best chance of clinical success and avoids use of very expensive clinical\nmanagement in early-stage trials, materially reducing our cost base.\nThe strength of our patents involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain.\nWe actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, enforcing\nand defending patent rights for our therapeutics and processes, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and\nmaintain patent and other protection including data/market exclusivity for our therapeutic products and platform technology, preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and\noperate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.\nOur policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position generally by filing an initial priority filing at the U.K. Intellectual Property Office, or UKIPO. This is followed\nby the filing of a patent application under the Patent Co-operation Treaty claiming priority from the initial application(s) and then progressing to national applications in, for\nexample, the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, China and Canada. In each case, we determine the strategy and territories required after discussion with our\npatent professionals to ensure that we obtain relevant coverage in territories that are commercially important to us and our GD-T therapeutic candidates. We will additionally\nrely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available, including as relevant exclusivity through orphan or pediatric drug designations. We also\nrely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our underlying platform technology and therapeutic products. Prior to making any decision on filing any patent application, we\nconsider, with our patent professionals, whether patent protection is the most sensible strategy for protecting the invention concerned or whether the invention should be\nmaintained as confidential.\nAs of March 22, 2024, we own 16 granted patents and 11 patent applications in 3 families, and have an exclusive license to an additional 1 family of 14 granted patents\nand 8 patent applications. Consistent with the filing strategy outlined above, all of our applications are either UK applications, PCT applications or national phase applications\nderived from a corresponding PCT application. All sets of national phase applications include a US application / patent. These patents and patent applications include claims\ndirected to our therapeutic products and platform technology or other manufacturing and process technology to further enable our therapeutic products and manufacturing\nmethods.\nWO 2016/166544 (Modified Gamma Delta T Cells and uses thereof). International filing date April 14, 2016, earliest priority date April 15, 2015.\n19\nWe own patents and patent applications covering a method of treatment for cancer using GD-T cells that express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). The patent\napplication claims are directed to GD-T cells expressing a co-stimulatory CAR, the advantages of the co-stimulatory CAR by inhibiting on-target, off-tumor activation due to its\ndesign, to the method and process of modifying a GD-T cell to express the co-stimulatory CAR, and to medical uses of the modified GD-T cell. A US patent application has\nissued as a granted patent in the US (US 10881688 B2, expires October 7, 2036 in view of USPTO calculated Patent Term Adjustment (PTA)). Applications have been granted\nin Australia (AU 2016250211), China (ZL 201680034862.3) Israel (IL 255011), and Japan (JP 6995624) and at the Eurasian Patent Office. National applications remain\npending in: Australia, Hong Kong, and the US. A regional patent application is pending before the European Patent Office.\nWO 2016/174461 (T cell which expresses a Gamma Delta T cell receptor and a Chimeric Antigen Receptor). International filing date April 29, 2016, earliest priority\ndate April 30, 2015. Expiry date will be April 28, 2036 in most jurisdictions. Further patent term adjustments may apply in the US.\nWe are the exclusive licensee of patents and patent applications owned by UCL Business plc covering a method of treatment using a T cell which expresses a Gamma\nDelta T cell receptor and a chimeric antigen receptor. The patent application claims are directed to GD-T cells expressing a co-stimulatory CAR, the advantages of the co-\nstimulatory CAR by inhibiting on-target, off-tumor activation due to its design, to the method and process of modifying a GD-T cell to express the co-stimulatory CAR, and to\nmedical uses of the modified GD-T cell. National applications have been granted in Australia (AU 2016255611, expires April 28, 2036), Canada (CA2982532), Japan (JP\n6986449), Israel (IL 255186), South Africa (ZA 2017/06923), and via the Eurasian regional patent (EA 041081) in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan,\nRussia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan. Additional national applications are pending in: Brazil, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, and the US. A regional\npatent application is pending before the European Patent Office.\nWO 2016/005752 (Gamma Delta T cells and uses thereof). International filing date July 8, 2015, earliest priority date July 9, 2014. Expiry date for the patent granted\nin Israel will be July 7, 2035.\nWe own an Israeli patent and Japanese patent applications covering the method of preparing and using GD-T cells in the allogeneic treatment of subjects suffering\nfrom viral infection, fungal infection, protozoal infection or cancer. The patent application claims are directed to the process of providing GD-T cells from a first subject to a\nsecond subject (allogeneic transfer).\nWO 2019/064030 (Modified CAR-T). International filing date October 1, 2018, earliest priority date September 29, 2017.\nWe own a US Patent (US11890302) and patent applications covering chimeric antigen receptors comprising an intracellular signaling domain derived from GD-T cell\nsurface receptors. When expressed in GD or natural killer (NK) cells, the resultant CAR-T cells exhibit improved cytotoxicity. National applications are pending in: Hong Kong,\nIsrael, Japan, and South Korea,. A regional patent application is pending before the European Patent Offices.\nPlatform technology patent applications – We have several other patent applications in the process of being drafted, improving T cell efficacy by modulating PD1\nexpression, additional methods of expanding GD-T1 gamma-delta T cell populations and improvements to our GD CAR-T platform\nGovernment Regulation and Product Approval\nAs a biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our product candidates, if approved, will be regulated as biological medicines. With this\nclassification, commercial production of our products will need to occur in registered and licensed facilities in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or\ncGMPs, for biologics.\nHuman immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. The FDA categorizes human cell- or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or\nmore than minimally manipulated and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the\nsubmission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing authorization.\nGovernment authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively\nregulate, among other things, the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion,\nadvertising, sale, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our\nproduct candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may\nbe legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United\nStates, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific\nregulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and\nforeign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.\n20\nUnited States Product Development Process\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA,\nand implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the\nsubsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to\ncomply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to\nadministrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold,\nwarning letters and similar public notice of alleged non-compliance with laws, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of\nproduction or distribution, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action\ncould have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be approved for marketing in the United States generally involves\nthe following:\n● completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of\nlaboratory animals or other applicable regulations;\n● submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;\n● performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, and\nany additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological\nproduct for its intended use;\n● preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and\npotency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;\n● satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with\ncGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls used in product manufacture are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and\npurity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current Good Tissue Practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;\n● potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;\n● payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA; and\n● FDA acceptance, review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, which might include review by an advisory committee, a panel typically consisting of independent\nclinicians and other experts who provide recommendations as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.\nBefore testing any biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing.\nPreclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the\nproduct candidate. After sufficient preclinical testing has been conducted, the conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including\nGLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA before clinical testing can begin in the United States. An IND must contain the results of the preclinical tests,\nmanufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, a proposed clinical protocol, an investigator’s brochure, a sample informed consent form,\nand other materials. Clinical trial protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the\nparameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any\namendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing, such as toxicity studies, may continue even after the IND is submitted.\nThe IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials or places\nthe trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.\nThe FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA\nimposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that\nsubmission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.\n21\nFurther, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical\ntrial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in\nthe clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed\nby each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid\nmolecules also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted\nat that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally\nphysicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP\nrequirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent.\nHuman clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:\n● Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening\ndiseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients\nwith the target disease or condition.\n● Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of\nthe product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.\n● Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically\ndispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to\nestablish the overall risk to benefit profile of the product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling.\nPhase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.\nPost-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain\nadditional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.\nDuring all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial\ninvestigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the\nFDA, and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant\nrisk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The\nsponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the\nFDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. The FDA or the\nsponsor or its data safety monitoring board, an independent group of experts that evaluates study data for safety and makes recommendations concerning continuation,\nmodification, or termination of clinical trials, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being\nexposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immunotherapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical\ntrial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected\nserious harm to patients.\nBecause this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of\npatients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy products, or that the data generated in\nthese trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.\nConcurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional nonclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical\ncharacteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help\nreduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose\nattributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things,\nthe sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be\nselected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\n22\nUnited States Review and Approval Processes\nAfter the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The\nBLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed\nlabeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA\nfor filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all as the FDA has significant discretion to approve or reject the BLA and to require\nadditional preclinical or clinical studies.\nUnder the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees\non an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a\nwaiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless\nthe product also includes a non-orphan indication.\nWithin 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for\nfiling. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event,\nthe BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is\naccepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is\nsafe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and\npreserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present\ndifficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to\nwhether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such\nrecommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation\nStrategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the biological product, which could include medication\nguides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. FDA\ndetermines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA\nmust submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.\nBefore approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the\nmanufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.\nFor immunotherapy products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA\nregulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue\nbased products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP\nrequirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable\ndisease. FDA GTP regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and\ntesting. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND\ntrial requirements and GCP requirements.\nTo assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, recordkeeping,\nproduction, and quality control.\nNotwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and\ndeny approval. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its then current form, the FDA will issue a Complete Response Letter, which generally outlines the specific\ndeficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of\nthe application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Even with the\nsubmission of additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If a Complete Response Letter is\nissued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.\nIf a product receives regulatory approval, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the application.\n23\nFurther, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval.\nIn addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and\neffectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, many types of changes to the\napproved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and\napproval.\nIn addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product\nfor the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and\neffective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.\nUnited States Post-Approval Requirements\nAny products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements,\nreporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and\ncomplying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for\nuses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational\nactivities, and requirements that important safety information and material facts related to the product be disclosed. Although physicians may prescribe legally available\nproducts for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. The\nFDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-\nlabel uses may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative liability.\nIn addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term\nstability of the product. We currently are making clinical trial product in our own facilities in Scotland, United Kingdom. In the future, however, we expect to rely, on third\nparties for the production of commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and\nquality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP.\nManufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state\nagencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers\nmust continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after\napproval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the\nmarket.\nThe FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously\nunknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, with manufacturing processes, or the failure to comply with applicable FDA\nrequirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, complete withdrawal from the market, product recalls,\nwarning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, product seizure or detention, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties, among\nothers. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and\ncontraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new\nlegislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.\nUnited States Marketing Exclusivity\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known\nas biosimilars. Biosimilars are approved pursuant to an abbreviated pathway whereby applicants need not submit the full slate of preclinical and clinical data, and approval is\nbased in part on the FDA’s findings of safety, purity, and potency for the original biologic (i.e., the reference product). Original BLAs are eligible to receive 12 years of\nexclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, which prevents the FDA from approving any biosimilars to the reference product through the abbreviated pathway,\nbut does not prevent approval of BLAs that are accompanied by a full data package and that do not rely on the reference product. A biosimilar may be approved if the product is\nhighly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and there are no clinically meaningful differences with the reference\nproduct in terms of the safety, purity, and potency.\nPediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity\nperiods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion\nof a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.\n24\nUnited States Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and\nmarkets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in significant part, on the extent to which third-party\npayors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payers include federal and state healthcare programs,\nprivate managed care organizations, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a product may be\nseparate from the process of establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an\napproved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging\nthe price, examining the medical necessity of and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and\nefficacy.\nReimbursement may impact the demand for, and/or the price of, any product candidate which obtains marketing approval. Even if coverage and reimbursement is\nobtained for a given product candidate by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find\nunacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to\nreimburse all or part of the costs associated with those medications. Patients are unlikely to use a product, and physicians may be less likely to prescribe a product, unless\ncoverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of the product. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to\nnew drug product acceptance.\nDifferent pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and\nreimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative\nlist systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries\nmay require the completion of additional clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states\nallow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets\nexert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.\nThe downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics, has become very intense. Governments have shown significant\ninterest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. As a result,\nincreasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial\nsale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has\nincreased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if\nfavorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement\nrates may be implemented in the future.\nUnited States Healthcare Laws Governing Interactions with Healthcare Providers\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain\nmarketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding\npayments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.\nThe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving\nremuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any\nhealthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been\nbroadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and\nprescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common\nactivities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that are alleged to be\nintended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the\nrequirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\nInstead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted\nthe statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the U.S.\nfederal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard\nsuch that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA\ncodified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes\nof the U.S. federal False Claims Act.\n25\nFederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the U.S. federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil\nwhistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the\nfederal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been\nprosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare\nand Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In\naddition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Further, pharmaceutical manufacturers can be held liable under the U.S.\nfederal False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims.\nThe U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions,\nknowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third- party payors, knowingly and willfully\nembezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying,\nconcealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits,\nitems or services. Like the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no\nlonger needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose certain\nrequirements on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective “business associates” that\ncreate, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, and their covered subcontractors, relating to the privacy,\nsecurity, transmission and breach of individually identifiable health information. Further, HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to\nmake civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S.\nfederal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.\nAdditionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices,\nbiologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually\nreport to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include\ndoctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and\nteaching hospitals as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers\nalso will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified\nnurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives.\nAdditionally, similar healthcare laws and regulations in the European Union and other jurisdictions, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and\npayments to healthcare providers and laws governing the privacy and security of certain protected information, such as GDPR, which imposes obligations and restrictions on the\ncollection and use of personal data relating to individuals located in the European Union (including health data).\nFinally, the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and\nservices reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply\nwith the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug\nmanufacturers to report information related to payments to clinicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Some states and local jurisdictions require the\nregistration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which\ndiffer from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of their exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that business activities can be subject to challenge under one\nor more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in\nlight of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare\ncompanies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.\nEnsuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. If business operations are\nfound to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations a pharmaceutical manufacturer may be subject to penalties,\nincluding civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such\nas Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a\ncorporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could\nadversely affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s ability to operate its business and the results of its operations.\n26\nUnited States Healthcare Reform Efforts\nA primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Over the last several years, there have been federal and state proposals and\nlegislation enacted regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, and\nmaking changes to healthcare financing and the delivery of care in the United States.\nThere continues to be heightened Congressional scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices designed to, among other things, bring more\ntransparency in product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for\nproducts. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly enacted legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing,\nincluding price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some\ncases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using\nbidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs.\nIn addition, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States that could impact cell therapy. Most notably, there has been\npolitical support for rules related to value-based payment alternatives in the Medicaid program. Medicaid is a jointly run federal and state program that provides health benefits\ncoverage for low-income residents and children. In exchange for broad coverage in Medicaid, drug manufacturers are required to sign a Medicare Drug Rebate agreement which\nrequires them to offer Medicaid programs the “best price” available for a particular product. This “best price” takes into consideration any rebates or concessions manufacturers\noffer, with some exceptions. The final rule would exempt value-based or outcomes-based payment arrangements from the definition of “best price” which provides\nmanufacturers more flexibility to work with commercial payers and states on innovate payment mechanisms for high-cost cell and gene therapies. While Medicaid is not a\nsignificant driver of cell therapy sales it is a bellwether program and one we watch closely.\nUnited States FCPA, the Bribery Act and Other Laws\nThe FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any\nforeign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or\nretaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain\nbooks and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of\ninternal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil\nfines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.\nOur operations are also subject to non-U.S. anti-corruption laws such as the Bribery Act. As with the FCPA, these laws generally prohibit us and our employees and\nintermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to government officials or\nother persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Under the Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing to prevent a person associated with us\nfrom committing a bribery offense.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United\nKingdom and the United States and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and embargoes on certain countries\nand persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as trade control laws.\nFailure to comply with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and trade control laws could subject us to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement\nand other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses.\n27\nReview and Approval of New Drug Products in the European Union\nIn the European Union, medicinal products, including advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by\nregulatory authorities at both the European Union and national levels. ATMPs comprise gene therapy products, somatic-cell therapy products and tissue engineered products,\nwhich are cells or tissues that have undergone substantial manipulation and that are administered to human beings in order to regenerate, repair or replace a human tissue. We\nanticipate that our therapy products will be regulated as ATMPs in the European Union. There is legislation at a European Union level relating to the standards of quality and\nsafety for the collection and testing of human blood and blood components for use in cell-based therapies, which could apply to our products. Additionally, there may be local\nlegislation in various European Union Member States, which may be more restrictive than the European Union legislation, and we would need to comply with such legislation\nto the extent it applies.\nEU Clinical Trials\nClinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International\nConference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practices, or GCP. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on\ntraceability, apply to clinical trials of ATMPs. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most European Union countries, the sponsor is liable to provide\n“no fault” compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.\nPrior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent\nethics committee. The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier\ncontaining information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to\nthe competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is to take effect in December 2021,\nthere will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited\ninvolvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant\ncompetent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and European Union-wide\nregulatory requirements also apply.\nDuring the development of a medicinal product, the EMA and national medicines regulators within the European Union provide the opportunity for dialogue and\nguidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the\nCommittee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on\nquestions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-\nmanagement programs. In accordance with the EMA’s policy, scientific advice will not be legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application of the\nproduct concerned.\nEU Marketing Authorizations\nIn order to market a new medicinal product in the European Union, a company must submit and obtain approval from regulators of a marketing authorization\napplication, or MAA. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.\nThe centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization, or MA, granted by the European Commission that is valid across the EEA (i.e., the European\nUnion as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as\ngenetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases,\nautoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated orphan medicines and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic\ncell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. Therefore, the centralized\nprocedure would be mandatory for the products we are developing.\nThe Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CAT is primarily responsible for the\nscientific evaluation of ATMPs and prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of each ATMP for which a marketing authorization application is submitted. The\nCAT’s opinion is then taken into account by the CHMP when giving its final recommendation regarding the authorization of a product in view of the balance of benefits and\nrisks identified. Although the CAT’s draft opinion is submitted to the CHMP for final approval, the CHMP may depart from the draft opinion, if it provides detailed scientific\njustification. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs and have published numerous guidelines, including specific guidelines on gene\ntherapies and cell therapies. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and\ninclude, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a marketing\nauthorization application; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long-term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although\nthese guidelines are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain and maintain approval for any of our product candidates.\n28\nUnder the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock\nstops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. At the end of the review period, the\nCHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this is opinion favorable, the Commission may then adopt a decision to grant an MA. In exceptional cases, the\nCHMP might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days. This is usually when the product is of major interest from the point of view of public health\nand, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation.\nThe European Commission may grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances”. Such authorization is intended for products for which\nthe applicant can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the\nproduct in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of\nscientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information.\nConsequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following:\n● the applicant must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a\nreassessment of the benefit/risk profile;\n● the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly\nin a hospital and in the case of a radiopharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and\n● the package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal\nproduct in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects.\nA marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is subject to annual review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in an annual reassessment procedure.\nContinuation of the authorization is linked to the annual reassessment and a negative assessment could potentially result in the marketing authorization being suspended or\nrevoked. The renewal of a marketing authorization of a medicinal product under exceptional circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a “normal” marketing\nauthorization. Thus, a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely,\nunless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal.\nThe European Commission may also grant a so-called “conditional marketing authorization” prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an\napplication for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan\nmedicinal products), if (i) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required\ncomprehensive clinical trial data, (iii) the product fulfills an unmet medical need and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal\nproduct concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be\nfulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of\npharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an\nassessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to\nthe review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.\nEU Data Exclusivity\nMarketing authorization applications for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of preclinical and clinical trials, but instead can refer to the data\nincluded in the marketing authorization of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity has expired. If a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product\ncontaining a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of\nthat product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the\nmarket. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is\napproved.\nThere is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a\ngeneric medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical\ntrials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no\nsuch guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be\napproved in the European Union. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory\nexperience gained at the time.\nEU Pediatric Development\nIn the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree to a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the EMA and must conduct pediatric\nclinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a deferral or waiver applies, (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The marketing authorization\napplication for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in\nwhich case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted\nin accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in\nthe case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically\navailable when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.\n29\nEU Post-Approval Controls\nThe holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, or\nQPPV, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety\nupdate reports, or PSURs.\nAll new marketing authorization applications must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in\nplace and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of\nthe marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs,\nor the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited\nredactions. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label\npromotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and\npromotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to\nanother.\nEU Pricing and Reimbursement in the European Union\nGovernments influence the price of medicinal products in the European Union through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that\nfund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a\nreimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-\neffectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and\ncontrol company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high\nbarriers are being erected to the entry of new products.\nBrexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom\nThe United Kingdom officially withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”). Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between\nthe United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, or the Transition Period, during which European\nUnion rules continued to apply. A trade and cooperation agreement, or the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, that outlines the future trading relationship between the United\nKingdom and the European Union was agreed in December 2020.\nBrexit may influence the attractiveness of the United Kingdom as a place to conduct clinical trials. The European Union’s regulatory environment for clinical trials is\nbeing harmonized as part of the Clinical Trial Regulations, which come into full effect at the end of 2021, but it is currently unclear as to what extent the United Kingdom will\nseek to align its regulations with the European Union. Failure of the United Kingdom to closely align its regulations with the EU may have an effect on the cost of conducting\nclinical trials in the United Kingdom as opposed to other countries and/or make it harder to seek a marketing authorization for our product candidates on the basis of clinical\ntrials conducted in the United Kingdom.\nIn the short term there will be few changes to clinical trials that only have sites in the United Kingdom. The MHRA have confirmed that the sponsor of a clinical trial\ncan be based in the EEA for an initial period following Brexit. Further investigational medicinal products can be supplied directly from the EU/EEA to a trial site in the United\nKingdom without further oversight until January 1, 2022, and to Northern Ireland beyond such date. The United Kingdom is now a “third country” for the purpose of clinical\ntrials that have sites in the EEA. For such trials the sponsor/legal representative must be based in the EEA, and the trial must be registered on the EU Clinical Trials Register\n(including data on sites outside of the EEA).\nThe data exclusivity periods in the United Kingdom are currently in line with those in the European Union, but the Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides that the\nperiods for both data and market exclusivity are to be determined by domestic law, and so there could be divergence in the future. It is currently unclear whether the MHRA in\nthe United Kingdom is sufficiently prepared to handle the increased volume of marketing authorization applications that it is likely to receive.\nOrphan designation in the United Kingdom following Brexit is based on the prevalence of the condition in the United Kingdom as opposed to the current position\nwhere prevalence in the European Union is the determinant. It is therefore possible that conditions that are currently designated as orphan conditions in the United Kingdom will\nno longer be and that conditions that are not currently designated as orphan conditions in the European Union will be designated as such in the United Kingdom.\n30\nEU Orphan Drug Designation\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) and FDA play a central role in facilitating the development and authorization of medicines for rare diseases, which are\ntermed ‘orphan medicines’ in the medical world. In the EU, sponsors who obtain orphan designation benefit from protocol assistance, a type of scientific advice specific for\ndesignated orphan medicines, and market exclusivity once the medicine is on the market. Fee reductions are also available depending on the status of the sponsor and the type of\nservice required. When planning the development of their medicinal product, sponsors should consult the relevant scientific guidelines.\nThe general therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AML has not changed substantially over the past 30 years. Excluding APL (which should be treated with all trans-\nretinoic acid), AML management is based primarily on induction, incorporating an anthracycline and cytarabine, and consolidation therapy, and/or allogeneic Hematopoietic\nStem Cell Transplantation (alloHSCT). Induction/consolidation therapy leads to high CRs rates in those who are eligible for treatment and present a favorable risk profile.\nSeveral novel agents are in various stages of development for the treatment of AML. Novel approaches include antibody-based immunotherapy and adoptive cell\ntherapy that aim to improve anti-leukaemia T cell function, such as the therapies developed by TCB (OmnImmune®). OmnImmune® (TCB002) was initially studied in patients\nwith active relapsed or refractory AML who are not eligible or do not consent to high dose salvage chemotherapy and/or alloHSCT. In July 2019, OmnImmune® (TCB002) was\ngranted ‘orphan medicine’ status from the FDA for Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). As a follow on to OmnImmune® (TCB002), TCB intends to conduct phase 2b/3 studies\nto treat earlier stage AML and expects to commence treating patients in these trials (as OmnImmune® (TCB008-001)) in H1 2022.\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business.\nIn accordance with the terms of a Convertible Loan Note (‘Note’) on August 9, 2022 (the Conversion Date) the Company issued 183,820 Ordinary Shares and 367,640\nlisted warrants to the Note holder in full satisfaction of the Note in the aggregate amount of $781,233. The holder filed a claim in the English courts on June 19, 2023 asserting\nthat notice was provided such that the Company should have paid it the value of the Note in cash, rather than by settling it through the issuance of Ordinary Shares and listed\nwarrants. The holder is demanding payment of the face value of the Note, together with interest, (approximately $860,000). The litigation process is in its early stages and is not\nexpected to conclude until late 2024 or later. The Company has retained English solicitors and is contesting the claim in its entirety. The Company believes that it acted\ncorrectly under the terms of the Note and has accounted for the transaction on that basis, and that no further amounts are payable to the holder.\nSegment Information\nWe operate in a single operating segment and a single reporting segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate\nfinancial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker function (which is fulfilled by our chief executive officer) in deciding how to allocate\nresources and in assessing performance. Our chief executive officer allocates resources and assesses performance based upon financial information at the level. Since we\noperate in one operating segment, all required financial segment information is presented in the financial statements.\nCorporate Information\nOur corporate headquarters and most of our operations, including our research and manufacturing facilities, are located at Maxim 1, 2 Parklands Way, Holytown,\nMotherwell, ML1 4WR, United Kingdom. The lease for this space expires February 28, 2029 and covers a total leasable area of approximately 26,300 square feet. We believe\nthat our office facilities and the production and research facilities in the United Kingdom are sufficient to meet our current needs.\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier\nof: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or\n(c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the\nprior June 30th, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\n31\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain a public website at https://tcbiopharm.com and use our website as a routine channel of distribution of company information, including press releases,\nanalyst presentations, and supplemental financial information, as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under\nRegulation FD. Our website includes an investors’ section through which we make available, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K (for the year ended December\n31, 2023), our Annual Reports on 20-F (for periods prior to December 31, 2023), Reports on Form 6-K, as well as any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant\nto the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Accordingly, investors should monitor our\nwebsite in addition to following press releases, filings with the SEC, and public conference calls and webcasts.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those risks discussed at length in the section below titled “Risk Factors.” These risks include\namong others the following:\n● We have generated operating losses since inception and expect to continue to generate losses. We may never achieve or maintain profitability. We will continue to\nrequire financing to continue to implement our business plan and sustain operations.\n● We, as well as our independent registered public accounting firm, in relation to our financial position, have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\n● Our lack of any approved products and our limited operating history may make it difficult for an investor to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our\nfuture viability.\n● GD-T cell therapies are a novel approach to treating cancers and infectious diseases, which have development risks and will require us to obtain regulatory approvals for\ndevelopment, testing, commercialization, manufacturing and distribution. We may not achieve all the required regulatory approvals or approvals may not be obtained as\ntimely as needed.\n● Because GD-T cell therapies are a novel approach, potential side effects, and long-term efficacy, regulatory approval will require considerable time for trials, data\ncollection, regulatory submissions and funding for the process.\n● Enrolling patients in clinical trials may be difficult for many reasons, including high screen failure, GD-T cell proliferation capacity, timing, proximity and availability of\nclinical sites, perceived risks, and publicity about the success or lack of success in the methods of treatment.\n● Because GD-T cell therapies are novel, our research and development and clinical trial results may not support our products intended purposes and regulatory approval.\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our lead product candidate (OmnImmune®), and intend to seek breakthrough therapy designation for some or all of our other\ntherapeutic candidates in due course.\n● Market opportunities for certain of our product candidates may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments. This class of patient\nmay be limited in number, difficult to locate and service, require special governmental approval, and unable to pay or obtain reimbursement.\n● We rely on many third parties for aspects of our product development and commercialization, such as raw material supply, clinical trials, obtaining approvals, aspects of\nmanufacturing, development of additional product candidates and distribution. We may not be able to control these parties and their business practices, such as\ncompliance with good manufacturing requirements or their ability to supply or service us timely, which will likely disrupt our business.\n● We face substantial competition: others may discover, develop and/or commercialize competing products before or more successfully than TCB.\n● Even if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, such drugs may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and\nreimbursement policies. Commercialized products may not be adopted by the medical profession.\n● Because we operate internationally, we are subject to a wide array of regulation of the United Kingdom, European Union and United States. In addition to regulation\nsurrounding new drug development and their manufacture, distribution and use, we will be subject, for example to data protection rules relating to medical records,\nmedical and general privacy laws, environmental laws regarding medical waste, and bribery and corrupt practices law, in addition to all the drug related approval,\nmanufacturing and distribution rules.\n32\n● Product liability claims are frequent in drug development of novel therapies and insurance is mandatory and expensive. The inability to obtain insurance may prevent\nproduct development and claims may surpass our ability to pay and call into question the efficacy of a product with resulting reputational damage.\n● Protecting our intellectual property is paramount in our ability to be able to commercialize our products and generate revenues and investment return for our\nstockholders. We may not be able to obtain the intellectual property protection we seek due to its cost, requirement to pursue it in many jurisdictions, challenges by\nothers and patent office rejection.\n● Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by\ngovernmental patent agencies acting in multiple jurisdictions, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\n● As part of product development, we may need to license aspects of our research and products from third parties or if our IP is challenged, we may have to seek license\naccommodation, any of which may be expensive, limited in scope, or unavailable.\n● We currently have a limited number of employees, and our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified\npersonnel at all levels.\n● We will need to grow the size and capabilities of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth including, but not limited to, operating as\na public company and taking a therapeutic through to market approval and acceptance.\n● We expect to expand our development and regulatory capabilities and potentially implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may\nencounter difficulties in achieving and managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations. We expect to require further funding for these expansions of activity.\n● We incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company in the United States, and our management is required to devote substantial time to required SEC\ncompliance and corporate governance practices.\n● If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would\nadversely affect our business and our stock price.\n● Certain of our existing shareholders, members of our board of directors and senior management maintain the ability to exercise significant control over us. The interests\nof investors may conflict with the interests of these other stockholders.\n● Our ADSs provide rights that are different from directly holding our ordinary shares. The outstanding warrants do not have the rights of shareholders until exercised.\nOur warrants form a substantial part of our capitalization, and they have substantial protective provisions, which may limit our ability to raise capital.\n● Future sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial number of our ordinary shares, through the additional deposit of ordinary shares for ADSs, issuances and/or\nexercises of our warrants, could adversely affect the price of our ADSs or warrants in the market. After any lock up period, a substantial number of our issued and\noutstanding ordinary shares will be eligible for trading on the public securities market by their being deposited with the depositary for ADSs.\n● Shareholder rights and recourse will be governed by and ultimately determined by Scottish and United Kingdom law and judicial process, which in many ways are more\nlimited than United States law and practice. Most of our assets are located in the United Kingdom.\n● If we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq, our ADSs could be delisted from trading, which would decrease the liquidity of our ADSs and our\nability to raise additional capital.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred net losses every year since our inception and expect to continue to incur net losses in the future and may never achieve profitability.\nWe have generated losses since our inception in 2013. Since then, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development efforts relating to\nour genetically unmodified and genetically engineered GD-T cell candidates, including engaging in activities to manufacture and supply our GD-T cell candidates for clinical\ntrials, conducting initial clinical trials of our lead candidates, general and administrative support for these operations, and protecting our intellectual property. Based on our\ncurrent plans, we do not expect to generate product or royalty revenues until we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, any of our GD-T cell-based candidates.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred net losses of £5.9 million and £1.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had an\naccumulated deficit of £38.8 million. We expect to continue incurring significant losses as we continue with our research and development and clinical programs and to incur\ngeneral and administrative costs associated with our operations. The extent of funding required to develop our product candidates is difficult to estimate given the novel nature\nof our GD-T cell-based cell therapy candidates and their un-proven route to market. Ultimately, our profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval, and\ncommercialization of our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates and achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. We may never achieve profitability\nand until we do, we will continue to need to raise additional cash.\n33\nOur ability to generate revenue from sales of our therapeutic candidates and become profitable depends significantly on our success in a number of factors.\nWe continue to focus on development activities for our technologies and implementation of the early parts of our business plan. We may never achieve commercial\nsuccess and continue to operate in the research and development stage, without commercially launching any products at this time. We have limited historical financial data upon\nwhich we may base our projected revenue and base our planned operating expenses. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our\npotential product candidates, drug therapies or prospective operations and business prospects. As a development stage company, we are subject to all the risks inherent in the\ninitial organization, business development, financing, unexpected expenditures, and complications and delays that often occur in a new business. Investors should evaluate an\ninvestment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful\nor that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.\nWe have no GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from sales of our GD-T cell-based therapeutic\ncandidates, and do not anticipate generating any revenue from sales of our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates until sometime after we receive regulatory approval, if at all,\nfor the commercial sale of a GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidate. We intend to fund future operations through our existing and future collaboration and licensing agreements\nfor other therapeutic targets and through additional equity financings. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our success in many factors,\nincluding:\n● completing research regarding, and preclinical and clinical development of, our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates;\n● obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations for our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates for which we complete clinical trials;\n● developing sustainable and scalable manufacturing and supply processes for our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates, including establishing and maintaining\ncommercially viable supply relationships with third parties and pursuing our own commercial manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure;\n● launching and commercializing GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates for which we obtain regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations, either directly or with a\ncollaborator or distributor;\n● obtaining market acceptance of our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates as viable treatment options;\n● addressing any competing technological and market developments;\n● identifying, assessing, acquiring and/or developing new GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates;\n● maintaining, protecting, and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how; and\n● attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with\ncommercializing any approved GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidate. Our expenses will increase beyond our current expectations if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,\nthe FDA, or the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the MHRA, or any other regulatory agency require changes to our manufacturing\nprocesses or assays, or for us to perform preclinical programs and clinical or other types of trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate. If we are successful in\nobtaining regulatory approvals to market one or more of our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the\nterritories for which we gain regulatory approval, the accepted price for the GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidate, the ability to get reimbursement at any price, and whether we\nown the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable disease patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory\nauthorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not\ngenerate significant revenue from sales or supplies of such GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates, even if approved. If we are not able to generate revenue from the sale of any\napproved GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates, we may never become profitable.\n34\nIf we fail to obtain additional financing as needed, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our GD-T cell-based product candidates.\nOur operations have required substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to continue the development of our GD-\nT cell-based therapeutic candidates, including for clinical trials. We expect to use our operating capital to advance and accelerate the clinical development of our therapeutic\ncandidates, therefore, changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to increase our spending significantly faster than we currently anticipate, we believe we will\nrequire additional capital, likely in significant amounts, for the further development and commercialization of our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We have no committed source of additional capital. If we are unable to\nraise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization\nof our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates or other research and development initiatives. Our license and supply agreements may also be terminated if we are unable to meet\nthe milestone obligations under these agreements. We could be required to seek collaborators for our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise\nwould be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our GD-T cell-based\ntherapeutic candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves. Any of the above events could significantly harm our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of either of our ADSs or Warrants, or both, to decline.\nWe, as well as our independent registered public accounting firm, have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur recurring losses from operations and negative cash flow raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent\nregistered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 with respect to this\nuncertainty.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern ultimately is dependent upon our generating cash flow from sales that are sufficient to fund operations or finding adequate\nfinancing to support our operations. To date, we have had no product revenues and relied on equity-based financing from the sale of securities subscribed by our founders and\nrelated parties and in various private placements, and receipts from collaboration partners. Our research and development plans may not be successful in creating a marketable\nproduct, and our business plan may not be successful in achieving a sustainable business and generating revenues. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in February\n2022, which, together with additional funds that we have raised since then and funds we plan to raise during 2024, we believe will provide funding to enable us to progress our\nplanned clinical trial program in our lead product, OmnImmune®, into 2024 and beyond. We have no firm arrangements in place for all the anticipated, required financing to be\nable to fund our operations during and beyond 2024 and otherwise to implement fully our business plan. If we are unable to continue our operations as planned, we may have to\ncurtail some or all of our business plan and operations. In such case, investors will lose all or a portion of their investment.\nWe anticipate needing additional financing over the longer term to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on\nreasonable terms or at all.\nThe proceeds from our February 2022 IPO, together with additional capital raised since then and funds that we plan to continue to raise during 2024, are expected to\nprovide capital to further develop our drug product candidates and fund our overall business plan until at least the end of 2024. We will require additional capital in the future to\nfully develop our technologies and potential products to the stage of a commercial launch. We cannot give now any indication of the amount of future funding that we will need\nor give any assurance that we will be able to obtain all the necessary funding that we may need. We may pursue additional funding through various financing sources, including\nthe private and public sale of our equity and debt securities, licensing fees for our product candidates, joint ventures with capital partners and project type financing. We also\nmay seek government-based financing, such as development and research grants. There can be no assurance that funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at\nall. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to pursue further our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case\ninvestors may lose their entire investment. Alternatively, we may consider changes in our business plan that might enable us to achieve aspects of our business objectives and\nlead to some commercial success with a smaller amount of capital, but we cannot assure that changes in our business plan will result in revenues or maintain value in an\ninvestment in the company.\nOn March 22, 2024, the Group had cash on hand of $1.7 million (£1.4 million), which will not be sufficient to enable the Group to meet the cash requirements required\nto enable it to conduct its business plan through the going concern period (being to April 1, 2025) (“Going Concern Period”). With existing resources, we expect to be able to\nfund current operations to May 2024.\n35\nRisks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Commercialization of Our Investigational Therapies and Any Future Therapeutic Candidates\nOur GD-T cell therapies represent a novel approach to cancer treatment that could result in heightened regulatory scrutiny, delays in clinical development, or delays in or\nour ability to achieve regulatory approval or commercialization of our therapeutic candidates.\nOur products are novel cancer treatment approaches that carry inherent development risks. We are therefore constantly evaluating and adapting our therapeutic\ncandidates following the results obtained during development work and the ongoing clinical trials. Further development, characterization and evaluation may be required,\ndepending on the results obtained, in particular where such results suggest any potential safety risk for patients. The need to develop further assays, or to modify in any way the\nprotocols related to our therapeutic candidates to improve safety or effectiveness, may delay a clinical program, regulatory approval or commercialization, if approved at all, of\nany therapeutic candidate. Consequently, this may have a material impact on our ability to receive milestone payments and/or generate revenues from our therapeutic candidates\nand raise equity capital. In addition, given the novelty of our GD-T cell therapeutic candidates, the end users and medical personnel require a substantial amount of education\nand training in their administration of our cell therapy. Regulatory authorities have very limited experience with commercial cell therapies for disease treatment. As a result,\nregulators may be more risk averse or require substantial dialogue and education as part of the normal regulatory approval process for each stage of development of our\ntherapeutic candidates.\nGD-T cell therapy creates significantly increased risk in terms of side-effect profile, ability to satisfy regulatory requirements associated with clinical trials, and the long-\nterm efficacy of administered cells.\nDevelopment of a pharmaceutical or biologic therapy product has inherent risks based on differences in patient population and responses to therapy and treatment. The\nmechanism of action and impact on other systems and tissues within the human body following administration of GD-T cell therapy products is not completely understood,\nwhich means that we cannot predict the long-term effects of treatment with the GD-T cell therapy product. We are aware that certain patients may not respond to GD-T cell\ntherapy and other patients may relapse. The percentage of the patient population in which these events may occur is unknown, but the inability of patients to respond and the\npossibility of relapse may impact our ability to conduct clinical trials, to obtain regulatory approvals, if at all, and to successfully commercialize our therapeutic products.\nOur GD-T cell therapeutic candidates and their application are not fully scientifically understood and are still undergoing validation and investigation. The utility of\nour GD-T cell products may depend on persistence, potency, durability and infiltration capacity of the GD-T cells within a patient’s body. The level of persistence and the\nfactors affecting such persistence, potency and infiltration capacity in patients are not completely understood, which presents an additional risk to the ongoing development and\nuse of our therapeutic candidates. Certain steps involved in validating and carrying out testing require access to samples (for example tissue samples or cell samples) from third\nparties. Such samples may be obtained from universities or research institutions and will often be provided subject to satisfaction of certain terms and conditions. There can be\nno guarantee that we will be able to obtain samples in sufficient quantities to enable development of and use of the full preclinical safety testing program for CAR-T therapeutic\ncandidates undergoing development. In addition, the terms under which such samples are available may not be acceptable to us or may restrict our use of any generated results\nor require us to make payments to third parties.\nOur products, before they can be commercialized, will require regulatory approval.\nWe cannot commercialize a product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Approval by the FDA,\nthe MHRA and comparable other regulatory authorities is lengthy and unpredictable, and depends upon numerous factors. Approval policies, regulations, or the type and\namount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate’s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may\ncause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application. We have not obtained commercialization regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is\npossible that any of our product candidates will never obtain regulatory approval.\nApplications for product candidates we may develop could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including but not limited to:\n● our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities that a product candidate we develop is safe and effective;\n● the regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n● the population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval;\n● the regulatory authorities’ requirement for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n● the regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n● the data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, or other submission for regulatory approval;\n36\n● we may be unable to demonstrate to the regulatory authorities that a product candidate’s risk-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable;\n● the regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications, or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we\ncontract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n● the approval policies or regulations of the regulatory authorities may change in a manner that renders our clinical trial design or data insufficient for approval.\nThe lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials, may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market a product\ncandidate in the United States, the UK, the EU or elsewhere, which would significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in completing our clinical trials, which in turn will result in additional costs and may ultimately prevent successful or timely\ncompletion of the clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans before commercialization. Clinical testing is\nexpensive, time-consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure\nof one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n● delays in reaching, or any failure to reach, a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design;\n● delays in obtaining FDA required Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical trial site;\n● delays in recruiting a sufficient number of suitable patients to participate in our clinical trials;\n● imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies, after an inspection of our clinical trial operations or study sites;\n● failure by third parties or us to adhere to clinical trial, regulatory or legal requirements;\n● failure to perform in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCP”), or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\n● delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of sufficient quantities of our product candidates to the clinical sites;\n● delays in having patients’ complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n● clinical trial sites or patients dropping out of a trial;\n● delay or failure to address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n● unanticipated costs or increases in costs of clinical trials of our product candidates;\n● occurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits; or\n● changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us or by regulators and related reviewing authorities such as IRBs of the institutions in\nwhich such trials are being conducted, by an independent Safety Review Board. Suspension or termination of a clinical trial might be due to a number of factors, including\nfailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site resulting in the\nimposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, or failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a therapy. In addition, if we make manufacturing or\nformulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. In addition, any delays\nin completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory\napprovals, commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n37\nManufacturing and administering our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates is complex, and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to\nprocess development or scaling-up of our manufacturing capabilities. If we encounter such difficulties, our ability to supply of our GD-T cell therapeutic candidates for\nclinical trials or for commercial purposes could be delayed or stopped.\nManufacturing and administrating our GD-T cell-based therapeutics candidates is complex and highly regulated. The manufacture process of our GD-T cell-based\ntherapeutics involves complex processes, including peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation from leukapheresis material, stimulation of the GD-T cells, expansion of the\ncells to obtain a desired dose, and ultimately infusion of the cells to the patient’s body. On occasions the GD-T cell therapeutic could be genetically modified, which could\ninvolve manufacturing of lentiviral vectors containing the gene of our interest (for example Chimeric Antigen Receptor) and transducing the cells or a method such as\nelectroporation or nucleofection of a plasmid containing the gene of interest to the cells. As a result of the complexities, our manufacturing and supply costs are likely to be\nhigher than those in more traditional manufacturing processes and the manufacturing process is less reliable and more difficult to reproduce. Our manufacturing process is, and\nwill be, susceptible to product loss or failure due to logistical issues, including manufacturing issues associated with the differences in patients’ white blood cells, interruptions\nin the manufacturing process, contamination, equipment or reagent failure, supplier error and variability in GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidate and patient characteristics.\nEven minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects, and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other\ncontaminations are discovered in our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our GD-T cell based therapeutic candidates are made or\nadministered, the manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. As our GD-T cell-based\ntherapeutic candidates progress through preclinical programs and clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is expected that various aspects of the manufacturing\nand administration process will be altered in an effort to optimize processes and results.\nWe have identified some improvements to our manufacturing and administration processes, but these changes may not achieve the intended objectives, and could\ncause our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials. The changes may require\namendments to be made to regulatory applications which may further delay the timeframes under which modified manufacturing processes can be used for any GD-T cell-based\ntherapeutic candidate. For example, we are planning to introduce automated enclosed systems to our production process. This will require development work to ensure that these\nmodifications do not alter the characteristics of the product. If the GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidate manufactured under the new process has a worse safety or efficacy\nprofile than the prior investigational product, we may need to re-evaluate the use of that manufacturing process, which could significantly delay the progress of our clinical\ntrials.\nDeveloping a commercially viable process is a difficult and uncertain task and there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for advanced clinical trials or\ncommercialization, including, among others, increased costs, potential problems with process scale-out, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency, and timely\navailability of reagents or raw materials. We may ultimately be unable to reduce the expenses associated with our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates to levels that will\nallow us to achieve a profitable return on investment. If we are unable to demonstrate that our commercial scale product is comparable to the product used in clinical trials, we\nmay not receive regulatory approval for that product without additional clinical trials. Even if we are successful, our manufacturing capabilities could be affected by increased\ncosts, unexpected delays, equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors that could prevent us from realizing the intended\nbenefits of our manufacturing strategy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may seek expedited approval in the European Union and United States for our therapeutic candidates, but we may not be able to obtain or maintain such designation.\nThe FDA and the European Medicines Agency, the EMA, have established programs to expedite drug development and regulatory review. The FDA has four main\nexpedited programs: fast track (introduced in 1987), accelerated approval (1992), priority review (1992), and breakthrough therapy (2012). A priority review designation in\nNorth America will direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for drugs that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or\neffectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. Significant improvement may be demonstrated by the\nfollowing examples:\n● evidence of increased effectiveness in treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of condition;\n● elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction;\n● documented enhancement of patient compliance that is expected to lead to an improvement in serious outcomes; or\n● evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation.\n38\nWe intend to seek breakthrough therapy designation for some or all of our therapeutic candidates, but there can be no assurance that we will receive breakthrough\ntherapy designation. Additionally, other treatments from competing companies may obtain the designations and impact our ability to develop and commercialize our therapeutic\ncandidates, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operation. We may also seek fast track designation. If a drug or biologic candidate is\nintended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition or disease and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition, the\nsponsor may apply for fast track designation. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug or biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate\nfor a specific indication as a fast track drug or biologic concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug or biologic\ncandidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Even if we do apply for and receive fast track designation, we may not\nexperience a faster development, review or approval process compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the\ndesignation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. We may also seek accelerated approval for products that have obtained fast track\ndesignation. Under the FDA’s fast track and accelerated approval programs, the FDA may approve a drug or biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides\nmeaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint\nthat can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit,\ntaking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. For drugs granted accelerated approval, post-\nmarketing confirmatory trials have been required to describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must\nbe completed with due diligence.\nThe EMA has three programs, the accelerated assessment (2005), conditional marketing authorization (2006), and the Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme (2016).\nThese programs are intended to prioritize the most important medicines for faster access by patients. As part of its marketing authorization process, the EMA may grant\nconditional marketing authorizations for certain categories of medicinal products on the basis of less complete data than is normally required, when doing so may meet unmet\nmedical needs of patients and may serve the interest of public health. In these cases, it is possible for the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the CHMP, to\nrecommend the granting of a marketing authorization, subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually, which is referred to as a conditional marketing\nauthorization. This may apply to medicinal products for human use that fall under the jurisdiction of the EMA, including those that aim at the treatment, the prevention, or the\nmedical diagnosis of seriously debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases and those designated as orphan medicinal products. A conditional marketing authorization may\nbe granted when the CHMP finds that, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product have not been supplied, the risk-benefit\nbalance of the medicinal product is positive. The granting of a conditional marketing authorization is restricted to situations in which only the clinical part of the application is\nnot yet fully complete. Incomplete preclinical or quality data may only be accepted if duly justified and only in the case of a product intended to be used in emergency situations\nin response to public-health threats. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, on a renewable basis. The holder will be required to complete ongoing trials or\nto conduct new trials with a view to confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive. In addition, specific obligations may be imposed in relation to the collection of\npharmacovigilance data. Granting a conditional marketing authorization allows medicines to reach patients with unmet medical needs earlier than might otherwise be the case\nand will ensure that additional data on a product are generated, submitted, assessed and acted upon. Although we may seek a conditional marketing authorization for our\ntherapeutic candidates, the EMA or CHMP may ultimately not agree that the requirements for conditional marketing authorization have been satisfied and hence delay the\ncommercialization of our therapeutic candidates.\nIn the European Union, accelerated assessment can reduce the timeframe for EMA’s CHMP to review a marketing-authorization application. Applications may be\neligible for accelerated assessment if the CHMP decides the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation. The evaluation of a marketing-\nauthorization application can take up to 210 days. However, the CHMP can reduce the timeframe to 150 days if the applicant can provide sufficient justification for an\naccelerated assessment. The Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme was introduced by the EMA in 2016 to support the development of medicines addressing unmet medical needs\nwhich offer a therapeutic advantage over existing treatments. To be accepted in the PRIME scheme, the treatments must meet the eligibility criteria for accelerated assessment\nincluding a strongly substantiated mechanism of action, supportive preclinical data, and first-in-human tolerance data. PRIME has been compared to the U.S. Breakthrough\nTherapy Designation.\nWithdrawal of expedited approval will delay trials and likely increase cost.\nThe FDA or EMA may withdraw expedited approval of our therapeutic candidate or indication approved under the accelerated approval pathway if, for example:\n● the trial or trials required to verify the predicted clinical benefit of our therapeutic candidate fail to verify such benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to\njustify the risks associated with the drug;\n● other evidence demonstrates that our therapeutic candidate is not shown to be safe or effective under the conditions of use;\n● we fail to conduct any required post-approval trial of our therapeutic candidate with due diligence; or\n● we disseminate false or misleading promotional materials relating to the relevant therapeutic candidate.\n39\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our therapeutic candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval\nof our therapeutic candidates in other jurisdictions.\nWe plan on submit marketing applications in multiple jurisdictions and countries, including the UK, the EU and the United States. Regulatory authorities in each\njurisdiction have requirements for approval of therapeutic candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those jurisdictions. Obtaining regulatory approvals and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions and countries could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the\nintroduction of our therapeutic candidates in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing\napprovals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our therapeutic candidates will be harmed.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our therapeutic candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory\napproval in any other jurisdiction, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in\nothers. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of our key products in the United States, comparable regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions must also\napprove the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of our products in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and may require additional preclinical\nprograms or clinical trials. In many jurisdictions a therapeutic candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some\ncases, the price that we intend to charge for our therapeutic candidates is also subject to approval.\nWe may face difficulty in enrolling patients in our clinical trials.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials. For example, in our TCB-001 clinical trial we experienced a high screen failure rate. Identifying and\nqualifying patients, including testing of patients for their GD-T cells’ proliferation capacity, to participate in clinical trials of our therapeutic candidates, are critical to our\nsuccess. The timing of our current and future clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our therapeutic candidates. If patients\nare unwilling to participate in our trial(s) because of negative publicity from adverse reactions or for other reasons, including competitive clinical trials for similar patient\npopulations, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting trials and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed or prevented. These delays could\nresult in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether. We\nmay not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve sufficient diversity in a given trial in\norder to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. Patient enrolment is affected by factors including:\n● eligibility criteria for the trial in question;\n● severity of the disease under investigation;\n● design of the trial protocol;\n● trial duration and number and complexity of visits and procedures;\n● size of the patient population;\n● perceived risks and benefits of the therapeutic candidate under trial;\n● novelty of the therapeutic candidate and acceptance by oncologists;\n● proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n● availability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n● efforts to facilitate timely enrolment in clinical trials;\n● patient referral practices of physicians;\n● ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n● macro political or economic factors that impact the availability and efficiency of available trial centers.\nIf we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned\nclinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\n40\nThe outcome of clinical trials is uncertain and our clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of any of our T cell therapeutic candidates,\nwhich would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.\nThere is a risk in any clinical trial that side effects from our therapeutic candidates will require a hold on, or termination of, our clinical program(s) or further\nadjustments to our clinical program(s) in order to progress our therapeutic candidates. Our T cell therapeutic candidates will require evidence that they are safe before permitting\nclinical trials to commence and evidence that the therapeutic candidates are safe and effective before granting any regulatory approval. In particular, because our therapeutic\ncandidates are subject to regulation as biological products, we will need to demonstrate that they are safe, pure and potent for use in each target indication. The therapeutic\ncandidate must demonstrate an acceptable risk versus benefit profile in its intended patient population and for its intended use. The risk/benefit profile required for product\nlicensure will vary depending on these factors and may include not only the ability to show tumor shrinkage, but also adequate duration of response, a delay in the progression\nof the disease and/or an improvement in survival. For example, response rates from the use of our therapeutic candidates will not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval\nunless we can also show an adequate duration of response.\nWe may not be able to submit INDs, or the foreign equivalent outside of the United States, to continue our CAR-T clinical trials.\nWe are currently conducting preclinical development of our CAR-T therapeutic candidates. Progression of our CAR-T therapeutic candidates from pre-clinical to\nclinical development (first-in-human, phase 1) is inherently risky and dependent on the results obtained in preclinical programs, the results of other clinical programs and results\nof third-party programs that utilize common components used for production and administration of our therapeutic candidates. If results are not available when expected or\nproblems are identified during therapy development, we may experience significant delays in development of pipeline products and of existing clinical programs, which may\nimpact our ability to receive regulatory approval. This may also impact our ability to achieve certain financial milestones and the expected timeframes to market any of our\ntherapeutic candidates. Failure to submit further INDs or the foreign equivalent and commence additional clinical programs will significantly limit our opportunity to generate\nrevenue.\nOur research and development efforts may not result in the progression of our product candidates into clinical trials.\nOur research and development efforts and our selection of the product candidates to pursue remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new\ntreatment modalities. Development of the underlying technology and appropriate assay development may be affected by unanticipated technical or other problems, among other\ndevelopment and research issues, and the possible insufficiency of funds needed in order to complete development of these products. Safety, regulatory and efficacy issues,\nclinical hurdles or challenges also may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that will increase our need for capital and result in additional losses. If we\ncannot complete, or if we experience significant delays in developing our medical products for use in potential commercial applications, particularly after incurring significant\nexpenditures, our business may fail and investors may lose the entirety of their investment.\nWe will need to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, which is time consuming, costly and complicated. We may not obtain regulatory approval.\nWe cannot commercialize a product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Approval by the FDA\nand comparable foreign regulatory authorities is lengthy and unpredictable, and depends upon numerous factors. Approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of\nclinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate’s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays\nin the approval or the decision not to approve an application. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that any of our product\ncandidates will never obtain regulatory approval.\nApplications for product candidates we may develop could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons. For example, under FDA regulation, approval may not\nbe obtained for many reasons such as:\n● our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate we may develop is safe and effective;\n● the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n● the population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval;\n● the FDA’s or comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ requirement for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n● the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n● the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, or other submission\nfor regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n● we may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate’s risk-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is\nacceptable;\n● the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications, or facilities of third-party\nmanufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n● the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may change in a manner that renders our clinical trial design or data\ninsufficient for approval.\n41\nThe lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials, may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market a product\ncandidate in the United States or elsewhere, which would significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, OmnImmune®, and our subsequent product development program, If we are unable to successfully\ncomplete clinical development, obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize these products, or experience delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize our aforementioned lead product candidate\nwhich is in its clinical development phase. Before we can generate any revenues from sales of products, we will be required to conduct additional clinical development and\nconduct longer-term clinical trials and, if our clinical trial of these products is successful, we will be required to seek and obtain regulatory approval, secure adequate\nmanufacturing supply to support larger clinical trials and commercial sales and build a commercial organization, or to work with commercialization partners. Further, the\nsuccess of these products will depend on patent and trade secret protection, acceptance of these products by patients, the medical community and third-party payers, its ability to\ncompete with other therapies, healthcare coverage and reimbursement, and maintenance of an acceptable safety profile following approval, among other factors. If we do not\nachieve any of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our products which would\nmaterially harm our business.\nLaboratory conditions differ from clinical conditions and commercial conditions, which could affect the effectiveness of our potential products. Failures to effectively move\nfrom laboratory to the field would harm our business.\nObservations and developments that may be achievable under laboratory circumstances may not be replicated in commercial settings or in the use of any of the\nproposed products in the field. The failure of our product candidates under development or other future product candidates to be able to be tested, approved and manufactured in\navailable manufacturing facilities or to be able to meet the demands of users in the field would harm our business.\nResults of earlier studies may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, and initial studies may not establish an adequate safety or efficacy profile for our drugs and\nother product candidates that we may pursue to justify proceeding to advanced clinical trials or an application for regulatory approval.\nThe results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and interim results of a\nclinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Additionally, any positive results generated in our Phase 1b/2a clinical trials in adults would not ensure that we will achieve\nsimilar results in larger, pivotal clinical trials or in clinical trials in general populations. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations\nand analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain\nmarketing approval. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies\nand initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or\nadverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if early-stage clinical trials are\nsuccessful, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials for product candidates in additional patient populations or under different treatment conditions before we are able to\nseek approvals from the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the United States to market and sell these product candidates. Our failure to demonstrate the required\ncharacteristics to support marketing approval for our product candidates in any ongoing or future clinical trials would substantially harm our business, prospects, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n42\nWe manufacture and test all our therapeutic candidates in-house, and may experience logistic issues.\nThe manufacture, testing and release of TCB’s cell therapies for clinical trials may not meet with the regulatory requirements and result in the delay of clinical trials.\nLogistical issues which may prevent timely completion of manufacture and testing include:\n● failure in integrity of facility infrastructure;\n● failure of High Efficiency Particulate Absorbing (HEPA) filters to prevent airborne cross-contamination;\n● delays in the procuring test materials/reagents due to supplier, shipping issues or discontinued supply;\n● failure by third parties to notify a change in material product specifications that are not GMP (“Good Manufacturing Practice”) compliant;\n● equipment failure within production, quality control and stores;\n● failure of quality control equipment;\n● delays in cleanroom supplies from third parties such as PPE or cleaning reagents;\n● failure in the cleanroom resulting in insufficient quantities of our product candidates being available to the clinical sites;\n● increase in our costs of materials;\n● failure of third party specialist couriers to deliver the product to clinical sites;\n● failure due to resource issues associated with personnel illness; and\n● failure in recruitment of cleanroom operators and quality staff as we progress through clinical trials.\nWe conduct and manage clinical studies using internal staff trained to perform such studies and loss of these staff may delay our clinical program.\nWe are highly dependent upon the principal members of our management team and the members of our scientific team. These people have significant experience and\nknowledge within our operational sector, and the loss of any team member could impair our ability to design, identify, and develop clinical trials, new intellectual property and\nnew scientific or product ideas.\nWe expect to operate in a highly competitive, ever-evolving, market.\nThe broader market for our products is becoming more focused and potentially more competitive. Over time, we believe this field will become subject to more rapid\nchange and new drugs, therapies and other products will emerge. We may not be able to compete effectively against these companies or their products. We may find ourselves\nin competition with companies that have competitive advantages over us, such as:\n● significantly greater name recognition;\n● established relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors;\n● established distribution networks;\n● additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage;\n● greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for products, and marketing approved products;\nand\n● greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation.\nMany of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic collaborators, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly,\nour competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance and may render our treatments obsolete\nor non-competitive. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller\nnumber of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study\nsites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may\nalso prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\n43\nRapidly changing medical technology within the life sciences could make the product candidates that we are developing obsolete.\nThe medical industry is characterized by rapid and significant medical technological and therapy changes, frequent new product candidates and product introductions\nand enhancements and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend on our ability to continually develop and then improve the product candidates that we design\nand to develop and introduce new product candidates that address the evolving needs of the physicians and patients on a timely and cost-effective basis. Any new product\ncandidates and products developed by us may not be accepted in the intended markets. Our inability to gain market acceptance of new products could harm our future operating\nresults.\nThe market opportunities for certain of our product candidates may be small, due to the fact that the products may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have\nfailed prior treatments, and our projections regarding the size of the addressable market may be incorrect.\nCancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first line, second line or third line, and the FDA often approves new therapies initially only for third line use. When\nblood cancers are detected, they are treated with first line of therapy with the intention of curing the cancer. This generally consists of chemotherapy, radiation, antibody drugs,\ntumor targeted small molecules, or a combination of these. In addition, sometimes a bone marrow transplantation can be added to the first line therapy after the combination\nchemotherapy is given. If the patient’s cancer relapses, then they are given a second line or third line therapy, which can consist of more chemotherapy, radiation, antibody\ndrugs, tumor targeted small molecules, or a combination of these, or bone marrow transplant. Generally, the higher the line of therapy, the lower the chance of a cure. With third\nor higher line, the goal of the therapy in the treatment of lymphoma and myeloma is to control the growth of the tumor and extend the life of the patient, as a cure is unlikely to\nhappen. Patients are generally referred to clinical trials in these situations.\nOur projections of both the number of people who have the cancers we are targeting, as well as the size of the patient population subset of people with these cancers in\na position to receive first, second, third and fourth line therapy and who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on our beliefs and\nestimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, or market research and may prove\nto be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these cancers. The number of patients may turn out to be fewer than expected.\nAdditionally, the potentially addressable patient population for our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates. Even if\nwe obtain significant market share for our product candidates, because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve significant revenues without obtaining\nregulatory approval for additional indications or as part of earlier lines of therapy.\nWe rely on third parties to support our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be\nable to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe depend and will continue to depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities, medical institutions, CROs (“Contract Research\nOrganizations”) and strategic partners to support our clinical trials under agreements with the Company.\nWe negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs and study sites, which may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs. We will rely heavily on\nthird parties over the course of our clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is\nconducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and its reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory\nresponsibilities. TCB and these third parties are required to comply with GCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by regulatory authorities for product candidates in\nclinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third\nparties fail to comply with applicable GCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities\nwill determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with biologic product produced under cGMPs\nand will require a large number of test patients. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may\nrequire us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or\nstate fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nAny third parties supporting our clinical trials are and will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties,\nwe cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have\nrelationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which\ncould affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to\nbe replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for\nother reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully\ncommercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and\nour ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\n44\nIf any of our relationships with trial sites, or any CRO that we may use in the future, terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative trial\nsites or CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding third parties to conduct our clinical trials will involve substantial cost and require extensive\nmanagement time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new third party commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our\nability to meet its desired clinical development timelines.\nWe do not have any current sales, marketing, commercial manufacturing and distribution capabilities or arrangements, and will need to create these as we move towards\ncommercialization of our products.\nWe do not yet have commercial sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities or arrangements. We will need to develop all of the foregoing or partner\nwith organizations who have expertise in all the foregoing. We do not have any corporate experience in establishing these commercial sized capabilities. We believe that setting\nup the commercialization aspects of a company such as ours, in our field, will take a substantial amount of capital and time. Therefore, we may seek development and marketing\npartners and license our drug technologies or product candidates to others in order to avoid our having to provide the marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities\nwithin our organization. There can be no assurance that we will find any development and marketing partners or companies that are interested in licensing our drug technology\nor any of our product candidates or products. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, independently or\nwith others, we will not be able to generate product revenue, and may not become profitable.\nWe may rely on third parties to manufacture our clinical product supplies, and we may have to rely on third parties to produce and process our product candidates, if\napproved.\nAlthough to date, we have used our internal capabilities to manufacture clinical trial supplies, we do not yet have sufficient information to reliably estimate the cost of\ncommercially manufacturing and processing of our product candidates. The actual cost to manufacture and process our product candidates could materially and adversely affect\nthe commercial viability of our product candidates. As a result, we may never be able to develop a commercially viable product.\nOur manufacturing plant is located in Scotland and as we develop clinical trials outside the UK and in particular into the USA we anticipate that we will rely on a\nlimited number of third-party manufacturers for commercial production, but this will expose us to the following risks.\n● We may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the regulatory authorities may\nhave questions regarding any replacement contractor. This may require new testing and regulatory interactions. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be\neducated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products.\n● Third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely formulate and manufacture our product or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and\ncommercial needs, if any.\n● Future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to\nsuccessfully produce, store and distribute our products.\n● Manufacturers are subject to strict compliance with cGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-\nparty manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards.\n● We may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our\nproducts.\n● Third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreement(s) with us.\nContract manufacturers would also be subject to the same risks we face in developing our own manufacturing capabilities, as described above. Each of these risks\ncould delay our clinical trials, the regulatory approval, if any, of our product candidates or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us\nof potential product revenue. In addition, we will rely on third parties to perform release tests on our product candidates prior to delivery to patients. If these tests are not\nappropriately done and test data are not reliable, patients could be put at risk of serious harm.\n45\nCell-based therapies rely on the availability of specialty materials, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur product candidates require specialized materials, including viral vectors that deliver the targeting moiety (CAR) and other genes to the product candidate. We\ncurrently manufacture some of our requirements through contract manufacturers, some of which are manufactured by companies with limited resources and experience to\nsupport a commercial product, and the suppliers may not be able to deliver materials to our specifications. In addition, those suppliers normally support blood-based hospital\nbusinesses and generally do not have the capacity to support commercial products manufactured under cGMP by biopharmaceutical firms. The suppliers may be ill-equipped to\nsupport our needs, especially in non-routine circumstances like an FDA inspection or medical crisis, such as widespread contamination. We also do not have contracts with\nmany of these suppliers, and we may not be able to contract with them on acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, we may experience delays in receiving key materials to\nsupport clinical or commercial manufacturing.\nIn addition, some materials utilized in the manufacture of our candidates are currently available from a single supplier, or a small number of suppliers. For example,\nprincipal suppliers for the purchase of equipment and reagents critical for the manufacture of our product candidates include Cytiva (Global Life Sciences Solutions Operations\nUK Ltd), Wilson Wolf Manufacturing Corporation, Octapharma AG, Sexton Biotechnologies, Miltenyi Biotech, Thermo Fisher Scientific and other suppliers. We cannot be\nsure that these suppliers will remain in business or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that is not interested in continuing to produce\nthese materials for our intended purpose. In addition, the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy, and we may experience delays in\nmeeting demand in the event that we must switch to a new supplier. The time and effort to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs, diversion of resources or\nreduced manufacturing yields, any of which would negatively impact our operating results. Further, we may be unable to enter into agreements with a new supplier on\ncommercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we\ncommercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will\nincur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in, for example:\n● reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n● decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n● injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n● withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n● initiation of investigations by regulators;\n● product recalls, withdrawals or labelling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n● significant costs to defend the resulting litigation;\n● substantial monetary awards paid to clinical trial participants or patients;\n● loss of revenue; and\n● the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold £5.0 million in clinical study liability annual insurance cover for each clinical study, with a per patient limit of £5.0 million, which may not be\nadequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we commence commercialization of our\nproduct candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy\nany liability that may arise.\n46\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulations\nChanges and uncertainties in the tax system in the countries in which we have operations could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of\noperations, and reduce net returns to our shareholders.\nWe conduct business and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions. Our consolidated effective income tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several\nfactors, including: changing tax laws, regulations and treaties, or the interpretation thereof; tax policy initiatives and reforms under consideration (such as those related to the\nOrganization for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s, or OECD, Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, Project, the European Commission’s state aid\ninvestigations and other initiatives); the practices of tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any\nrelated interest or penalties. Such changes may include (but are not limited to) the taxation of operating income, investment income, dividends received or (in the specific\ncontext of withholding tax) dividends paid.\nWe are unable to predict what tax reform may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes, to the\nextent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase the estimated tax liability that we have\nexpensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheets, and otherwise affect our financial position, future results of operations, cash flows in a particular period and overall\nor effective tax rates in the future in countries where we have operations, reduce post-tax returns to our shareholders and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax\ncompliance.\nChanges in our business strategy or operations may result in grant income being repaid to government grant awarding bodies.\nWe have been awarded and received grant income from government agencies with respect to a number of research and development programs totaling £5.6 million\nsince incorporation through December 31, 2023. In some cases, the grant award contains commitments for the business that extend beyond the specific program period. If the\nCompany changes strategy or the nature of its operations, some grant awarding bodies may view this as a breach of the original terms of the grant and all or part of the original\ngrant award may become subject to repayment. In the event of our having to return funds under prior grant awards, the Company may be required to repay up to an aggregate of\n£5.6 million.\nTax authorities may disagree with our positions and conclusions regarding certain tax positions, or may apply existing rules in an unforeseen manner, resulting in\nunanticipated costs, taxes or non-realization of expected benefits.\nA tax authority may disagree with tax positions that we have taken, which could result in increased tax liabilities. For example, Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs, or\nHMRC, the United States Internal Revenue Service, the IRS, or another tax authority could challenge our allocation of income by tax jurisdiction and the amounts paid between\nour affiliated companies pursuant to our intercompany arrangements and transfer pricing policies, including amounts paid with respect to our intellectual property development.\nSimilarly, a tax authority could assert that we are subject to tax in a jurisdiction where we believe we have not established a taxable connection, often referred to as a\n“permanent establishment” under international tax treaties, and such an assertion, if successful, could increase our expected tax liability in one or more jurisdictions.\nA tax authority may take the position that material income tax liabilities, interest and penalties are payable by us, for example where there has been a technical\nviolation of contradictory laws and regulations that are relatively new and have not been subject to extensive review or interpretation, in which case we expect that we might\ncontest such assessment. High-profile companies can be particularly vulnerable to aggressive application of unclear requirements. Many companies must negotiate their tax\nbills with tax inspectors who may demand higher taxes than applicable law appears to provide. Contesting such an assessment may be lengthy and costly and if we were\nunsuccessful in disputing the assessment, the implications could increase our anticipated effective tax rate, where applicable.\nWe may be unable to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments or benefit from favorable UK tax\nlegislation.\nAs a UK incorporated and tax resident entity, we are subject to UK corporate taxation. Due to the nature of our business, we have generated losses since inception and\ntherefore have not paid any UK corporation tax. As of December 31, 2023, we had cumulative carryforward tax trading losses of £11.1 million. Subject to any relevant\nutilization criteria and restrictions (including those that limit the percentage of profits that can be reduced by carried forward losses and those that can restrict the use of carried\nforward losses where there is a change of ownership of more than half of our ordinary shares (including those represented by the ADSs) and a major change in the nature,\nconduct or scale of the trade), we expect these to be eligible for carry forward and utilization against future operating profits arising in the United Kingdom. The use of loss\ncarryforwards in relation to UK profits incurred on or after April 1, 2017 are limited each year to £5.0 million per group plus, broadly, an incremental 50% of UK taxable\nprofits.\nAs a company that carries out extensive research and development activities, we seek to benefit from the UK research and development tax relief programs, being the\nSmall and Medium-sized Enterprises R&D tax relief program, or SME Program, and, to the extent that our projects are grant funded or relate to work subcontracted to us by\nthird parties, the Research and Development Expenditure Credit program, or RDEC Program. Under the SME Program, we may be able to surrender the trading losses that arise\nfrom our qualifying research and development activities for a cash rebate of up to 14.5% of such qualifying research and development expenditures. The majority of our\nresearch, clinical trials management and manufacturing development activities are eligible for inclusion within these tax credit cash rebate claims. We may not be able to\ncontinue to claim payable research and development tax credits in the future if we cease to qualify as a SME, based on size criteria concerning employee headcount, turnover\nand gross assets.\n47\nWe may benefit in the future from the UK’s “patent box” regime, which allows certain profits attributable to revenue from patented products (and other qualifying\nincome) to be taxed at an effective rate of 10% by giving an additional tax deduction. We own several patents which cover our investigational therapies, and accordingly, future\nupfront fees, milestone fees, product revenue and royalties could be eligible for this deduction. When taken in combination with the enhanced relief available on our research\nand development expenditures, we expect a long-term rate of corporation tax lower than the statutory to apply to us. If, however, there are unexpected adverse changes to the\nUK research and development tax credit regime or the “patent box” regime, or for any reason we are unable to qualify for such advantageous tax legislation, or we are unable to\nuse net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments then our business, results of operations and financial condition may\nbe adversely affected. This may impact our ongoing requirement for investment and the timeframes within which additional investment is required.\nFailure to comply with United States health and data protection laws and regulations could lead to enforcement actions, including civil or criminal penalties, private\nlitigation, and adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe and any potential collaborators are subject to data protection laws and regulations, such as laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. In the\nUnited States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state\nconsumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, we may obtain health information\nfrom third parties, including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data, which are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by\nHITECH. To the extent that we act as a business associate to a healthcare provider engaging in electronic transactions, we may also be subject to the privacy and security\nprovisions of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which restricts the use and disclosure of patient-identifiable health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to\nthe privacy and security of patient-identifiable health information, and requires the reporting of certain security breaches to healthcare provider customers with respect to such\ninformation. Additionally, many states have enacted similar laws that may impose more stringent requirements on entities like ours. Depending on the facts and circumstances,\nwe could be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties if we obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-\ncovered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nAdditionally, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and\nprovides new data privacy rights for consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and new operational requirements for companies, which may increase our compliance costs and\npotential liability. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and\nreceive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data\nbreaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial\nregulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact certain of our business activities. The CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy\nlegislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nCompliance with U.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our\nability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in\ngovernment enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal and administrative penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our\noperating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects, employees and other individuals about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain personal information, as\nwell as the providers who share this information with us, may limit our ability to collect, use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy\nrights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend\nand could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nEuropean data collection is governed by restrictive privacy and security regulations governing the use, processing and cross-border transfer of personal information.\nThe collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data (including health data processed in the context of clinical trials) (i) regarding\nindividuals in the EU, and/or (ii) carried out in the context of the activities of our establishment in any EU member state, is subject to the EU General Data Protection\nRegulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, as well as other national data protection legislation in force in relevant member states (including the Data\nProtection Act 2018 in the UK).\nThe GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous additional requirements on companies that process personal data, including imposing special requirements\nin respect of the processing of health and other sensitive data, requiring that consent of individuals to whom the personal data relates is obtained in certain circumstances,\nrequiring additional disclosures to individuals regarding data processing activities, requiring that safeguards are implemented to protect the security and confidentiality of\npersonal data, creating mandatory data breach notification requirements in certain circumstances, and requiring that certain measures (including contractual requirements) are\nput in place when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA, including the United\nStates, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global\nrevenue, whichever is greater. The GDPR provides individuals with various rights in respect of their personal data, including rights of access, erasure, portability, rectification,\nrestriction and objection. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek\njudicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.\n48\nThe GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR. While we have\ntaken steps to comply with the GDPR, and implementing legislation in applicable EU member states, including by seeking to establish appropriate lawful bases for the various\nprocessing activities we carry out as a controller or joint controller, reviewing our security procedures and those of our vendors and collaborators, and entering into data\nprocessing agreements with relevant vendors and collaborators, we cannot be certain that our efforts to achieve and remain in compliance have been, and/or will continue to be,\nfully successful.\nFollowing the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020 and following the end the of the transitional arrangements on December 31, 2020, it is likely that the\ndata protection obligations of the GDPR will continue to apply to UK-based organizations’ processing of personal data in substantially unvaried form, for at least the short term\nthereafter.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations, Managing Growth and Employee Matters\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business.\nBecause of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plan, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and\nmanagement resources. As we expand our activities, there will be additional demands on these resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative,\noperating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including issues relating to our research and development activities and retention\nof experienced scientists, managers and engineers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely\nexecute our business plan. If we are unable to implement these actions in a timely manner, our results may be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees\nWe are heavily dependent on the ongoing employment and involvement of certain key employees in particular our principal executive officers (i) Bryan Kobel, our\nChief Executive Officer and Martin Thorp, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWe anticipate, overtime, a requirement to expand our current personnel, who will be based in the UK, the EU and the USA, potentially very rapidly in order to achieve\nour planned business activities and aims to further engage in clinical trials. Such expansion is dependent on our ability to recruit experienced and suitably trained employees or\nconsultants, and to retain such employees on a long-term basis. Our ability to take our existing pipeline of GD-T cell therapeutics and to meet the demands of our clinical\nprograms may be compromised or delayed if we are unable to recruit sufficient personnel on a timely basis.\nThe loss of key managers and senior scientists could delay our research and development activities. In addition, our ability to compete in the highly competitive\npharmaceutical industry depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, scientific and medical personnel. Many other companies and academic\ninstitutions that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do.\nTherefore, we might not be able to attract or retain these key persons on conditions that are economically acceptable. Moreover, some qualified prospective employees may\nchoose not to work for us due to negative perceptions regarding the therapeutic use of psilocybin or other objections to the therapeutic use of a controlled substance.\nFurthermore, we will need to recruit new managers and qualified scientific personnel to develop our business if we expand into fields that will require additional skills. Our\ninability to attract and retain these key people could prevent us from achieving our objectives and implementing our business strategy, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business and prospects.\nIn addition, certain key academic and scientific personnel play a pivotal role in our collaborative partners’ research and development activities. If any of those key\nacademic and scientific personnel who work on development of our research programs, our investigational GD-T cell therapy and any future therapeutic candidates leave our\ncollaborative partners, the development of our research programs, our investigational GD-T cell therapy and any future therapeutic candidates may be delayed or otherwise\nadversely affected.\n49\nWe will need to grow the size and capabilities of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of March 7, 2024, we have 41 full-time equivalent employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, and as we transition into\noperating as a public company, we will have to add a significant number of additional managerial, operational, financial, and other personnel. Future growth will impose\nsignificant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n● identifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining, and motivating additional employees;\n● managing our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical and regulatory review process for our GD-T therapeutic candidates, while complying with\nour contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and\n● improving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our GD-T therapeutic candidates will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future\ngrowth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time\nto managing these growth activities.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely\naffect our business and our stock price.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly\nand time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We may discover material weaknesses in our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that\nneed improvement from time to time.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes. Management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will\nprevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control\nsystem’s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to\nerror or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company will have been detected.\nPursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our senior management on our internal control\nover financial reporting. However, while we remain an EGC we are not required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our\nindependent registered public accounting firm (Section 404(b)). To prepare for eventual compliance with Section 404(b), once we no longer qualify as an EGC, we are engaged\nin a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate\ninternal resources, potentially engage outside consultants, adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue\nsteps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement\nprocess for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the\nfinancial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, if we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis,\ninvestors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of either of our ADSs or Warrants, or both, to decline and make\nit more difficult for us to finance our operations and growth.\nThe Company notes that the auditors identified that the Company experienced difficulty in the accounting for complex financial instruments and leases, and the\nCompany lacked adequate internal control over the account and assessment of complex financial instruments following control deficiencies which they believed constituted a\nmaterial weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. The Company recognizes this error as a material weakness and has\nestablished controls to support assessment and review of accounting for complex financial instruments and leases.\nA pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may materially and adversely affect our business, including our preclinical\nstudies, clinical trials, third parties on whom we rely, our supply chain, our ability to raise capital, our ability to conduct regular business and our financial results.\nWe are subject to risks related to public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues throughout the world. The pandemic and\npolicies and regulations implemented by governments in response to the pandemic, often directing businesses and governmental agencies to cease non-essential operations at\nphysical locations, prohibiting certain nonessential gatherings and ceasing non-essential travel have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and\ncommerce, as worker shortages have occurred, supply chains have been disrupted, facilities and production have been suspended, and demand for certain goods and services,\nsuch as medical service and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. The full extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately\nimpact our business, preclinical trials and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new\ninformation which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. Global health concerns, such as\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we or the third parties with whom we engage operate.\n50\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including\nflexibility for employees to work remotely where appropriate, suspending all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees and discouraging employee attendance at\nindustry events and in-person work-related meetings, all of which could negatively affect our business. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our preclinical\nstudies or clinical trial operations, our supply chain and manufacturing and our office-based business operations, will depend on future developments, which are highly\nuncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the pandemic, the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the effectiveness of actions to contain and\ntreat coronavirus.\nWhile we are working closely with our third-party manufacturers, distributors and other partners to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential\ndisruptions to current and any future therapeutic candidates as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of\ntime, we expect there will be significant and material disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of current and any\nfuture therapeutic candidates. Any such supply disruptions would adversely impact our ability to generate sales of and revenue from our approved products and our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also affect employees of third-party CROs located in affected geographies that we rely upon to carry out our clinical trials. As COVID-\n19 continues to be present and spread around the globe, we may experience additional disruptions that could severely impact our business and clinical trials, including:\n● delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n● delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n● diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of sites or facilities serving as our clinical trial sites and staff supporting\nthe conduct of our clinical trials, including our trained therapists, or absenteeism due to the COVID-19 pandemic that reduces site resources;\n● interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal, state or national\ngovernments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the integrity of clinical trial\ndata;\n● risk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will acquire COVID-19 while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial, including\nby increasing the number of observed adverse events or patient withdrawals from our trials;\n● limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on conducting our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the\ndesire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n● delays in receiving authorizations from regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n● delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials;\n● interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials, such as the cell therapy used in our clinical trials;\n● changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which\nmay result in unexpected costs, or the discontinuation of the clinical trials altogether;\n● interruptions or delays in preclinical studies due to restricted or limited operations at research and development laboratory facilities;\n● delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced\nfurlough of government employees; and\n● refusal of the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA or the other regulatory bodies to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies outside the United States or the EU or\nother relevant local geography.\n51\nAny negative impact the COVID-19 pandemic has on patient enrolment or treatment or the development of our investigational cell therapies and any future therapeutic\ncandidates could cause costly delays to clinical trial activities, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our investigational\ncell therapies and any future therapeutic candidates, if approved, increase our operating expenses, and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant volatility in public equity markets and disruptions to the United States and global economies. This increased\nvolatility and economic dislocation may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all. We cannot currently predict the scope and severity of any\npotential business shutdowns or disruptions. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, however, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our\nability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on\nour business and our results of operations and financial conditions. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also\nheighten many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those relating to the timing and completion of our clinical trials and our ability to obtain future\nfinancing.\nOur current operations are headquartered in one location, and we or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by unplanned natural disasters, as\nwell as occurrences of civil unrest, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster, including earthquakes,\noutbreak of disease or other natural disasters.\nOur current business operations are headquartered and principally located in our offices and laboratories in Glasgow, UK. Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire,\nexplosion, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or man-made accidents or incidents, including\nevents of civil unrest that result in us being unable to fully utilize our facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, may have a material\nand adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions.\nLoss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of our investigational GD-T cell therapy or any future therapeutic candidates or\ninterruption of our business operations.\nThe disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial\nexpenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, could have a material adverse effect on our business. As part of our risk\nmanagement policy, we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business, but in the final result may not be sufficient to satisfy any\ndamages and losses.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our clinical development programs and the diseases our investigational GD-T cell therapy or any future\ntherapeutic candidates are being developed to treat, and we may use appropriate social media in connection with our commercialization efforts of our investigational GD-T cell\ntherapy following approval of our GD-T cell therapy or any future therapeutic candidates, if any. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve,\nand regulations and regulatory guidance relating to such use are evolving and not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations\napplicable to our business, resulting in potential regulatory actions against us, along with the potential for litigation related to certain prohibited activities. For example, patients\nmay use social media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing clinical trial or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that\ntrial enrolment may be adversely impacted, we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations, or that we may not be able to defend our\nbusiness or the public’s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our\ninvestigational GD-T cell therapy or any future therapeutic candidates. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or\ncomments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability,\nface regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we or our licensors are unable to protect our/their intellectual property, then our financial condition, results of operations and the value of our drug technology and\nproduct candidates could be adversely affected.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business, and our ability to compete effectively with other companies is dependent upon the proprietary nature\nof our drug technologies and product candidates. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and\nstrengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. Our success will depend\nin part on the ability of TCB and our licensors to obtain, to maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and to enforce patent protection for the licensed\nintellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured rights. We, and our licensors, may not successfully prosecute or continue to prosecute the patent\napplications which we have licensed. Even if patents are issued in respect of these patent applications, TCB or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine\nnot to pursue litigation against entities that are infringing upon these patents, or may pursue such enforcement less aggressively than we ordinarily would for our own patents.\nWithout adequate protection for the intellectual property that we own or license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could\nunfavorably affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. Even if issued, patents may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could\nlimit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products.\n52\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement or challenges to the validity of our patents would require us to use resources to protect our rights and\nmay prevent or delay our development, regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates.\nIf we are the target of claims by third parties asserting that our product candidates and products or intellectual property infringe upon the rights of others we may be\nforced to incur substantial expenses or divert substantial employee resources from our current business endeavors. If successful, those claims could result in our having to pay\nsubstantial damages or could prevent us from developing one or more product candidates or commercializing a product. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought\nagainst us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product candidate or product that is the subject\nof the suit.\nIf we or our collaborators experience patent infringement claims, or if we elect to avoid potential claims others may be able to assert, we or our collaborators may\nchoose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third-party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be\navailable on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access\nto the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result\nof actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly. The\ncost to us of any litigation or other proceeding, regardless of its merit, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs\nof such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their having greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of\npatent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Intellectual property litigation and other proceedings\nmay, regardless of their merit, also absorb significant management time and employee resources.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our GD-T cell technologies and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not\nsufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and biologics similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our\ntechnology and product candidates may be impaired.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other countries with respect to our\nproduct candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications related to our technology and product candidates in the major pharmaceutical\nmarkets, including the United States, major countries in Europe and Japan. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our\ntechnologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage that we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability.\nTo protect our proprietary positions, we file patent applications related to our novel technologies and product candidates that are important to our business. The patent\napplication and prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable\ncost or in a timely manner. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection. It is possible that\ndefects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship,\nclaim scope or patent term adjustments. If any current or future licensors or licensees are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or\nenforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using and selling competing products.\nIf there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and unenforceable. Moreover, our\ncompetitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third\nparties.\nPatent applications are generally in the form of composition of matter or method patents. A composition of matter (COM) patent protects an actual drug molecule or\nengineered cell or other therapeutic agent and will be infringed by a third party making any use of the protected composition. COM patents provide de-facto protection for any\nand all uses of the protected composition and are generally held to be the strongest and most valuable form of patent protection. Method patents protect, for example, a method\nof manufacturing a product or a method of using it. They can be valuable but typically are more limited in scope than COM patents, particularly method of use patents which\nonly protect a particular application of a product. Where our patent applications are limited in their scope, such as a patent protecting the method of use, such patent rights could\nbe compromised and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using and selling competing products.\n53\nProsecution of our owned and in-licensed patent portfolio is at a relatively early stage in some instances. This status of these patent rights is discussed above.. Neither\npriority applications nor PCT applications can themselves give rise to issued patents. Rather, protection for the inventions disclosed in these applications must be further\npursued by applicable deadlines via applications that are subject to examination. As applicable deadlines for the priority and PCT applications become due, we will need to\ndecide whether to and in which countries or jurisdictions to pursue patent protection for the various inventions claimed in these applications, and we will only have the\nopportunity to pursue and obtain patents in those jurisdictions where we pursue protection.\nIt is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. The patent\napplications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our current and future product candidates in the countries in which we pursue\npatent protection. Our patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless, and until, a patent issues from\nsuch applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology.\nIf the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our development programs and product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of\nprotection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our current and future product candidates, it could threaten our ability to commercialize our product\ncandidates. Any such outcome could have a negative effect on our business.\nPatent and other intellectual property rights may not be upheld, in which case we will suffer a loss of our intellectual property position and the value of our assets.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws\nof the various jurisdictions in which we pursue patents may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the protections offered by\nlaws of different countries vary. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in many\njurisdictions. In addition, the determination of patent rights with respect to pharmaceutical technologies, such as our cell technologies, commonly involves complex legal and\nfactual questions, which has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent\nrights, whether owned or in-licensed, are highly uncertain. Furthermore, the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings that may be\nbrought by or against us related to our patent rights may change as the related patent and intellectual property laws change over time. Additionally, in the United States, one of\nthe jurisdictions in which we purse patent protection, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years either narrowing the scope of patent protection\navailable in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents\nin the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S.\nfederal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain patents or to enforce any\npatents that we might obtain in the future.\nWe may be unaware of the rights of others which may ultimately be used to limit our intellectual property rights.\nWe may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our current and future product candidates. Publications of discoveries in the\nscientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in many jurisdictions typically are not published until 18 months or more after filing, or in\nsome cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that\nwe or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Similarly, should we own or in-license any patents or patent applications in the future, we may\nnot be certain that we or the applicable licensor were the first to file for patent protection for the inventions claimed in such patents or patent applications. As a result, the\nissuance, scope, validity and commercial value of our patent rights cannot be predicted with any certainty. Moreover, in the United States, we may be subject to a third-party\npre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, re-examination, inter partes review or\ninterference proceedings, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission,\nproceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or product candidates and compete\ndirectly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights, which could significantly\nharm our business and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard\nas our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we try to ensure that our employees\ndo not use the proprietary information or know-how of third parties in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise\nused intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee’s former employer. We may also in the future be subject to claims that\nwe have caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these potential\nclaims.\n54\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements\nassigning such intellectual property to us, such employees and contractors may breach the agreement and claim the developed intellectual property as their own.\nIf we fail in defending any the claims we have made, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A court\ncould prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade\nsecrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial\ncosts and could be a distraction to management. In addition, any litigation or threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent\nservice providers. Moreover, a loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products.\nTechnologies and other proprietary rights for which we seek patent protection may not be obtained, which would potentially limit the value of our intellectual property.\nOur pending and future patent applications, whether owned or in-licensed, may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or product candidates, in\nwhole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not\nissue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives, prevent competitors\nfrom competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents, should they issue,\nby developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. Our competitors may seek approval to market their own products similar to or\notherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend and/or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In\nany of these types of proceedings, a court or other agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid and/or unenforceable.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts\nor patent offices in the jurisdictions in which we have filed for patent protection. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being\nnarrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and\nproducts, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. In addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and\nregulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our owned or in-licensed patent rights and other intellectual property.\nWe generally enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored\nresearchers and other advisors. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. For example, disputes may\narise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our technology and product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against\nthese and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. The owners of intellectual property in-licensed to us could also face such claims. If we or our licensors fail in\ndefending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable\nintellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we or our licensors are successful in defending against such claims,\nlitigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could\nsignificantly harm our business.\nWe believe that we have proprietary and modular T cell programming technology that does not infringe the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third\nparties. Numerous third-party U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents exist in the area of biotechnology, including in the area of programmed T cell therapies. Some are patents held\nby our competitors. If any third-party patents cover our product candidates or technologies, we may not be free to manufacture or commercialize our product candidates as\nplanned.\n55\nThere is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with,\nlitigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technology or product candidates, including interference proceedings before\nthe relevant patent office. Intellectual property disputes arise in a number of areas including with respect to patents, use of other proprietary rights and the contractual terms of\nlicense arrangements. Third parties may assert claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights and claims may also come from competitors against\nwhom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in\nadvance. Other parties may allege that our product candidates or the use of our technologies infringes patent claims or other intellectual property rights held by them or that we\nare employing their proprietary technology without authorization. As we continue to develop and, if approved, commercialize our current and future product candidates,\ncompetitors may claim that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights as part of business strategies designed to impede our successful commercialization. There\nare and may in the future be additional third-party patents or patent applications with claims to, for example, materials, compositions, formulations, methods of manufacture or\nmethods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of any one or more of our product candidates.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or\ncommercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required or may choose to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the\ninfringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies\nlicensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A\nfinding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. Claims that we have\nmisappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative effect on our business. Even if successful, the defense of any claim of\ninfringement or misappropriation is time-consuming, expensive and diverts the attention of our management from our ongoing business operations.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property rights, including patent rights, which are important or necessary to the development or manufacture of our product\ncandidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be\nrequired to obtain a license from these third parties. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and we could be forced to accept\nunfavorable contractual terms. If we are unable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, if issued, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be\nrequired to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. Any claims we\nassert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, trademarks, copyrights or other\nintellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part,\nand that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will\nconstrue the patent’s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover\nthe invention. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors, and\nmay curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a\ncourt may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights\nto the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nIn any infringement litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of\ndiscovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during\nlitigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years\nbefore they are concluded. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater\nfinancial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the\ndiversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we\nmay not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation\nand continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a negative impact on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\n56\nAny trademarks we may obtain may be infringed or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe expect to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish any of our product candidates that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors.\nWhile we have a corporate trademark, we have not yet selected trademarks for our product candidates and have not yet begun the process of applying to register trademarks for\nour product candidates. Once we select trademarks and apply to register them, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may oppose our trademark\napplications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which\ncould result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we\nmay not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIn addition, any proprietary name we propose to use with our clinical-stage product candidates or any other product candidate in the United States must be approved by\nthe FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an\nevaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend\nsignificant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable proprietary product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of\nthird parties and be acceptable to the FDA.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent and trademark protection for our product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other\nproprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with\nparties who have access to them, such as our employees, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment\nagreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our\ntrade secrets. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our\nintellectual property will be effective. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or\nmisappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the jurisdiction in which we operate or\nintend to operate are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.\nMoreover, our competitors may independently develop knowledge, methods and know-how equivalent to our trade secrets. Competitors could purchase our products\nand replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts for technologies on which we do not have patent protection. If any of our trade\nsecrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using\nthat technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position\nwould be harmed.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by\ngovernmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the patent offices and patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent to maintain the\npatents that have been issued. Additionally, these offices and agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions\nduring the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules,\nthere are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the\nrelevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within\nprescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent\napplications covering our products or product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would harm our business. In addition, to the extent that we\nhave responsibility for taking any action related to the prosecution or maintenance of patents or patent application in-licensed from a third party, any failure on our part to\nmaintain the in-licensed rights could jeopardize our rights under the relevant license and may expose us to liability.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license our development or commercialization rights to products or drug technologies from third\nparties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe hold a license from UCL Business plc (“UCLB”) for its technology related to co-stimulatory CAR-T in GD-T cells. This is in addition to the intellectual property\nthat we own. Our license with UCLB is for a single CAR-T binder, where we pay an annual license fee, certain performance-based milestone payments and a single-digit\nroyalty on sales arising from use of that binder together with certain cumulative sales-based milestone payments. Through December 31, 2023 we have paid UCLB\napproximately $0.65 million (taking into consideration fluctuation in exchange rates) in license fee payments. Furthermore, the Company has a duty not to breach terms of the\nlicense agreement. If we fail to meet specific obligations, the licensor will have the right to terminate the applicable license or modify certain terms of the license agreement.\nRoyalty provisions cease upon termination or upon expiry of the license which occurs, on a country-by-country basis, upon the later of the tenth (10th) anniversary of the first\ncommercial sale of a licensed product or the lapse, expiry, or revocation of all patents.\n57\nRisks Related Ownership of Our ADSs and Warrants\nControl by a limited number of shareholders may limit the ability of investors to influence the outcome of director elections and other transactions requiring shareholder\napproval.\nAs of March 22, 2024, we had outstanding warrants to acquire 1,956,918 ADSs, and share options to purchase 920,230 ADSs. A significant number of such warrants\nhave exercise prices above our ADSs’ recent trading prices, but the holders have the right, in certain circumstances, to effect a cashless exercise of such warrants. If a\nsignificant number of such warrants and share options are exercised by the holders, such persons together, along with several other long term significant shareholders, may have\ninfluence over corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including the following actions:\n● to elect our directors;\n● to amend or prevent amendment of our articles of association;\n● to effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n● to influence the outcome of any other matter submitted to our shareholders for vote.\nThese persons’ share ownership or warrant ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our\ncompany, which in turn could reduce the market price of our ADSs and Warrants or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price of our ADSs and\nWarrants.\nIf we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market or Nasdaq, our ADSs could be delisted from trading, which would decrease the\nliquidity of our ADSs and our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur ADSs are currently listed for quotation on The Nasdaq Capital Market. We are required to meet specified financial requirements in order to maintain our listing on\nthe Nasdaq Capital Market. These requirements include maintaining a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share for our ADSs, which is referred to as the Bid Price Rule,\nand maintaining a minimum market value of listed securities, or the MVLS, of $35,000,000. On July 12 and 15, 2022, we received deficiency letters from the Listings\nQualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market notifying that we were not in compliance with the Bid Price Rule and the MVLS, respectively. On December 6, 2022,\nwe received written notification from the listing qualifications staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company regained compliance with the\nBid Price Rule. On January 12, 2023, we received written notification from the listing qualifications staff of the Nasdaq indicating that we have not regained compliance with\nthe MVLS and that our securities would be subject to delisting unless we timely request a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”.) On March 9, 2023 the\nCompany presented a formal plan to regain compliance to the Panel. On March 17, 2023, the Company announced that the TC BioPharm (Holdings) plc has been granted a\nformal extension until June 30, 2023, to regain compliance under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) or its alternative criteria. On July 27, 2023, the Company received a letter,\ndated July 26, 2023 (the “Letter”) from Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Panel has concluded that the Company has regained compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing\nrequirements. The Letter stated that, pursuant to Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(A), the Company will be subject to a Panel Monitor for a period of one year from the date of the Letter.\nIf, within that one-year monitoring period, the Listing Qualifications staff (the “Staff”) finds the Company again out of compliance with any continued listing requirement,\nnotwithstanding Rule 5810(c)(2), the Company will not be permitted to provide the Staff with a plan of compliance with respect to any deficiency and the Staff will not be\npermitted to grant additional time for the Company to regain compliance with respect to any deficiency, nor will the Company be afforded an applicable cure or compliance\nperiod. Instead, the Staff will issue a Delist Determination Letter and the Company will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Panel or a newly convened\nHearings Panel if the initial Panel is unavailable.\nOn June 22, 2023, we received a written notification from Nasdaq indicating that the minimum closing bid price per share for our ADSs was below $1.00 for a period\nof 30 consecutive business days and that we did not meet the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5810(c)(3)(A), we had a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until December 19, 2023 (the “Compliance Period”), to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid\nprice requirement. If at any time during the Compliance Period, the closing bid price per share of our ADSs is at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days,\nNasdaq will provide us with a written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. On December 28, 2023, we received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that we\nhad not regained compliance with the rule and are not eligible for a second 180 day period. On January 2, 2024, we received written confirmation from Nasdaq that it has\ndetermined that for the last 10 consecutive business days, from December 15, 2023 to December 29, 2023, the closing bid price of our securities was at $1.00 per share or\ngreater. Accordingly, we regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and the matter was closed. If we are deficient in maintaining the necessary listing requirements in\nthe future, our common stock may be delisted. If our common stock is delisted, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained and the market price of\nour common stock could decline. Delisting of our common stock could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital through the public or private sale of equity\nsecurities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also\nhave other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. For\nthese reasons and others, delisting would adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume and price of our common stock, causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and\nhaving an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not intend to list any of our securities on any public securities exchange in the United Kingdom. This may limit the information available to our security holders.\nOur ordinary shares and public warrants are not listed in the United Kingdom. As a result, we are not, and will not be, subject to the reporting and other requirements\nof companies listed on a securities exchange in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, there may be less publicly available information concerning our company than there would\nbe if we were a public company listed in the United Kingdom, notwithstanding our reporting under the SEC rules.\nAn active and liquid market for the ADSs and/or public warrants may fail to continue, which could harm the market price of the ADSs and/or Warrants, and an investor\nmay not be able to resell their ADSs and/ or warrants at or above the acquisition price.\nAn active public trading market for the ADSs and public warrants on the United States securities markets may not continue or be sustained. In the absence of an active\ntrading market for the ADSs and/or warrants, investors may not be able to sell their ADSs and warrants at or above the price they paid for their securities or at the time when\nthey would like to sell.\n58\nThe market price of the ADSs and public warrants is volatile and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe price of the securities of publicly traded emerging pharmaceutical and drug discovery and development companies has been highly volatile and is likely to remain\nhighly volatile in the future. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their ADSs and warrants at or above the purchase price or when they want to sell their\nsecurities. The market price of the ADSs and Warrants may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including the following:\n● positive or negative results of testing and clinical trials by us, strategic partners or competitors;\n● delays in entering into strategic relationships with respect to development or commercialization of our investigational GD-T cell therapy or any future therapeutic\ncandidates;\n● entry into strategic relationships on terms that are not deemed to be favorable to us;\n● technological innovations or commercial therapeutic introductions by competitors;\n● changes in government regulations and healthcare payment systems;\n● developments concerning proprietary rights, including patent and litigation matters;\n● public concern relating to the commercial value or safety of any of our investigational GD-T cell therapy or any future therapeutic candidates;\n● negative publicity or public perception of the use of GD-T cells as a treatment therapy;\n● financing or other corporate transactions;\n● publication of research reports or comments by securities or industry analysts;\n● the trading volume of the ADSs and warrants on Nasdaq;\n● sales of our ordinary shares, including through deposit of additional ordinary shares with the depositary for the ADSs, by us, members of our senior management and\ndirectors or our shareholders or the anticipation that such sales may occur in the future;\n● general market conditions in the pharmaceutical industry or in the economy as a whole;\n● general economic, political, and market conditions and overall market volatility in the United States or the UK as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics\nor similar events; and\n● other events and factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our securities to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating\nperformance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their ADSs and warrants and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of the ADSs and warrants. In\naddition, the stock market in general, and pharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or\ndisproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.\nThe public warrants are speculative in nature.\nThe public warrants merely represent the right to acquire our ordinary shares at a fixed cash price, for a limited period of time. If the warrants are not exercised before\nthey expire, in six years from date of issue, the warrants will never provide any value to the holder thereof. It is usual that the price of a warrant in the public market is more\nvolatile than that of the corresponding shares for which it is exercisable. Therefore, investors should expect the price of a warrant to be fluctuate to a greater degree than our\nADSs, and correspondingly be more speculative.\nHolders of our public and private warrants will not have any rights of the holders of ordinary shares until such warrants are exercised.\nThe public and private warrants do not confer any of the rights afforded to the holders of our ordinary shares, even those ordinary shares held through ADSs, such as\nvoting rights or the right to receive dividends, but rather represent the right to acquire ordinary shares at a fixed price.\n59\nWe have a significant number of public warrants outstanding, with fifty warrants to purchase one ADS, which may be exercised at a current cash exercise price of $500.00\nper ADS. There is no assurance that they will be exercised and that they will provide funding for the Company.\nAs at March 8, 2024, there were approximately 16,166,260 public warrants outstanding where fifty of each warrant are exercisable for one ordinary share. Following\nthe ratio change twenty ordinary shares can be dematerialized into one ADS. For the public Warrants to be exercised on a cash basis, we must maintain an effective registration\nstatement with the SEC at the time of their exercise. It is not expected that any of the derivative securities will be exercised for cash unless the price of an ADS in the market is\nsubstantially above the then exercise price. There can be no assurance that our ADS price will be sufficiently high on a sustained basis to encourage warrant holders to exercise\ntheir derivative securities.\nThe public warrants have a number of restrictions and reset provisions which may limit aspects of our operations and capital raising.\nThe public warrant terms have restrictions on our ability to issue ordinary shares in a number of situations. For example, for the period during which the lock up\nagreements are in place, we have limits on our ability to issue ordinary shares under our incentive plans. Another restriction, one on our capital raising, is an exercise price reset\nprovision; if we issue any ordinary shares, including instruments convertible into ordinary shares, at a per share price or conversion price less than the exercise price, the then\nthe exercise price of the warrants will be reduced to the lower issue price permanently. The warrants have anti-dilution provisions including those for recapitalization\ntransactions such as a reverse stock split, stock dividend and forward stock split, and protective provisions in the event of a rights offering, cash or asset dividend, and\nfundamental transactions consummated by the company where it is not the survivor. The warrant has buy-in protection and cash penalties if we do not issue the securities\nunderlying them on a timely basis. The six-year term and number of warrants in combination with the registration obligation will be an overhang on the market while the\nwarrants are outstanding. This overhang may limit our ability to raise capital when needed at a price that represents the value of the company. The warrants do not have a\nredemption provision by which we can either encourage their exercise or terminate the warrants.\nWe have a significant number of private, Series E Warrants outstanding each warrant to purchase one ADS, which may be exercised at a current cash exercise price of\n£1.5814 per ADS. There is no assurance that they will be exercised and that they will provide funding for the Company.\nAs at March 22, 2024, there were approximately 1,750,000 private Series E warrants with an exercise price of £1.5814, each of which currently is exercisable for 20\nordinary shares. For these private Warrants to be exercised on a cash basis, we must maintain an effective registration statement with the SEC at the time of their exercise. It is\nnot expected that any of the derivative securities will be exercised for cash unless the price of an ADS in the market is substantially above the then exercise price. There can be\nno assurance that our ADS price will be sufficiently high on a sustained basis to encourage warrant holders to exercise their derivative securities, such as the private warrants.\nThe private warrants have a number of restrictions and reset provisions which may limit aspects of our operations and capital raising.\nThe private warrant terms have restrictions on our ability to issue ordinary shares in a number of situations. For example, for the period during which the lock up\nagreements are in place, we have limits on our ability to issue ordinary shares. The private warrants have anti-dilution provisions including those for recapitalization transactions\nsuch as a reverse stock split, stock dividend and forward stock split, and protective provisions in the event of a rights offering, cash or asset dividend, and fundamental\ntransactions consummated by the company where it is not the survivor. The private warrants have buy-in protection and cash penalties if we do not issue the securities\nunderlying them on a timely basis. The term and number of warrants in combination with the registration obligation will be an overhang on the market while the private warrants\nare outstanding. This overhang may limit our ability to raise capital when needed at a price that represents the value of the company. The private warrants do not have a\nredemption provision by which we can either encourage their exercise or terminate the private Warrants.\n60\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a Scottish public company listed in the U.S., and our board of directors is required to devote substantial time to\ncompliance requirements and corporate governance practices.\nAs a Scottish public company listed in the U.S., we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations\nimpose various requirements on foreign reporting public companies, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate\ngovernance practices. Our board of directors, management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and\nregulations increase our annual legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and\nregulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and\nretain qualified members of our board of directors.\nHowever, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in\npractice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and\nhigher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nPursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our board of directors on our internal control over financial\nreporting. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we are not required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by\nour independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404(b) within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and\nevaluate our internal controls over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially\nengage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control\nprocesses as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective as required\nby Section 404. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our\nfinancial statements.\nWe are implementing appropriate accounting policies, processes and controls to comply with our expected expansion in scale of operations and with Section 404. These\nactivities include identifying and recruiting additional individuals with requisite expertise to assist in implementation activities designed to strengthen our internal control over\nfinancial reporting to avoid future control deficiencies and initiating the design and implementation of improvements to our financial control environment to address our future\nneeds. However, we cannot give assurance that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we plan to take in the future, will be sufficient to prevent or avoid potential\nfuture additional material weaknesses in our controls.\nIf we are unsuccessful in building an appropriate accounting infrastructure, we may not be able to prepare and disclose, in a timely manner, our financial statements\nand other required disclosures, or comply with existing or new reporting requirements. Any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in\nsanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from Nasdaq or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports\nor prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any of the foregoing\noccurrences, should they come to pass, could negatively impact the public perception of our company, which could have a negative impact on the price of our publicly traded\nsecurities or our ability to sell other securities.\nWe are an “emerging growth company” under the federal securities laws and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth\ncompanies will make our securities less attractive to investors.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting\nrequirements that are applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor\nattestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of\nholding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if\ninvestors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our\nindustry if they believe that our reporting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If some investors, including persons considering an investment in the\ncompany, find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our public securities, and the prices of these securities may be more volatile.\n61\nWe will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1.07 billion (or equivalent), if we\nissue more than $1 billion (or equivalent) in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700\nmillion (or equivalent) as of any June 30.\nHolders of our ordinary shares will have their rights as a shareholder governed by Scottish law, and those rights differ from the rights of shareholders under U.S. law.\nWe are a public limited company under the laws of Scotland and United Kingdom. Therefore, the rights of holders of our ordinary shares, including those represented\nby ADSs, are governed by the corporate law of Scotland and the United Kingdom and by our memorandum of association and articles. The statutory framework that governs the\nCompany is the Companies Act 2006 which is a UK-wide act and references to the “UK Law” are to UK-wide legislation. These rights differ from the typical rights of\nshareholders in U.S. corporations. In certain cases, facts that, under U.S. law, would entitle a shareholder in a U.S. corporation to claim damages may not give rise to a cause of\naction or claim for damages under Scottish law. For example, the rights of shareholders to bring proceedings against the Company or against our directors or officers in relation\nto public statements are more limited under Scottish law and UK Law than under the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws.\nInvestors may face difficulties in protecting their interests, and their ability to protect their rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited, because we are\nincorporated outside the United States, conduct most of our operations outside the United States, and most of our directors and senior management reside outside the\nUnited States.\nWe are incorporated and have our registered office in, and are currently existing under the laws of, Scotland. In addition, most of our tangible assets are located, and\nmost of our senior management and certain of our directors reside, outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible to serve process within the United States on\ncertain directors or us or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against such directors or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.\nThe United States and the UK do not currently have a treaty providing for recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and\ncommercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment of money given by a court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws,\nwould not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the UK. In addition, uncertainty exists as to whether courts of Scotland would entertain original actions brought in\nScotland against us or our directors or senior management predicated upon the securities laws of the U.S. or any state in the U.S. Any final and conclusive monetary judgment\nfor a definite sum obtained against us in U.S. courts would be treated by the courts of Scotland as a cause of action in itself and sued upon as a debt at common law so that no\nretrial of the issues would be necessary, provided that certain requirements are met.\nWhether these requirements are met in respect of a judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws, including whether the award of\nmonetary damages under such laws would constitute a penalty, is subject to determination by the court making such decision. If the courts of Scotland give a judgment for the\nsum payable under a U.S. judgment, the Scottish judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the courts of\nScotland discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement.\nAs a result, U.S. investors may not be able to enforce against us or certain of our directors any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters,\nincluding judgments under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nAs a Scottish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions will require shareholder approval, which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure.\nScottish law provides that a board of directors may only allot shares (or grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares) with the prior authorization\nof shareholders, such authorization stating the aggregate nominal amount of shares that it covers and being valid for a maximum period of five years, each as specified in the\narticles of association or relevant ordinary resolution passed by shareholders at a general meeting. Once allotted, the board of directors are free to issue the shares without\nfurther shareholder approval. The authority from our shareholders to allot additional shares for a period of five years from January 14, 2022 was included in the ordinary\nresolution passed by our shareholders on January 14, 2022, which authorization will need to be renewed upon expiration (i.e., at least every five years) but may be sought more\nfrequently for additional five-year terms (or any shorter period).\nScottish law also generally provides shareholders with pre-emptive rights when new shares are issued for cash. However, it is possible for the articles of association, or\nfor shareholders to pass a special resolution at a general meeting, being a resolution passed by the members (or of a class of members) of a company by a majority of not less\nthan 75%, to disapply pre-emptive rights. Such a disapplication of pre-emptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years from the date of adoption of the articles\nof association, if the disapplication is contained in the articles of association, but not longer than the duration of the authority to allot shares to which this disapplication relates\nor from the date of the shareholder special resolution, if the disapplication is by shareholder special resolution. In either case, this disapplication would need to be renewed by\nour shareholders upon its expiration (i.e., at least every five years). Such authority from our shareholders to disapply pre-emptive rights for a period of five years was included in\nthe special resolution passed by our shareholders on, January 14, 2022, which disapplication will need to be renewed upon expiration (i.e., at least every five years) to remain\neffective, but may be sought more frequently for additional five-year terms (or any shorter period).\n62\nScottish law also generally prohibits a public company from repurchasing its own shares without the prior approval of shareholders by ordinary resolution, being a\nresolution passed by a simple majority of votes cast, and other formalities. Such approval may be for a maximum period of up to five years.\nOur business and results of operations may be negatively impacted by the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.\nThe UK withdrew from the EU effective on January 31, 2020, and the transition period ended on December 31, 2020, which we refer to as Brexit. The future\nregulations that will apply in the UK following the transition period (including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, data\nprotection laws, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations medicine licensing and regulations, immigration laws and employment laws),\nhave yet to be fully addressed and continue to be in transition, subject to change. The overall lack of clarity on future UK laws and regulations and their interaction with the EU\nlaws and regulations may negatively impact foreign direct investment in the UK, increase costs, depress economic activity and restrict access to capital. As we are headquartered\nin the UK and have operations and clinical trials in the United Kingdom and EU, it is possible that Brexit may impact some or all of our current operations and otherwise how\nwe conduct business. For example, Brexit may impact our ability to freely move employees from our headquarters in the UK to other locations in Europe, and it may impact the\nability of European therapists to move freely to the UK in order to complete part of their training or work on our clinical trials there.\nThe long-term effects of Brexit will depend in part on the agreements the UK made during the Brexit transition period and thereafter to retain access to markets in the\nEU. The Brexit withdrawal from the EU is unprecedented, and it is unclear how the UK’s access to the European single market for goods, capital, services and labor within the\nEU, or single market, and the wider commercial, legal and regulatory environment, will impact our current and future operations (including business activities conducted by\nthird parties and contract manufacturers on our behalf) and clinical activities in the UK In addition to the foregoing, our UK operations support our current and future operations\nand clinical activities in the EU and European Economic Area, or EEA, and these operations and clinical activities could be disrupted by Brexit.\nWe may also face new regulatory costs and challenges that could have an adverse effect on our operations as a result of Brexit. The UK could lose the benefits of\nglobal trade agreements negotiated by the EU on behalf of its member states, which may result in increased trade barriers that could make our doing business in the EU and the\nEEA more difficult. Since the regulatory framework in the UK covering quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic substances, clinical trials, marketing authorization,\ncommercial sales and distribution of therapeutic substances is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime with\nrespect to the approval of our GD-T cell therapy or any future therapeutic candidates in the UK. For instance, in November 2017, EU member states voted to move the EMA,\nthe EU’s regulatory body, from London to Amsterdam. Operations in Amsterdam commenced in March 2019, and the move itself may cause significant disruption to the\nregulatory approval process in Europe. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for therapeutic candidates and therapies in the UK. Any\ndelay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any regulatory approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would delay or prevent us from commercializing our investigational\nGD-T cell therapy or future therapeutic candidates in the UK and/or the EU and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. We may be forced\nto restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the UK and/or EU for GD-T cell therapy or any future therapeutic candidates, which could significantly and materially\nharm our business.\nWe expect that Brexit, in the near and middle term will lead to certain legal uncertainties and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines\nwhich EU laws to replicate or replace, including those related to data privacy and the regulation of medicinal products, as described above. Any of these effects of Brexit, and\nothers we cannot anticipate, could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nOur business may be subject to risks related to possible Scottish independence from the UK\nThe possibility of Scottish independence from the UK creates a range of uncertainties for Scotland based business in general, which would require careful assessment\nby the board of directors and management as political events develop. There could be changes in currency, taxation, general legislation, regulations and trading arrangements\nand agreements, together with economic prospects more generally. It is not possible to predict the effect of Scottish independence if it were to occur and the changes introduced\ncould have only limited effect on the business, be beneficial to the business or could have a material adverse effect on the business’ revenue, financial condition, profitability,\nprospects and results of operations.\nA transfer of ordinary shares, other than one effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests, such as through our ADS program, may be subject to United\nKingdom stamp duty.\nThe transfer of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests through our ADS program will generally not be subject to United Kingdom\nstamp duty. However, if an investor holds its ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through the ADS program, any transfer of ordinary shares (including into the ADS\nprogram with a view to trading) would be likely to be subject to United Kingdom stamp duty currently at the rate of 1.5% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of\nthe shares acquired.\n63\nGeneral Risk Factors\nExchange rate fluctuations may materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, the financial reporting of our assets, earnings and cash flows are influenced by movements in exchange rates of\nseveral currencies, when comparing our results among different currencies such as the U.S. dollar, the pound sterling and the euro. Our reporting currency and our functional\ncurrency is the pound sterling and the majority of our operating expenses are paid in pound sterling. We regularly acquire services, consumables and materials in U.S. dollars,\npound sterling and the euro. Further potential future revenue may be derived from non-United Kingdom jurisdictions, particularly from the United States. As a result, our\nbusiness and the value of our ordinary shares, including those represented by the ADSs and underlying the Warrants, may be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates\nbetween the pound sterling and these other currencies, which may have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows from period to period. Currently, we do\nnot have any exchange rate hedging arrangements in place.\nCollaborations, whether through joint ventures, licensing, development arrangements, and other forms of agreements, will be important to our overall business\ndevelopment.\nIn common with many development stage biotechnology companies an element of our business plan is consider entering into collaborative arrangements with larger\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We expect that future collaborations will provide us with important expertise, aid in product development, conducting drug trials,\nfacilitate market entry and may provide some level of funding or future revenue. Notwithstanding our belief that collaborations will be beneficial to us, any collaboration\narrangement may by their nature pose a number of risks, including the following:\n● collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a project;\n● collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n● collaborators may dispute the amounts of payments owed;\n● collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew\ndevelopment or commercialization programs or license arrangements\nIn the past, we have entered into collaborative arrangements with two partners, bluebird bio, Inc. (USA) and Nipro Corporation (Japan), which involved funded or\npartly funded preclinical collaboration. Neither collaboration involve us in any current clinical or development activity or are generating any current cash receipts for us. It is\nuncertain if these collaborations will generate any future cash receipts or obligations for TCB.\nAs a company based outside of the United States, our business is subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations.\nOur business is based in the United Kingdom and is subject to risks associated with conducting business outside of the United States. Many of our suppliers and\nclinical trial relationships are located outside the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom and in the EU. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of\nfactors, including:\n● economic weakness, including inflation, or political change;\n● differing and changing regulatory requirements for product approvals;\n● differing jurisdictions could present different issues for securing, maintaining or obtaining freedom to operate in such jurisdictions;\n● potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n● difficulties in compliance with different, complex and changing laws, regulations and court systems of multiple jurisdictions and compliance with a wide variety of\nforeign laws, treaties and regulations;\n64\n● changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates of the pound sterling, U.S. dollar, euro and currency controls;\n● changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic environment, including the implications of the recent action of the United Kingdom withdrawing from\nthe European Union and efforts related to Scottish independence;\n● customs, tariffs and trade barriers, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by governments;\n● differing medical product reimbursement regimes and price controls;\n● compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad, including, for example, the variable tax treatment in different\njurisdictions of options granted under our share option schemes or equity incentive plans;\n● workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United Kingdom and the United States;\n● difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations, including differing labor relations; and\n● business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nUnstable market and economic factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUncertain or unfavorable global economic or market conditions, such as a recession, an economic slowdown, inflation or reduced growth rates, could significantly\nimpact our operating results or lead to significant reductions in funding sources available to the Company, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or\nfinancial condition. Our operations have required substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to continue the development\nof our GD-T cell-based therapeutic candidates, including for future clinical trials. In the event of unstable markets and unfavorable market conditions, we cannot be certain that\nadditional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We have no committed source of additional capital. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient\namounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our GD-T cell-based therapeutic\ncandidates or other research and development initiatives. Furthermore, uncertain or unfavorable global economic or market conditions may cause our manufacturers, suppliers,\ndistributors, contractors, logistics providers and other external business partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties, which could impact their ability to provide us with\nor distribute finished product, raw and packaging materials or services in a timely manner or at all. We could also face difficulty collecting or recovering accounts receivables\nfrom third parties facing financial or operational difficulties.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine currently does not have any material impact on the company.\nOur operations primarily are undertaken in the United Kingdom and the resources we use primarily are domestically available. We have not specifically sourced any\nresources for our operations from the Ukraine. We may be generally impacted by the macro-economic effects of international sanctions and the effects of inflation, as it would\naffect all businesses.\n65\nComputer system failures, cyber-attacks or deficiencies in our or related parties’ cyber security could result in a material disruption of our product development programs,\ncompromise sensitive information related to our business or trigger contractual and legal obligations, any of which could potentially expose us to liability or reputational\nharm or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have implemented our security measures designed to protect the information (including but not limited to intellectual property, proprietary business information\nand personal information) in our possession, custody or control. Our internal computer systems and those of current and future third parties (such as vendors, CROs,\ncollaborators or others) on which we rely may fail and are vulnerable to breakdown, breach, interruption or damage from computer viruses, computer hackers, malicious code,\nemployee error or malfeasance, theft or misuse, denial-of-service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors, unauthorized access, natural disasters,\nterrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures or other compromise. Despite our security practices, there is a risk that we may be subject to phishing and other\ncyberattacks in the future. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments\nand cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. We may not\nbe able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by\ncyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service\nproviders, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments or agencies. Our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems,\nincluding corporate firewalls, servers, leased lines and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure that could disrupt our operations. If such an event were to\noccur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of\nclinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the\ndata. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates or any future product candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to\ntheir computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to,\nour data or applications, or inappropriate use, disclosure of or access to confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, our competitive position could be\nharmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates or any future product candidates could be hindered or delayed. If we were to experience a\nsignificant cybersecurity breach of our information systems or data, the costs associated with the investigation, remediation and potential notification of the breach to\ncounterparties, data subjects, regulators or others could be material. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. Moreover, if the information technology systems\nof our vendors, CROs, collaborators or other contractors or consultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third\nparties and we may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this\nnature from occurring. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology and cybersecurity infrastructure, we could\nsuffer significant business disruption, including transaction errors, supply chain or manufacturing interruptions, processing inefficiencies, data loss or the loss of or damage to\nintellectual property or other proprietary information. Furthermore, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including\npersonal information regarding clinical trial participants or employees, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and\nforeign law equivalents, cause us to breach our contractual obligations, subject us to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations\nand contracts that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages. As cyber\nthreats continue to evolve, we may be required to incur significant additional expenses in order to enhance our protective measures or to remediate any information security\nvulnerability.\nIn addition, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, varying parts of our workforce are currently working remotely on a part- or full-time basis. This could\nincrease our cyber security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions. Any of the foregoing could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand recognition is critical to our relationships with existing and future third-party therapy locations,\ntherapists, patients and collaborators, and to our ability to attract clinics to become our third-party therapy locations offering our therapies. The promotion of our brand may\nrequire us to make substantial investments, and we anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, these marketing initiatives may become increasingly\ndifficult and expensive. Brand promotion and marketing activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue, and to the extent that these activities yield increased\nrevenue, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, any factor that\ndiminishes our reputation or that of our management, including failing to meet the expectations of our network of third-party therapy locations, therapists and patients, could\nharm our reputation and brand and make it substantially more difficult for us to attract new third-party therapy locations, therapists and patients. If we do not successfully\nmaintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition, our business may not grow and we could lose our relationships with third-party therapy sites, therapists and\npatients, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we\ncould be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, be precluded from manufacturing our products and developing and selling our\ninvestigational therapies or any future therapeutic candidates or be required to develop and implement costly compliance programs, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the UK Bribery Act 2010, or Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or\nFCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business and may do business in the future. The Bribery Act, FCPA and these other laws generally\nprohibit us, our officers, and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to\nobtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage.\nThe Bribery Act, the FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing,\ndirectly or indirectly, a financial or other advantage to government officials or other persons to induce them to improperly perform a relevant function or activity (or reward\nthem for such behavior).\n66\nUnder the Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing to prevent a person associated with us from committing a bribery offense. We, along with those acting on our\nbehalf and our commercial partners, operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and we participate in collaborations\nand relationships with third parties whose corrupt or illegal activities could potentially subject us to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anti-corruption laws, even if\nwe do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which\nour international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nCompliance with the FCPA, in particular, is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA\npresents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees\nare considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government\nofficials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. Need to dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan\nto operate.\nWe may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and we may participate in collaborations and\nrelationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict\nthe nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered\nor interpreted. If we expand our operations, we will need to dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to\noperate.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the UK and the\nU.S., and authorities in the EU, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and currency exchange\nregulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. In addition, various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the\nUnited States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to\nthose products. If we expand our presence outside of the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from\nmanufacturing our products and developing and selling our investigational therapies or any future therapeutic candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our\ngrowth potential and increase our development costs.\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA or\nother legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we\nmay be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade\nControl laws by UK, U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we may become exposed to liability and substantial expenses in connection with\nenvironmental compliance or remediation activities which may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur operations, including our research, development, testing and manufacturing activities, are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and\nregulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the controlled use, manufacture, handling, release and disposal of and the maintenance of a registry for,\nhazardous materials, such as chemical solvents, human cells, carcinogenic compounds, mutagenic compounds and compounds that have a toxic effect on reproduction,\nlaboratory procedures and exposure to blood-borne pathogens.\nWe may incur significant costs to comply with these current or future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with\nsuch laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines or other sanctions.\nAs with other companies engaged in activities similar to ours, we face a risk of environmental liability inherent in our current and historical activities, including\nliability relating to releases of or exposure to hazardous materials and, as a result, may incur material liability as a result of such release or exposure. Environmental, health and\nsafety laws and regulations are becoming more stringent. We may incur substantial expenses in connection with any current or future environmental compliance or remediation\nactivities, in which case, our production and development efforts may be interrupted or delayed and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially\nadversely affected. In the event of an accident involving such hazardous materials, an injured party may seek to hold us liable for damages that result.\n67\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our future collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a\nsignificant disruption of our product development programs and our ability to operate our business effectively.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current and any future collaborators and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer\nviruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any significant system failure,\naccident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a disruption of our development programs and our\nbusiness operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from\ncompleted or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that\nany disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we\ncould incur liability, our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares, including those represented by ADSs, so any returns will be limited to the market value of the ADSs.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any\ncash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, we may enter into agreements that prohibit us from paying cash dividends without prior written consent from our\ncontracting parties, or which include other terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our ordinary shares, including those\nrepresented by the ADSs. Furthermore, under UK corporate law, a company’s accumulated realized profits, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization,\nmust exceed its accumulated realized losses so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made (on a non-consolidated basis), before\ndividends can be paid. In the future, were our dividend policy to change, a dividend or distribution may still be restricted from being declared and paid. For these reasons, any\nreturn to shareholders may therefore be limited to the appreciation of their shares, which may never occur.\nInvestors in our ADSs may not receive distributions on our ordinary shares or any other value applicable to them if it is illegal or impractical to make them available to\nholders of ADSs.\nThe depositary for the ADSs has agreed to pay to the ADS holders the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on our ordinary shares or other\ndeposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses. ADS holders will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of our ordinary shares that the ADSs\nrepresent. In accordance with the limitations set forth in the deposit agreement, however, it may be unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to holders of ADSs.\nWe have no obligation to take any other action to permit distribution on the ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else to holders of the ADSs. This means that ADS holders\nmay not receive the distributions we make on our ordinary shares or any value from them if it is unlawful or impractical to make them available to the ADS holder. These\nrestrictions may have an adverse effect on the value of the ADSs.\nHolders of the ADSs will not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares, and may not receive voting materials or any other documents that would\nneed to be provided to our shareholders pursuant in time to be able to exercise their right to vote.\nHolders of the ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs. The deposit agreement provides that, upon\nreceipt of notice of any meeting of holders of our ordinary shares, the depositary will fix a record date for the determination of ADS holders who shall be entitled to give\ninstructions for the exercise of voting rights. Upon our request, the depositary shall distribute to the holders as of the record date: (i) the notice of the meeting or solicitation of\nconsent or proxy sent by us; and (ii) a statement as to the manner in which instructions may be given by the holders. We cannot guarantee that ADS holders will receive the\nvoting materials in time to ensure that they can instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary shares underlying their ADSs.\nADS holders will not be able to exercise their right to vote directly as a holder of ordinary shares, unless they surrender the ADSs they hold to the depositary and\nwithdraw the ordinary shares underlying such ADSs. Holders of ADSs may not know about the meeting far enough in advance to cancel the ADSs and withdraw those ordinary\nshares. In addition, the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions. As a result,\nholders of ADSs may not be able to exercise their right to vote, and there may be nothing they can do if the ordinary shares underlying their ADSs are not voted as they\nrequested or if their shares cannot be voted.\nHolders of Ordinary Shares and ADSs may not be able to participate in equity offerings we may conduct from time to time.\nAll shareholders and holders of ADSs, including those in the United States have had pre-emption rights waived and therefore the presumption is that shareholders and\nholders of ADSs do not have any right of future participation. Even in the case where preferential subscription rights have not been cancelled or limited, shareholders and ADS\nholders may not be entitled to exercise such rights, unless the offering is registered or the ordinary shares are qualified for sale under the relevant regulatory framework. As a\nresult, there is the risk that investors in ADSs may suffer dilution of their holdings should they not be permitted to participate in preference right equity or other offerings that\nwe may conduct in the future.\n68\nHolders of ADSs may be subject to limitations on the transfer of their ADSs and the withdrawal of the underlying ordinary shares.\nADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in\nconnection with the performance of its duties. The depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the\ndepositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary think it is advisable to do so because of any requirement of law, government or governmental body, or under any\nprovision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason, subject to the right of ADS holders to cancel their ADSs and withdraw the underlying ordinary shares. Temporary\ndelays in the cancellation of the ADSs and withdrawal of the underlying ordinary shares may arise because the depositary has closed its transfer books or we have closed our\ntransfer books, the transfer of ordinary shares is blocked to permit voting at a shareholders meeting or we are paying a dividend on our ordinary shares. In addition, ADS\nholders may not be able to cancel their ADSs and withdraw the underlying ordinary shares when they owe money for fees, taxes and similar charges and when it is necessary to\nprohibit withdrawals in order to comply with any laws or governmental regulations that apply to ADSs or to the withdrawal of ordinary shares or other deposited securities.\nHolders of ADSs may not be entitled to a jury trial with respect to claims arising under the deposit agreement, which could result in less favorable outcomes to the\nplaintiff(s) in any such action.\nThe deposit agreement governing the ADSs representing our ordinary shares provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, owners and holders of ADSs\nirrevocably waive the right to a jury trial of any claim they may have against us or the depositary arising out of or relating to the ADSs or the deposit agreement.\nIf this jury trial waiver provision is not permitted by applicable law, an action could proceed under the terms of the deposit agreement with a jury trial. If we or the\ndepositary oppose a jury trial demand based on the waiver, the court would determine whether the waiver was enforceable based on the facts and circumstances of that case in\naccordance with the applicable state and federal law. To our knowledge, the enforceability of a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver in connection with claims arising under\nthe federal securities laws has not been finally adjudicated by the United States Supreme Court. However, we believe that a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision is\ngenerally enforceable, including under the law of the State of New York, which governs the deposit agreement, by a federal or state court in the City and County of New York,\nwhich has non-exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under the deposit agreement. In determining whether to enforce a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision,\ncourts will generally consider whether a party knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to a jury trial. We believe that this is the case with respect to the deposit\nagreement and the ADSs. It is advisable that investors consult legal counsel regarding the jury waiver provision before entering into the deposit agreement.\nIf holders or beneficial owners of ADSs bring a claim against us or the depositary in connection with matters arising under the deposit agreement or the ADSs,\nincluding claims under federal securities laws, such holder or beneficial owner may not be entitled to a jury trial with respect to such claims, which may have the effect of\nlimiting and discouraging lawsuits against us and/or the depositary. If a lawsuit is brought against us and/or the depositary under the deposit agreement, it may be heard only by\na judge or justice of the applicable trial court, which would be conducted according to different civil procedures and may result in different outcomes than a trial by jury would\nhave had, including results that could be less favorable to the plaintiff(s) in any such action, depending on, among other things, the nature of the claims, the judge or justice\nhearing such claims, and the venue of the hearing.\nNo condition, stipulation or provision of the deposit agreement or ADSs serves as a waiver by any holder or beneficial owner of ADSs or by us or the depositary of\ncompliance with U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nHolders of ADSs have limited choice of forum, which could limit their ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for complaints against us, the depositary or our\nrespective directors, officers or employees.\nThe deposit agreement governing the ADSs provides that: (i) the deposit agreement and the ADSs will be interpreted in accordance with the law of the State of New\nYork; and (ii) as an owner of ADSs, the investor irrevocably agrees that any legal action arising out of the deposit agreement and the ADSs involving us or the depositary may\nonly be instituted in a state or federal court sitting in the City and County of New York. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any the ADSs, whether by\ntransfer, sale, operation of law or otherwise, shall be deemed to have notice of and have irrevocably agreed and consented to these provisions. This choice of forum provision\nmay increase costs and limit the ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the ADS holder finds favorable for disputes with us, the depositary or our and the depositary’s\nrespective directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us, the depositary and our and the depositary’s respective directors, officers or\nemployees. However, it is possible that a court could find such choice of forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. The enforceability of similar choice of forum\nprovisions has been challenged in legal proceedings. It is possible that a court could find this type of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable.\nTo the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to\nenforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction\nfor federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, actions by our\nADS holders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or the respective rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in a federal\ncourt. Our ADS holders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\n69\nIf we are a “passive foreign investment company,” or a PFIC, in any particular year, a U.S. shareholder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, we will be a PFIC for any taxable year in which, after the application of certain look-through rules\nwith respect to our subsidiaries, either (i) 75% or more of our gross income consists of passive income or (ii) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of our assets consists\nof assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income (including cash). Passive income includes, among other things, dividends, interest, certain non-active\nrents and royalties, and capital gains. Based on our operations, income, assets and certain estimates and projections, including as to the relative values of our assets and the\ntreatment of amounts in respect of refundable tax credits from governmental entities we received, or are or may become entitled to receive, as gross income that is not passive\nincome, we do not believe that we were a PFIC in 2020 and do not expect to be a PFIC for our 2021 taxable year. However, the determination whether we are a PFIC is a fact-\nintensive determination that must be made on an annual basis applying principles and methodologies that are in some circumstances unclear, and whether we will be a PFIC in\n2022 or any future taxable year is uncertain because, among other things, (i) we currently own a substantial amount of passive assets, including cash, (ii) the valuation of our\nassets that generate non-passive income for PFIC purposes, including our intangible assets, is uncertain and may depend in part of the market price of the ADSs or, if applicable,\nour ordinary shares from time to time, which may fluctuate substantially, (iii) the treatment of amounts in respect of refundable tax credits from governmental entities we\nreceived, or are or may become entitled to receive, as gross income that is not passive income is uncertain, and (iv) the composition of our income may vary substantially over\ntime. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for any taxable year, and our U.S. counsel expresses no opinion with respect to our PFIC status, or with\nrespect to our expectations regarding our PFIC status in 2023 or any future taxable year.\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. investor holds ADSs or ordinary shares, we would continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to that U.S.\ninvestor for all succeeding years during which the U.S. investor holds the ADSs or ordinary shares, even if we ceased to meet the threshold requirements for PFIC status, unless\ncertain exceptions apply. Such a U.S. investor may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including (i) the treatment of all or a portion of any gain on the\ndisposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares as ordinary income (and therefore ineligible for the preferential rates that apply to capital gains with respect to some U.S. investors),\n(ii) the application of a deferred interest charge on such gain and the receipt of certain dividends on the ADSs or the ordinary shares and (iii) compliance with certain reporting\nrequirements. We do not intend to provide the information that would enable investors to make a qualified electing fund election, or a QEF Election, with respect to their\nholding of ADSs or ordinary shares that could mitigate the adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. investor should we be classified as a PFIC.\nIf we are a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there could be adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to certain U.S. holders who\nown, directly, indirectly or by attribution, ten percent or more of our ordinary shares.\nEach “Ten Percent Shareholder” (as defined below) in a non-U.S. corporation that is classified as a “controlled foreign corporation,” or a CFC, for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes generally is required to include in income for U.S. federal tax purposes such Ten Percent Shareholder’s pro rata share of the CFC’s “Subpart F income”, investment\nof earnings in U.S. property, and “global intangible low-taxed income”, even if the CFC has made no distributions to its shareholders. In addition, a Ten Percent Shareholder\nthat realizes gain from the sale or exchange of shares in a CFC may be required to classify a portion of such gain as dividend income rather than capital gain. A non-U.S.\ncorporation generally will be classified as a CFC for U.S. federal income tax purposes if Ten Percent Shareholders own, directly, indirectly or constructively (through\nattribution), more than 50% of either the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote or of the total value of the stock of such\ncorporation.\nA “Ten Percent Shareholder” is a United States person (as defined by the Code) who owns or is considered to own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of\nall classes of stock entitled to vote of such corporation or 10% or more of the total value of the stock of such corporation. The determination of CFC status is complex and\nincludes attribution rules, the application of which is not entirely certain. A failure by a United States shareholder of a CFC to comply with its reporting obligations may subject\nthe United States shareholder to significant monetary penalties and other adverse tax consequences, and may extend the statute of limitations. We cannot provide any assurances\nthat we will assist U.S. holders in determining whether we or any of our non- U.S. subsidiaries are CFCs or whether any holder is a Ten Percent Shareholder. We also cannot\nguarantee that we will furnish information that may be necessary to comply with the aforementioned obligations. U.S. holders should consult their own advisors regarding the\npotential application of these rules.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nTC BioPharm recognizes the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data.\nManaging Material Risks & Integrated Overall Risk Management\nCurrently, TC BioPharm does not have a formalized cybersecurity risk management process. However, the organization is working toward implementing a framework for\nassessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. The IT department will work to continuously evaluate and address cybersecurity risks in\nalignment with our business objectives and operational needs. This includes assessing cybersecurity risk as part of an overall risk assessment and considering the likelihood and\npotential consequences of each risk. Plans also include the identification of critical cybersecurity risks (e.g., malware, phishing, ransomware, and unauthorized access) and the\nimplementation of formalized mitigants to address those risks such as cybersecurity policies and incident response strategy.\nThird-Party Risk\nTC BioPharm does not currently engage with third parties in connection with cybersecurity risk management. Third-party consultants including cybersecurity auditors are being\nconsidered for future engagement, at which point any risks stemming from the use of third parties will be incorporated in the cybersecurity risk assessment.\nRisks from Cybersecurity Threats\nTC BioPharm has not encountered any cybersecurity risks or incidents that have materially impacted our business strategy, operational results, or financial condition. We\nremain dedicated to maintaining a strong cybersecurity posture by continually analyzing and improving our security procedures to reduce potential risks. This approach to\ncybersecurity is critical for protecting sensitive information and guaranteeing the reliability of our business operations.\nGovernance\nBoard of Directors Oversight\nThe Board of Directors is acutely aware of the critical nature of managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats. The Board is committed to effective governance in\nmanaging risks associated with cybersecurity threats because we recognize the significance of these threats to our operational integrity and stakeholder confidence.\nThe Board of Directors is informed of relevant cybersecurity risks and related updates during quarterly Board meetings by the CFO who is also a Board member. There have\nbeen no critical, time sensitive cybersecurity updates thus far, but if this did occur it would be escalated to the Board immediately.\n70\nManagement’s Role Managing Risk\nWithin the management team, the responsibility for assessing and managing cybersecurity risk falls under the purview of the Senior IT Manager, whose background includes a\nQualification in Network System Engineering coupled with over two decades of experience in fortifying cybersecurity for various companies. Moreover, TC BioPharm partners\nwith a Managed IT service provider. This enriches our collective capabilities by leveraging their extensive experience and specialized skills. This collaboration significantly\nbolsters our overall cybersecurity stance, creating a well-rounded and robust defense against emerging threats.\nMonitoring Cybersecurity Incidents\nTC BioPharm’s Senior IT Manager monitors cybersecurity events and logs for unusual activity or potential security breaches within the network. E-mail alerts are sent in real\ntime as notification for any suspicious activity including phishing attempts, suspicious attachments, and other e-mail-related security concerns. The Senior IT Manager also\nactively utilizes the WatchGuard & Webroot Advance Security tools to conduct regular and thorough scans of the network infrastructure. The tools help identify vulnerabilities,\nmalware, and other potential threats, enabling a proactive measure to prevent and mitigate cybersecurity incidents.\nReporting to Board of Directors\nThe CFO holds biweekly meetings with the Senior IT Manager to discuss any pertinent information regarding cybersecurity risks. This includes briefings on existing threat\nscenarios, updates on incident response efforts, and recommendations for enhancing our cybersecurity stance. As a member of the Board of Directors, the CFO communicates\nkey information to the remaining Board members.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur corporate headquarters and most of our operations, including our research and manufacturing facilities, are located at Maxim 1, 2 Parklands Way, Holytown,\nMotherwell, ML1 4WR, United Kingdom. The lease for this space expires February 28, 2029 and covers a total leasable area of approximately 26,300 square feet. We believe\nthat our office facilities and the production and research facilities in the United Kingdom are sufficient to meet our current needs.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various disputes, claims, suits, investigations, and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that\nthe resolution of current pending legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Nonetheless, we\ncannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, as legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn accordance with the terms of a Convertible Loan Note (‘Note’) on August 9, 2022 (the Conversion Date) the Company issued 183,820 Ordinary Shares and 367,640\nlisted warrants to the Note holder in full satisfaction of the Note in the aggregate amount of $781,233. The holder filed a claim in the English courts on June 19, 2023 asserting\nthat notice was provided such that the Company should have paid it the value of the Note in cash, rather than by settling it through the issuance of Ordinary Shares and listed\nwarrants. The holder is demanding payment of the face value of the Note, together with interest, (approximately $860,000). The litigation process is in its early stages and is not\nexpected to conclude until late 2024 or later. The Company has retained English solicitors and is contesting the claim in its entirety. The Company believes that it acted\ncorrectly under the terms of the Note and has accounted for the transaction on that basis, and that no further amounts are payable to the holder.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNone.\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur share capital currently consists of ordinary shares. We may issue new classes of shares with such rights or restrictions as may be determined by special (75%)\nresolution of the shareholders, including shares which are to be redeemed, or are liable to be redeemed at our option or the option of the holder of such shares. The ADSs and\npublic Warrants have been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “TCBP” and “TCBPW,” respectively, since February 11, 2022.\nDividends\nWe have never declared or paid a dividend, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain all available funds and\nany future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business. Under Scottish law, among other things, we may only pay dividends if we have sufficient\ndistributable reserves (on a non-consolidated basis), which are our accumulated realized profits that have not been previously distributed or capitalized less our accumulated\nrealized losses, so far as such losses have not been previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, all sales of unregistered securities by the Company have been previously reported on a Form 6-K as the Company qualified\nas a foreign private issuer during this period.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nWe did not repurchase any of our equity securities during the period covered by this Annual Report.\nItem 6. [Reserved]\n71\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements (prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-\nK”). The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a\ndiscussion of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with those statements. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-\nlooking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in the section entitled “Risk Factors.” Unless\nwe state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to TC BioPharm (Holdings) Limited and its subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a cell-based product pipeline capable of treating a variety of disorders including cancer and infectious disease.\nWe are currently developing a pipeline of unmodified allogeneic GD-T therapies and next generation GD CAR-T treatments with a number of advantages over conventional\napproaches. We own our main patent families in the GD CAR-T space, providing robust IP protection and manufactures all products in-house, leading to a much lower cost of\ngoods than competitor products.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe do not have any approved products. Accordingly, we have not generated any revenue from the sale of products, and we do not expect to generate any such revenue\nunless and until we obtain regulatory approvals for, and commercialize any of, our product candidates. In the future, we will seek to generate revenue primarily from product\nsales and, potentially, regional or global collaborations with strategic partners, which may produce license fee income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we had two collaboration agreements. Revenue arose under these contracts as a result of (i) our recharging development\ncosts incurred by us under those agreements to our partners and (ii) on upfront payments received under those collaboration agreements, which were taken to revenue on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated term over which the services promised will be provided. This term was estimated by management at the inception of each contract and re-\nevaluated at each reporting date. The Company ceased to have an effective obligation to continue to provide unpaid services from December 7, 2022. Thus, noting that a) the\nCompany did not have any additional obligations to the collaboration partner and 2) the upfront payment (that was recognized as deferred revenue) was non-refundable we\nrecognized any remaining deferred revenue upon termination of the contract in December of 2022.\nSince inception through December 31, 2023, the Company has received £14.5 million in pre-clinical payments connected with CAR-T development partnerships.\nThese partnerships are no longer actively being progressed and it is unlikely that we will receive any future milestone revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into two categories: research and development expenses and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, including salaries, benefits,\nbonuses and share-based payment expense, comprise a significant component of each of these expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with personnel costs based\non the function performed by the respective employees.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe largest component of our total operating expenses since inception has been costs related to our research and development activities, including the preclinical and\nclinical development of our product candidates.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred, with our development activities not yet at the point at which capitalization can occur under GAAP. Our\nresearch and development expense primarily consist of:\n● consumable costs related to research and development of pharmaceutical or biologic therapy products for preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● costs related to manufacturing active pharmaceutical or biologic therapy products for preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● salaries and personnel-related costs, including bonuses, benefits and any share-based payment expense, for our personnel performing research and development activities\nor managing those activities that have been out-sourced;\n● fees paid to consultants and other third parties who support our product candidate development;\n72\n● third party costs incurred in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials from investigative sites and contract research organizations, or CROs;\n● other costs incurred in seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates;\n● costs of related office space allocated to our research and development function, materials and equipment; and\n● payments under our license agreements.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher\ndevelopment costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. In addition, the cost of\ndevelopment of our CAR-T range of products is likely to be substantially higher than costs incurred historically in the development of our unmodified products. Accordingly,\nwe expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to\naccurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our\nproduct candidates to offset these expenses. Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in\ntiming and cost to completion.\nThe duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors including:\n● the scope, rate of progress, results and expenses of our ongoing and future clinical trials, preclinical studies and research and development activities;\n● the potential need for additional clinical trials or preclinical studies requested by regulatory agencies;\n● potential uncertainties in clinical trial enrolment rates or drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;\n● competition with other drug development companies in, and the related expense of, identifying and enrolling patients in our clinical trials and contracting with third-party\nmanufacturers for the production of the drug product needed for our clinical trials;\n● the achievement of milestones requiring payments under in-licensing agreements;\n● any significant changes in government regulation;\n● the terms and timing of any regulatory approvals;\n● the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and\n● the ease, cost and ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates, if approved.\nWe track research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis for both clinical-stage and preclinical product candidates. Manufacturing, clinical trial\nand preclinical research and development expenses are assigned or allocated to individual product candidates. We do not allocate employee costs or facility expenses, including\ndepreciation or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal\nresources primarily to oversee research and development as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development\nactivities.\nAdministrative Expenses\nAdministrative expenses consist of personnel costs, other administrative expenses and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit and\naccounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense. Other administrative expenses include office space-related\ncosts not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees and costs of our information systems. We anticipate that our administrative expenses will\ncontinue to increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe expect to continue to incur additional expenses as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq,\nadditional insurance expenses, and expenses related to investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.\nAdministrative Expenses – Costs to prepare for listing\nAdministrative costs to prepare for our IPO consist of professional services such as legal, investor relations, accounting, audit, and other administrative services.\n73\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nThe gain/loss relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative related to the issue of Convertible Loan Notes, calculated by using a Black\nScholes option pricing model at the end of each reporting period. The gain/loss relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of our warrants, calculated by using a Black\nScholes option pricing model at the end of each reporting period. As it pertains to the issued warrants, it is important to note that as of December 31, 2023 they were primarily\nequity classified and therefore are no longer required to be re-measured to fair value at the end of each reporting period.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes the effective interest charge accrued in relation to the Convertible Loan Notes. Interest expense is offset by interest income related to interest\nearned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits.\nIncome Tax Credit\nWe are subject to corporate taxation in the United Kingdom. Due to the nature of our business, we have generated losses since inception. Our income tax credit\nrecognized represents the sum of the research and development tax credits recoverable in the United Kingdom.\nAs a company that carries out extensive research and development activities, we benefit from the United Kingdom research and development tax credit regime and are\nable to surrender some of our losses for a cash rebate of up to 33.35% of expenditures related to eligible research and development projects. Qualifying expenditures largely\ncomprise clinical trial and manufacturing costs, employment costs for relevant staff and consumables incurred as part of research and development projects. Certain\nsubcontracted qualifying research and development expenditures are eligible for a cash rebate of up to 21.68%. A large portion of costs relating to our research and\ndevelopment, clinical trials and manufacturing activities are eligible for inclusion within these tax credit cash rebate claims.\nThere can be no certainty that we will be able to continue to claim research and development tax credits in the future. Tax losses that have not been utilized to offset\ntaxable income or surrendered in connection with the aforementioned research and development tax credits are carried forward to be offset against future taxable profits. In the\nevent we generate revenues in the future, we may benefit from the United Kingdom’s government’s “patent box” initiative that allows profits attributable to revenues from\npatents and/or patented products registered in the United Kingdom or European Union to be taxed at a lower rate than other streams of revenue. The current rate of tax for\nrelevant streams of revenue for companies receiving this relief is 10%.\n74\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations:\nFor the Year For the Year\nEnded Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 £ Change % Change\nRevenue £ - £ 3,844,532 £ (3,844,532) (100)%\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development expenses 7,771,391 7,592,470 178,921 2%\nAdministrative expenses 6,467,932 7,030,972 (563,040) (8)%\nAdministrative expenses - costs to prepare for listing - 1,305,087 (1,305,087) (100)%\nTotal operating expenses 14,239,323 15,928,529 (1,689,206) (11)%\nLoss from operations (14,239,323) (12,083,997) (2,155,326) 18%\nOther income (expense):\nLoss on modification of convertible loan (645,845) (140,344) (505,501) 360%\nChange in fair value of derivative liability 8,052,581 16,064,945 (8,012,364) (50)%\nForeign currency losses (80,070) (120,974) 40,904 (34)%\nInterest expense (83,025) (6,753,231) 6,670,206 (99)%\nTotal other income (expense), net 7,243,641 9,050,396 (1,806,755) (20)%\nNet loss before income taxes (6,995,682) (3,033,601) (3,962,081) 131%\nIncome tax credit 1,088,729 1,720,000 (631,271) (37)%\nNet loss £ (5,906,953) £ (1,313,601) £ (4,593,352) 350%\nRevenue\nRevenue decreased by £3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue from upfront payments in\nconnection with collaboration agreements is recognized over the estimated term over which the services promised will be provided. This term was estimated by management at\nthe inception of each contract and evaluated at each reporting date. Management reviewed the status of the contract and specific contractual terms and concluded that at\nDecember 31, 2022, no further services were required to be provided under the contract. As such, the remaining deferred revenue, which reflected a non-refundable upfront\npayment received from our collaboration partner was fully recognized during December 2022. Thus, no revenue stemming from the upfront payment was recognized during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n£’000’s £’000’s £ Change % Change\nDirect research and development expenses by program:\nUnmodified cell therapy programs(1) £ 3,212 £ 1,257 £ 1,955 155.5%\nOther research and development programs(2) 64 136 (72) (52.7)%\nTotal direct research and development expense 3,276 1,393 1,883 135.2%\nResearch and development and unallocated costs:\nPersonnel related (including share-based compensation) 3,365 4,504 (1,139) (25.3)%\nIndirect research and development expense(3) 1,130 1,695 (565) (33.4)%\nTotal research and development expenses £ 7,771 £ 7,592 £ 179 2.4%\n(1) Unmodified cell therapy programs include OmnImmune® and ImmuniStim®\n(2) Other research and development programs include expenditure on areas such as our CAR-T program and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).\n(3) Indirect research and development expense includes property related costs and depreciation and amortization.\nResearch and development expenses increased by 2.4% to £7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from £7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022\nreflecting the increased work on unmodified cell therapy programs, which increased by 156%. Personnel costs partially offset the increase, which decreased by 25% for the year\nended December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022.\n75\nGeneral and administrative\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 £ Change % Change\n£’000’s £’000’s\nShare-based compensation expense 295 719 £ (424) (59.0)%\nEmployee-related costs 2,443 2,396 47 2.0%\nLegal & professional fees 3,383 3,569 (186) (5.2)%\nOther expenses 347 347 - 0.0%\n6,468 7,031\nTotal administrative expenses (563) (8.0)%\nAdministrative expenses decreased by 8% to £6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from £7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\ndecrease was primarily driven by a decrease in share-based compensation expense and a decrease in legal and professional fees.\nLoss on modification of convertible loan\nThe change in the loss on modification of convertible loan primarily relates to modifications made to the loan in 2023 as compared to 2022. The convertible loan was\nfully settled (via either cash settlement or conversion) during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nThe change in fair value of derivative liability is comprised of the change in fair values of the convertible loan derivative, warrant derivative, and other derivatives. The\nchange in the fair value of the embedded convertible loan derivatives relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (ie. as compared to December 31, 2022), which was calculated by using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The convertible loan was fully settled (via\neither cash settlement or conversion) during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe change in fair value of the warrant derivatives of £8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 relates to the movement in the estimated fair value of our\nissued detachable warrants. The warrants were issued at the time of the IPO and at various times during each of the two years ended December 31, 2023. In addition, certain\nwarrants were both modified and induced over the course of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. All of our issued warrants are valued by using the Black Scholes option\npricing model.\nForeign Currency Losses\nThe decrease in foreign currency losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to a lower foreign\nexchange rate during 2023.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was approximately £0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to £6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease\nwas due to the Convertible Loan Note being paid off during the year. Interest expense was partially offset by interest income earned on cash accounts.\nIncome tax credit\nThe research and development tax credit of £1.1 million was 37% lower for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to £1.7 million for the year ended December\n31, 2022. This was due to lower levels of expenditure eligible for research and development tax credits.\nAfter accounting for tax credits receivable, there were accumulated tax losses for carry forward in the United Kingdom of £16.4 million as of December 31, 2023.\nUnrecognized deferred tax assets totaling £4.2 million as of December 31, 2023 consist of temporary differences on tax losses and share-based compensation arrangements. No\ndeferred tax asset is recognized in respect of accumulated tax losses or temporary differences on share-based compensation arrangements because future profits are not\nsufficiently certain.\nGoing Concern\nOur existing cash of £2.5 million at December 31, 2023 will not be sufficient to enable us to conduct our business 12 months from the issuance of these financial\nstatements. We will need additional funding to complete the development and research of our products. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we\nwould be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development efforts.\n76\nAs a result of the Company’s recurring losses from operations, and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements, there is uncertainty\nregarding the Company’s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred net losses of £5.9 million and £1.3 million, respectively. We used £10.5 million of cash in operating\nactivities in the year ended December 31, 2023 and used £15.3 million of cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of £2.5 million and £4.8 million, respectively. From incorporation through\nDecember 31, 2023, we have financed our operations primarily through our IPO, private placements of equity securities, convertible loans, government grants, research and\ndevelopment tax credits, and receipts from partner for collaborative research and development services totaling £82.1 million.\nWhile we work towards obtaining regulatory approval to advance any of our GD-T cell therapeutic candidates into pivotal clinical trials or to commercialization, we\nwill incur significant research and development expenses, and also commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution and\nadditional funding would be required. Where appropriate, we will seek to fund our operations through milestone payments under our agreements with collaboration partners and\nadditional equity financings.\nCash Flows\nThe following tables summarize the results of our cash flows for the below respective periods:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities £ (10,544,870) £ (15,292,297)\nInvesting activities £ (208,789) £ (310,197)\nFinancing activities £ 8,520,376 £ 18,653,214\nChange in cash £ (2,345,451) £ (3,241,372)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was £10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £5.9 million,\nwhich was offset by noncash items of £6.2 million, consisting of £0.6 million in depreciation and amortization, £0.4 million in share-based compensation expense, a £0.6\nmillion loss on modification of the Convertible Loan Note, an £8.1 million change in the fair value of the derivative liability, a £0.1 million net foreign exchange loss, and £0.1\nmillion in noncash interest expense. Changes in working capital amounted to £1.5 million, which consisted of an increase in the corporation tax receivable, operating lease right\nof use assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses. Prepaid expenses and other current assets and lease liabilities decreased working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was £15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £1.3 million,\nwhich was offset by noncash items of £7.3 million, consisting of £0.8 million in depreciation and amortization, £1.1 million in share-based compensation expense, a £0.1\nmillion loss on modification of the Convertible Loan Note, a £16.1 million change in the fair value of the derivative liability, a £0.1 million net foreign exchange loss, and £6.6\nmillion in noncash interest expense. Changes in working capital used £6.7 million in cash.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was £0.2 million and £0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts relate primarily\nto purchases of property, plant and equipment related to our facility and patent filing costs.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash from financing activities was £8.5 million and £18.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, these amounts consisted of net proceeds from sale of own shares and warrants for £9.3 million offset by issuance costs of £0.8 million. For the year ended December 31,\n2022, these amounts consisted of net proceeds from sale of own shares and warrants for £22.2 million offset by the repayment of convertible loan notes of £2.6 million.\n77\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our\nproduct candidates. Our expenses will increase as we (i) advance our product candidates through phases of clinical development and, potentially, registration, (ii) fund our\nresearch and development activities to further expand our GD-T cell technologies and develop future product candidates and follow-on versions of our more advanced product\ncandidates, (iii) fund our manufacturing activities and the expansion of our plant to support our ongoing and future clinical trials and potential commercial launch; and (iv) fund\nour general operations.\nSince February 10, 2022, we have been a publicly traded company and incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur as a\nprivate company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, requires public companies to implement\nspecified corporate governance practices. We expect to continue to incur substantial legal and financial compliance costs, which may make some activities more time-\nconsuming and costly.\nWe will require additional capital to continue to conduct our business and implement our business plans.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical product candidates, we are unable to\nestimate the amount of our future working capital requirements, which will depend on and are likely to increase significantly as a result of many uncertain factors, including:\n● the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n● the costs, timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n● the costs of future sales and marketing activities, including cost of product sales, medical regulatory affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our\nproduct candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n● the amount and timing of the receipt of any future revenue from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and\nbecome successful in the market;\n● the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to progress research and development and clinical trials;\n● the costs and timing of hiring new employees to support our future growth;\n● the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related\nclaims; and\n● the cost of and extent to which we in-license or acquire additional product candidates or technologies.\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our future cash needs through equity offerings\nand debt and a combination thereof, including securities convertible into ordinary shares and through development collaborations with partners. To the extent that we raise\nadditional capital through the sale of equity, our shareholders’ ownership interest will be diluted.\nIf we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaborations agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution\narrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that\nmay not be favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization\nefforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. If we raise funding through\nborrowings, we may have to enter into onerous covenants which may adversely impact our operations and our ability to obtain further funding.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to raise any further funding, or if further funding is offered, it will be on terms that are acceptable to us and may bring\ndilution which is unacceptable to our shareholders.\n78\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows\nin future periods:\nPayments due by period\nLess Than 1 More Than 5\nTotal Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years Years\n£ 1,847,279 £ 1,847,279 £ – £ – £ –\nTrade payables\nLease liabilities 2,235,075 447,015 894,030 894,030 –\nPayables related to clinical trial testing 1,177,500 1,177,500 – – –\nOther payables 1,407,061 1,407,061 – – –\nTotal commitments £ 6,666,915 £ 4,878,855 £ 894,030 £ 894,030 £ -\nLease liabilities\nAmounts shown as lease liabilities and similar reflect minimum payments due for our leases of office, laboratory and manufacturing space. We entered into a lease for\nour corporate headquarters in April 2014 and, as part of this agreement, exercised an option to lease additional space in January 2017 and March 2019. The overall lease expires\nin February 2029.\nOther commitments\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third parties who support us in the conduct of certain specialist aspects of clinical trials and preclinical\nresearch studies and testing. These contracts are generally cancellable by us upon prior notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or\nexpenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the preceding table, as the\namount and timing of such payments are not known.\nWe have not included any contingent payment obligations that we may incur upon achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, as applicable, or\nroyalty payments that we may be required to make under in-licensing agreements which we have or may enter into which could be payable if any of our products generate\nfuture sales or license revenue as the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known and are not anticipated in the near term or before we generate significant\nrevenues.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to\nmake estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we\ncontinually evaluate our estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results may materially differ from\nthese estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions.\nCertain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position, are described\nbelow. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoing Concern\nOur evaluation of our ability to continue as a going concern requires us to evaluate our future sources and uses of cash sufficient to fund our currently expected\noperations in conducting research and development activities one year from the date our consolidated financial statements are issued. We evaluate the probability associated\nwith each source and use of cash resources in making our going concern determination. The research and development of cell therapies is inherently subject to uncertainty.\nManagement believes that its existing cash balances will only be able to fund current operations to May 2024. Should the additional planned financings not occur as\nexpected, management will implement alternative arrangements and such arrangements could have a potentially significant negative impact on the current net asset value of the\nCompany. These alternatives include: (1) raising additional capital by means other than those planned through equity and/or debt financings; (2) entering into new commercial\nrelationships to help fund future clinical trial costs (i.e. licensing and partnerships); (3) reducing and/or deferring discretionary spending on general corporate overheads and one\nor more of our research and development and / or clinical programs; and/or (4) restructuring operations to change our overhead structure and make use of our manufacturing\nfacilities to generate revenues from through third party manufacturing contracts. In the medium term, the Company’s future liquidity needs, and ability to address those needs,\nwill largely be determined by the success of its product candidates and key development and regulatory events and its decisions in the future.\n79\nAs a result of the Company’s recurring losses from operations, and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements, there is uncertainty\nregarding the Company’s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nIdentification of contracts with pharma partners\nThe Company entered into collaboration agreements with a number of parties. Application of Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers, on collaboration agreements requires judgement around whether these contracts fall within the scope of ASC 606. The Company’s core business is around\nresearching and developing immunotherapies and the contracts entered into with pharma partners were consistent with those objectives and the outputs are in line with the\nCompany’s ordinary activities. The contracts with pharma partners did not involve sharing the risks and benefits of a joint arrangement in the sense of Topic 808 “Collaborative\narrangements”. In light of work undertaken with pharma partners, and the fact that these agreements had commercial substance with clearly defined milestones and rights and\nobligations for each party, management concluded that these collaboration agreements met the definition of a contract with a customer and fall within the scope of ASC 606.\nIdentification of performance obligations in contracts\nThe collaboration agreements entered into by the Company included obligations to fulfil the research and development programs. The Company identified, from\nreviews of the relevant agreements, that there are no specific obligations but an implied performance obligation to deliver each overall contracted research and development\nprogram. Due to the broad nature of these obligations, spanning the full duration of the contract, the obligations were satisfied over the expected duration of the relevant\ncontract.\nDetermination and allocation of the transaction price\nThe collaboration agreements included a number of elements of consideration and were allocated to the satisfaction of the relevant obligation. The Company can\nreceive upfront payments as part of the consideration. The Company has determined that upfront payments are in connection with the performance of the research and\ndevelopment program and are satisfied during the duration of the contract.\nThe business is entitled to receive contractual milestone payments on achievement of certain performance obligations, with revenue being recognized in the same way.\nThe relevant transaction price is allocated to the related milestone.\nKey Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\nThe key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material\nadjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year are discussed below.\nConvertible loan\nThe Company established a $20.0 million convertible loan note instrument in April 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company converted loan\nnotes totaling $809,692 (£619,315) into ordinary shares and warrants over ordinary shares such that no loan notes were outstanding as at December 31, 2023. During the year to\nDecember 31, 2022, the Group converted loan notes totaling $14,228,245 (£10,506,174) into ordinary shares and warrants over ordinary shares and repaid loan notes totaling\n$3,195,765 (£2,632,324). The Company analyzed the conversion feature of the convertible loan note under ASC 815-Derivatives and Hedging. Where there are outstanding\namounts under the convertible loan note, these are recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet at the reporting date. The conversion feature for any such outstanding\namounts requires liability treatment on the consolidated balance sheet and was recorded at fair value with changes to the fair value being recorded through the consolidated\nstatement of operations.\nExcept for the loan notes described below, all other loan notes were repaid or converted into ordinary shares and warrants over ordinary shares 180 days after the\nlisting date.\nOn August 9, 2022, the Company agreed with one of the loan note holders not to exercise the right to require the loan notes to be repaid in cash in accordance with the\nterms of the loan notes and to amend certain other aspects of the loan notes (“amended loan notes”). As additional consideration, the Company has issued warrants to subscribe\nfor 233,560 ordinary shares in the share capital of the Company. Except for the amended loan notes, all other loan notes were repaid or converted into ordinary shares and\nwarrants over ordinary shares 180 days after the listing date.\nThe changes note above represent a substantial amendment as the modifications are related to:\n(i) Removing the exercise of the right to require the loan in cash as of August 9, 2022.\n(ii)Extending the repayment date to January 31, 2023 and modifying the structure to be repaid in shares if not redeemed before in cash.\n(iii)Revising the conversion price for the conversion of the loan notes in shares. The revised conversion price would be $0.50 and, if the 5-day trailing VWAP of the\nCompany’s ADS is above that and $0.20 as a floor.\n(iv)Giving the option to the holder for redemption in cash, which will occur no later than February 10, 2023 and to the Company for an early redemption at any moment but\nhaving the Holder an option to convert into shares using the revised conversion price at that moment.\n80\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company agreed with the loan note holder not to exercise the right to require the loan notes to be repaid in cash in accordance with the terms of\nthe loan notes and to amend certain other aspects of the loan notes (“2023 amended loan notes”). As additional consideration, the Company issued warrants to subscribe\nfor 4,000,000 ordinary shares of the Company. These warrants contained a condition whereby if a registration statement, to be filed by the Company, registering all of the\nsecurities underlying the note holder’s amended convertible loan note, was not declared effective by July 31, 2023, the note holder will be entitled to receive 0.30 Ordinary\nShares for each share it was originally entitled to purchase under these warrants without the payment of any additional consideration. No such registration statement was filed.\nThe related fair value of the issue of any additional securities is approximately $37,000 and is not considered material to the financial statements.\nThe modifications to the 2023 amended loan notes represent as substantial amendment as the modifications are related to:\n(i) A waiver to any defaults arising in connection with the 2022 amended loan notes.\n(ii) Extending the repayment date to January 15, 2024; and\n(iii) Amend the Conversion Price (as defined in the Loan Note) of the outstanding loan notes to be the lesser of $1.00 or the lowest closing price of the Ordinary\nShares during the ten (10) day period prior to the date the Noteholder delivers a notice of conversion to the Company, not to be lower than $0.20.\nIn accordance with ASC 470, an exchange between an existing borrower and lender of debt instruments with substantially different terms shall be accounted for as an\nextinguishment of the original financial liability (with the associated gain or loss presented in the statement of operations) and the recognition of a new financial liability. In\naddition, as consideration for these modifications, the Company has issued additional warrants to subscribe for 4,000,000 ordinary shares of the Company.\nThe original financial instrument was derecognized, including any unamortized transaction costs, and the new instrument was initially recognized at fair value and\nsubsequently measured at amortized cost at each reporting date.\nThe conversion option is a single embedded derivative that is separately recognized as a liability and accounted for at fair value through the statement of operations. The\nconversion options are financial liabilities in accordance with ASC 815 because the Company issues shares such that the fair value of the shares delivered is always equal to the\namount of the contractual obligation (i.e. a variable number of shares depending on the share price of the stock). As a result, the conversion options are part of the financial\nliability debt instrument and should be evaluated under the embedded derivatives guidance. Because the conversion options are indexed to the equity of the issuer, these are not\nclosely related to the host contract. This instrument is considered a new freestanding financial instrument and constitutes an embedded derivative liability that is separately\nrecognized as a liability and subsequently adjusted to its fair value at each reporting period, which is presented in the statement of operations.\nAs noted earlier, the Company converted loan notes totaling $809,692 (£619,315) into ordinary shares and warrants over ordinary shares such that no loan notes were\noutstanding as at December 31, 2023.\nDerivative liability\nWe evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC\n480 and ASC 815. Warrants that do not meet the criteria for equity treatment in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40 have been recorded as liabilities.\nAccordingly, we classify these warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjust the warrants their fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-\nmeasurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our statement of operations.\nPre-funded warrants\nThe Pre-Funded Warrants are classified as a component of equity because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately\nexercisable from the shares of common stock with which they were issued, are immediately exercisable, do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares,\nand permit the holders to receive a fixed number of ordinary shares upon exercise (foreign exchange on nominal value of the shares is not considered relevant for the analysis\nbecause not more than an insignificant amount related to the value of the share remains outstanding which is the $0.0001 nominal amount that remains open to be paid upon\nexercising it). In addition, Pre-Funded Warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return.\n81\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks in the ordinary course of our business, including, but not limited to, currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, as discussed\nbelow. We regularly assess each of these risks to minimize any adverse effects on our business as a result of those factors.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises\nprincipally from the Company’s receivables from customers and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange\ntransactions and other financial instruments. The Company only engages with banks and financial institutions with a Standard and Poor credit rating of BBB or greater. The\nCompany has a small number of customers as part of its collaboration agreements. To manage the credit risks around collaboration agreements, the Company will assess the\ncreditworthiness of partners as part of the engagement process. The Company has monitoring procedures in place to identify and follow up on any overdue debts. Credit risk\nfrom balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company’s finance department in accordance with the Company’s policy to only place funds with\napproved counterparties with the appropriate credit rating. The Company is exposed to no material credit risk.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that necessary sources of funding for the Company’s business activities may not be available. The Company manages liquidity risk by\nmaintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity\nprofiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Company is utilizing shareholder funds, collaboration agreements, grant funding and asset finance to support its working capital\nrequirements. All cash funds are held with a maturity of three months or less.\nMarket risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three\ntypes of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk.\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is\nnot exposed to any material interest rate risk.\nCurrency risk\nThe Company has transactions denominated in various currencies, with the principal currency exposure being fluctuations in U.S. Dollars and Euros against pound\nsterling. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company’s Convertible Loan Notes that are denominated in US\nDollars and a limited number of supplier agreements denominated in currencies other than pound sterling.\nEquity price risk\nThe Convertible Loan Notes issued by the Group contained an embedded derivative component that was accounted for at fair value at each period end. As such, a\nchange in the estimated underlying price per share impacted the valuation of the embedded derivative. The convertible debt was fully settled as of December 31, 2023.\n82\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nTC BioPharm (Holdings) plc\nAnnual Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 688) F-1\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 F-2\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 F-3\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 F-5\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 F-6\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements F-7\n83\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nTC BioPharm (Holdings) plc\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TC BioPharm (Holdings) plc (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31 2023, in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph – Change in Reporting Framework\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its reporting framework from International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by\nthe International Accounting Standards Board to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph – Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in\nNote 1, the Company, has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial\ndoubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audist to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,\nan audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum llp\nMarcum LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.\nNew York, NY\nApril 1, 2024\nF-1\nTC BIOPHARM (HOLDINGS) PLC\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents £ 2,462,609 £ 4,808,060\nCorporation tax receivable 1,043,593 1,720,000\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 2,194,725 919,456\nTotal current assets 5,700,927 7,447,516\nNon-current assets:\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net 1,274,798 1,761,171\nOperating lease right of use assets 1,340,769 1,530,274\nIntangible assets, net 615,170 553,016\nTotal assets 8,931,664 11,291,977\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 4,431,840 2,159,058\nConvertible loan -

However, as of June 30, 2023, the Company determined that, pursuant to the\ndefinition provided in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, it no longer satisfied the criteria to be considered an FPI. As such, beginning on January 1, 2024, the Company\nwas required to begin utilizing the SEC’s domestic reporting forms. A reconciliation from International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) to accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) has been presented (see Note 3).\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company changed its ratio of American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) ordinary shares from one ADS representing one ordinary share to\none ADS representing 20 ordinary shares (the “ADS Ratio Change”). As a result of the ratio change, all references in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes to units of ordinary shares underlying ADSs are reflective of the ratio change for all periods presented. In addition, the exercise prices and the numbers of ordinary shares\nissuable upon the exercise of any outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares were proportionally adjusted pursuant to the respective anti-dilution terms of the share-based\npayment plans.\nThe Company’s ADSs began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “TCBP” on February 10, 2022, following its initial public\noffering (“IPO”). As part of the IPO, the Company, issued 4,117 American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) representing 82,353 ordinary shares with nominal value of £41,176 and\nwarrants to buy 9,470 ADSs for proceeds before expenses of $17.5 million. Funding costs of $3.0 million including underwriter fees were incurred. On February 10, 2022, the\nCompany issued 3,164 ADSs representing 63,280 ordinary shares with nominal value of £31,640 and warrants to buy 6,278 ADSs on conversion of loan notes totaling $13.4\nmillion. Between June 7, 2022 and June 8, 2022, the Company issued and sold 11,500 ADSs representing 230,000 ordinary shares generating proceeds of $4.6 million before\ndeductions for offering expenses of approximately $0.8 million (£0.6 million).\nOn November 18, 2022 the Company undertook a reverse share split such that fifty issued ordinary shares were exchanged for one new ordinary share. As a result of\nthe share split, all references in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to units of ordinary shares or per share amounts are reflective of the reverse\nshare split for all periods presented. In addition, the exercise prices and the numbers of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of any outstanding options to purchase\nordinary shares were proportionally adjusted pursuant to the respective anti-dilution terms of the share-based payment plans.\nOn November 27, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “First Purchase Agreement”) with certain accredited investors (the\n“Investors”) as purchasers. Pursuant to the First Purchase Agreement, the Company sold, and the Investors purchased in a private placement an aggregate of 7,750 ADSs, pre-\nfunded warrants to purchase up to 65,750 ADS (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), Series A purchase warrants to purchase up to7 3,500 ADSs (the “Series A Ordinary Warrants”) and\nSeries B purchase warrants to purchase up to 73,500 ADSs (the “Series B Ordinary Warrants” and together with the Series A Ordinary Warrants, the “Ordinary Warrants”) for\naggregate gross proceeds of $7,350,000 (£6,073,376), excluding any proceeds that may be received upon exercise of the Ordinary Warrants. The purchase price for each ADS\nand associated Ordinary Warrants was $100 (on a post-split basis) and the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Ordinary Warrants was $99.98 (on a\npost-split basis).\nOn March 27, 2023, the Company, entered into a Second Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Second Purchase Agreement”) with Investors, pursuant to which the\nCompany agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 10,750 ADSs, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 161,125 ADS (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), and Series C purchase\nwarrants to purchase up to 171,875 ADSs (the “Ordinary Warrants” and together with the Pre-Funded Warrants and the ADSs, the “Securities”). In addition, the Company also\nissued placement agent warrants to purchase 12,891 ADSs. The purchase price for each ADS and associated Ordinary Warrants was $32 (on a post-split basis) and the purchase\nprice per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Ordinary Warrants was $31.98. The Ordinary Warrants were immediately exercisable, expire five (5) years from the date of\nissuance and the Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. The total net proceeds from this offering were\napproximately $4.9 million, after deducting estimated offering expenses of approximately $0.6 million.\nOn March 27, 2023 the Company also agreed that certain existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of1 40,000 ADSs of the Company that were previously\nissued on November 30, 2022, at an exercise price of $100 (on a post-split basis) per ADS and expiration dates of May 30, 2025 and May 30, 2028, were amended so that the\namended warrants had a reduced exercise price of $35 (on a post-split basis) per ADS.\nOn August 30, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with its Series A and B warrant holders whereby it induced 70,000 and 70,000 of the outstanding\nwarrants, respectively. In addition, the Company also entered into an agreement with its Series C warrant holders to induce all of the outstanding warrants (171,875). The\ninducement resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.8 million. In order to incentivize the inducement, the Company issued 623,750 Series D warrants to\nthe Series, A, B and C warrant holders. In addition, the Company also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 23,391 ADSs. The Company received aggregate gross\nproceeds of approximately £2.2 million (approximately $2.8 million) from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Holders, before deducting placement agent fees payable\nby the Company.\nF-6\nOn December 18, 2023, the Company entered into a Third Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Third Purchase Agreement”) with a certain institutional investor (the\n“Investor”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Investor in a best-efforts public offering 75,000 ADSs representing 1,500,000 ordinary shares, pre-\nfunded warrants to purchase up to 1,675,000 ADS representing 33,500,000 Ordinary Shares (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), and series E purchase warrants to purchase up to\n1,750,000 ADSs representing 35,000,000 Ordinary Shares (the “Warrants” and together with the Pre-Funded Warrants and the ADSs, the “Securities”). The purchase price for\neach ADS and associated Warrant was $2.00 and the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Warrant was $1.999. The Warrants are immediately\nexercisable, will expire five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of £1.5814. The Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-\nFunded Warrants are exercised in full at an exercise price of $0.001 per ADS. Additionally, the Company agreed that a certain number of existing warrants to purchase up to an\naggregate of 623,750 ADSs of the Company that was previously issued on September 5, 2023, at an exercise price of £7.00 per ADS and an expiration date of March 5, 2029,\nwere amended effective upon the closing of the offering so that the amended warrant will have a reduced exercise price of £1.5814 (or $2.00, as translated for illustration to U.S.\ndollars at the rate of £1.00 to $1.264 as of December 18, 2023) per ADS. The Securities Purchase Agreements resulted in gross proceeds of $3.5 million.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is exposed to a variety of risks in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, currency risk, liquidity risk, equity price risk and credit\nrisk. The Company regularly assesses each of these risks to minimize any adverse effects on the business as a result of those factors.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company has been focused on the development of therapeutic products based around its gamma delta T cell platform technology, with the objective of conducting\nclinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy and eventually being granted regulatory approval to market and sell its products since its incorporation. This activity was\nexpected to be in development for several years and has incurred considerable expenditures to date in research and development expenses and in conducting clinical trials.\nSimilar to most development and/or clinical stage biotechnology companies, the Company has not yet generated any revenues from sales of products, but has obtained cash to\nfinance its research, development and clinical trial activities from equity, debt and grant financings and from receipts from partners under collaborative co-development\nagreements. The Company is expected to continue in this clinical development phase for a number of years before any product becomes marketable. The Company therefore\nexpects to continue to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to £2.5 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of £1.0\nmillion. Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £10.5 million, and the Company expects to incur continued outflow of cash for the\nforeseeable future. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £5.9 million.\nOn March 22, 2024, the Group had cash on hand of $1.7 million (£1.4 million), which will not be sufficient to enable the Group to meet the cash requirements required\nto enable it to conduct its business plan through the going concern period (being to April 1, 2025) (“Going Concern Period”). With existing resources, we expect to be able to\nfund current operations to May 2024.\nSimilar to many clinical development stage biotechnology companies, the Company’s future liquidity needs, and ability to address them, will largely be determined by\nthe availability of capital, both generally and in particular to fund product candidates and key development and regulatory projects. As a pre-revenue biotechnology Company,\noperations have been financed though continuously raising capital, and management expects to continue to raise capital routinely. The Company is currently and continuously\nprogressing various funding options to fill the projected working capital gap, which could be in the form of an equity raise or other forms of financings such as debt funding,\ncollaborations or licensing arrangements. Management believes that the ongoing financing initiatives should provide sufficient capital to finance planned operations through\n2024, and thereafter we would expect to be in a position to raise significantly greater capital as the clinical program progresses. However, there can be no certainty that these\ninitiatives will be successful and, if they are not, management will seek to deploy alternative plans, which could have a potentially significant negative impact on stockholder\nand asset value. Such plans could include all or any of the following: raising additional capital through low priced and/or complex equity and/or debt financings, entering\ntransactions involving sales, joint venturing or licensing of intellectual property, reducing and/or deferring discretionary spending on research and development or clinical\nprograms, restructuring our operating model to take advantage of our manufacturing capability to generate short term revenues or reducing our cash burn rate through reduction\nin planned operating costs.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which assumes the realization of assets and the\nsatisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not established a source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, and as such, has been\ndependent on ongoing funding operations primarily through ongoing initiatives to raise capital. The Company expects to require substantially more capital to fund its clinical,\ndevelopment and operational requirements, and therefore incur further losses over the next several years as it develops its clinical products. The Company has utilized, and\nexpects to continue to utilize, substantial amounts of funding to implement its business strategy. If the Company is unable to maintain adequate liquidity, future operations will\nneed to be scaled back or discontinued. Based on these circumstances, management has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nF-7\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of\nthe financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, and the adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.\nPrincipals of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TC BioPharm and its 100% controlled subsidiaries, TC BioPharm Limited, TC BioPharm Inc. and TC\nBioPharm BV. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. “TC BioPharm”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us” is intended to mean TC\nBioPharm (Holdings) plc, including the subsidiaries indicated above, unless otherwise indicated.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to\nother public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\n404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from\nthe requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until\nprivate companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a\ncompany can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out\nis irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application\ndates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or\nrevised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s consolidated financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company\nnor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards\nused.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set\nof circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more\nfuture confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company operates in one operating segment. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Company’s chief\noperating decision maker (“the CODM”). The Company’s CODM, its Chief Executive Officer, views the Company’s operations and manages its business as a single operating\nsegment, which is the business of a clinical stage immune-therapy Group pioneering commercialization of allogeneic, ‘off-the-shelf’ gamma-delta T cell (‘GD-T’) therapies.\nF-8\nIncome and Other Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard\nCodification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events\nthat have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial\nstatements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates\non deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent they believe these assets will more-likely-than-not be realized. In making such determination, the Company\nconsiders all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning\nstrategies and recent financial operations. In the event the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of its\nnet recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nIncome Tax Credit\nThe Company carries out extensive research and development activities, where it benefits from the United Kingdom’s research and development tax relief and\nexpenditure credit regimes. The Company is able to surrender some of its income tax losses for a cash rebate of up to 33.35% of expenditures related to eligible research and\ndevelopment projects. Such credits are accounted for, depending on the appropriate tax relief, either within the tax provision or other income, in the year in which the\nexpenditures were incurred.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company defines cash and cash equivalents as cash on hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term liquid investments with maturities of three\nmonths or less. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents was £2.5 million and £4.8 million, respectively.\nConcentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains\nsubstantially all of its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not incurred any losses\nassociated with this concentration of deposits.\nThe Company currently has bank deposits with financial institutions in the U.S. of approximately £0.2 million as of December 31, 2023 which are below the FDIC\ninsurance limits. FDIC insurance provides protection for bank deposits up to $250,000. The Company had approximately £2.3 million in uninsured bank deposits with financial\ninstitutions outside the U.S. All uninsured bank deposits are held at high quality credit institutions.\nForeign currency translation and transactions\nThe Company uses the British pound sterling as the reporting currency for its financial statements. Functional currency is the currency of the primary economic\nenvironment in which an entity operates. The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries are the local currencies. The Company has transactions denominated in various\ncurrencies, with the principal currency exposure being fluctuations in U.S. Dollars and Euros against pound sterling. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign\nexchange rates relates primarily to the a limited number of supplier agreements denominated in currencies other than pound sterling.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consist of computer equipment, facility, and scientific equipment and office equipment, which are stated at cost, net of accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization, and depreciated over their estimated lives using the straight-line method.\nDepreciation is provided for by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nProperty and Equipment Estimated Useful Life\nFacility and scientific equipment 4-10 years\nComputer equipment 3 years\nOffice equipment 5 years\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When assets have been retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed\nfrom the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations.\nF-9\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets consist of software, patents and licenses. Intangible assets are recognized where it is probable that there will be a future economic benefit and that this\ncan be reliably measured. Software represents the historical cost of installation of third-party software used within the Company to maintain and control the Company’s quality\nsystem. The software is hosted and controlled on the Company’s servers and can be used independently of the related hardware. Software is amortized, on a straight-line basis,\nover the life of the relevant license of three to four years. Patent costs represent the costs of securing patents in relation to the Company’s intellectual property. Patent costs are\namortized, on a straight-line basis, over the remaining legal life of the relevant patents, which has an average estimated patent life of 16 years. License costs represent costs\nincurred for securing use of third-party technology. License costs are amortized, on a straight-line basis, over the life of the relevant license of three years. Amortization methods\nand useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as appropriate.\nThe Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets where there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If\nany such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). The recoverable amount is\ndetermined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets in which case the\nCompany estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-\nuse. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the\ntime value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-\ngenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment\nloss is recognized immediately in the statement of operations. There was no impairment of tangible or intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, approximates the carrying\namounts represented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nNet Loss per Share\nBasic net loss per share ordinary share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding in accordance with ASC Topic 260,\nEarnings per Share. Diluted net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential ordinary\nshares. When the Company reports a net loss, the calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential ordinary shares as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Potential\nordinary shares are composed of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants. The following table shows the basic and diluted loss per share for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet loss (5,906,953) (1,313,601)\nBasic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding(1) 6,178,423 687,199\nBasic and diluted loss per share (0.96) (1.91)\n(1) On November 18, 2022, the Company completed a reverse stock split of one (1) new share for every fifty (50) existing shares effective November 21, 2022. As a result\nof the share split, all references in these financial statements and accompanying notes to units of ordinary shares or per share amounts are reflective of the reverse share\nsplit for all periods presented. In addition, the exercise prices and the numbers of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of any outstanding options to purchase\nordinary shares were proportionally adjusted pursuant to the respective anti-dilution terms of the share-based payment plans.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements with employees, directors, and consultants and recognizes the compensation expense for share-\nbased awards based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. Compensation expense for all share-based awards is based on the estimated grant-date fair\nvalue and recognized in earnings over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period).\nF-10\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive\nin exchange for those goods or services. The Company accounts for revenue contracts with customers by applying the requirements of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers, which includes the following five steps:\ni. Identification of the contract with a customer.\nii. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract.\niii. Determination of the transaction price.\niv. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\nv. Recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company earns revenue from collaboration agreements and contracts with customers (see Note 4). Revenue is recognized on upfront collaboration payments on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated term over which the services promised will be provided. The Company is entitled to receive contractual milestone payments on\nachievement of certain performance obligations and these are recognized when the milestones are certain to occur.\nResearch & Development Expenses\nResearch expenditure is expensed in the year in which it is incurred. Identifiable development expenditure is capitalized to the extent that the technical, commercial\nand financial feasibility can be demonstrated. The Company has not capitalized any development expenditures since inception.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company accounts for contingencies in accordance with ASC 450-20, Contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are\nissued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such\ncontingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the\nCompany or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the\nperceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated\nliability would be accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is\nreasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and\nmaterial, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Further details are\nincluded within Note 9 to the financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements. Further, during\nDecember 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09-Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires entities\nto provide additional information in the rate reconciliation and additional disclosures about income taxes paid. The guidance should be applied prospectively and is effective for\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not expect the issued standard to have a material impact on its financial statements or results of\noperations.\nNOTE 3. CONVERSION FROM IFRS TO GAAP\nThe Company has retrospectively converted its consolidated financial statements from IFRS to GAAP. Refer to Note 1 for additional details.\nThe significant differences between IFRS and GAAP as they relate to these financial statements are as follows:\n(a) Leases\nUnder IFRS 16, the Company, as lessee, applied the single lease model that is similar to the accounting for a finance lease under GAAP. The expense recognition\npresented a higher portion of the total expense earlier in the term as a combination of straight-line depreciation of the right-of-use asset and the effective interest rate method\napplied to the lease liability which resulted in a decreasing rate of interest expense recognition throughout the lease term.\nF-11\nUnder GAAP, there is dual classification lease accounting model for lessees: finance leases and operating leases. Specifically, in accordance with ASC 842, the\nCompany, as lessee, must determine whether a lease is a finance or operating lease at the inception of the contract. Further, operating leases are recognized utilizing a single\nlease expense model, which takes the expected payments to be made over the life of the lease and recognizes those payments on a straight-line basis throughout the lease term.\nAs a result of the cutover from IFRS to GAAP, the Company began accounting for its office lease space as an operating lease (in lieu of the “finance lease” model\nunder IFRS 16). This resulted in the corresponding lease expense being reclassified from interest expense and ROU amortization into operating lease expense, which decreased\ninterest expense by £238,985 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally due to the change in the expense recognition method, the total resulting decrease in lease\nrelated expense from the transition from IFRS to GAAP was £76,105 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The expense for 2023 was recognized under GAAP and did not\nrequire any adjustments.\nThe following table summarizes the changes for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nIFRS Adjustments GAAP\nResearch and development expenses £ 7,447,506 £ 144,964 £ 7,592,470\nAdministrative expenses 7,013,056 17,916 7,030,972\nInterest expense (6,994,423) (238,985) (6,755,438)\nTotal Conversion Adjustments (76,105)\nNet loss £ (1,389,706) £ (76,105) £ (1,313,601)\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding, basic and diluted 687,199 - 687,199\nBasic and diluted net loss per share £ (2.02) £ 0.08 £ (1.91)\nThe following table summarizes the changes as of December 31, 2022:\nIFRS Adjustments GAAP\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nOperating lease right of use assets £ 1,188,947 £ 341,327 £ 1,530,274\nTotal Conversion Adjustments £ 341,327\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ (DEFICIT)\nNon-current operating lease liability £ 1,812,450 £ (15,615) £ 1,796,835\nAccumulated deficit (33,731,738) 356,942 (33,374,796)\nTotal Conversion Adjustments £ 341,327\nNOTE 4. REVENUE\nThe Company earned revenue from collaboration agreements and contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized on upfront collaboration payments on a straight-line\nbasis over the estimated term over which the services promised will be provided. Collaboration agreement revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as\nfollows:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRevenue from collaboration agreements £ — £ 3,844,532\nThe terms of business for payment on satisfaction of a performance obligation are typically 30-60 days. Collaboration agreements entered into by the Company provide\nfor the entity to work with a partner to carry out collaborative research and development work. Performance obligations around upfront payments are deemed to be satisfied\nover the estimated life of the services promised to be provided. This estimated life of the services was estimated by management at the inception of each contract and evaluated\nat each reporting date. During 2022, the contract with the collaboration partner was terminated. As such, the Company re-classed any remaining deferred revenue (from the\nupfront payment) to revenue as 1) no additional goods or services were required to be provided to the collaboration partner and 2) the upfront payment was non-refundable.\nRevenue from reimbursement of research and development costs by collaboration partners is recognized as the costs are incurred.\nF-12\nNOTE 5. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe Company’s property, plant and equipment balances consist of the following:\nFacilities &\nScientific Computer\nEquipment Equipment Office Equipment Total\nCost\nAt January 1, 2022 £ 4,889,662 £ 333,148 £ 86,331 £ 5,309,141\nAdditions 225,666 15,046 - 240,712\nDisposals (228,026) - - (228,026)\nAt December 31, 2022 4,887,302 348,194 86,331 5,321,827\nAdditions 91,724 18,629 - 110,353\nDisposals - -\nAt December 31, 2023 £ 4,979,026 £ 366,823 £ 86,331 £ 5,432,180\nDepreciation\nAt January 1, 2022 £ 2,636,772 £ 312,718 £ 60,996 £ 3,010,486\nDisposals (164,380) - - (164,380)\nDepreciation expense 683,592 15,098 15,860 714,550\nAt December 31, 2022 3,155,984 327,816 76,856 3,560,656\nDepreciation expense 575,233 13,947 7,546 596,726\nAt December 31, 2023 £ 3,731,217 £ 341,763 £ 84,402 £ 4,157,382\nNet book value\nAt December 31, 2023 £ 1,247,809 £ 25,060 £ 1,929 £ 1,274,798\nAt December 31, 2022 £ 1,731,318 £ 20,378 £ 9,475 £ 1,761,171\nDepreciation expense on these assets for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was £596,726 and £714,550, respectively, and is included in research and\ndevelopment and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred a loss on disposal of equipment totaling £8,646\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNOTE 6. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe Company’s intangible assets consist of the following:\nSoftware Patents and Licenses Total\nCost\nAt January 1, 2022 £ 49,613 £ 588,072 £ 637,685\nAdditions - 124,485 124,485\nAt December 31, 2022 49,613 712,557 762,170\nAdditions - 98,436 98,436\nAt December 31, 2023 49,613 810,993 860,606\nAmortization\n39,536 114,572 154,108\nAt January 1, 2022\nAmortization expense 7,125 47,921 55,046\nAt December 31, 2022 46,661 162,493 209,154\nAmortization expense 2,952 33,330 36,282\nAt December 31, 2023 49,613 195,823 245,436\nNet book value\nAt December 31, 2023 £ - £ 615,170 £ 615,170\nAt December 31, 2022 £ 2,952 £ 550,064 £ 553,016\nAmortization expense on these assets for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was £36,282 and £55,046, respectively, and is included in research and\ndevelopment expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nNOTE 7. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nThe Company’s prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nOther receivables £ 51,584 £ 56,264\nVAT owed to the Company 135,642 27,055\nPrepaid clinical trial costs 307,519 307,519\nDeferred clinical trial testing costs 1,177,500 -\nOther prepayments 522,480 528,618\n£ 2,194,725 £ 919,456\nThe fair value of trade and other receivables are not materially different to the book value.\nF-13\nNOTE 8. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\nThe Company’s accounts payable and accrued liabilities consist of the following:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nTrade payables £ 1,847,279 £ 882,364\nOther tax and social security 139,029 293,467\nAccruals 1,229,419 944,904\nAmounts accrued in respect to clinical trial testing 1,177,500 -\nOther payables 38,613 38,323\n£ 4,431,840 £ 2,159,058\nThe fair value of accounts payable and accrued expenses are not materially different to the book value.\nNOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject\nto inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business.\nIn accordance with the terms of a Convertible Loan Note (‘Note’) on August 9, 2022 (the Conversion Date) the Company issued 183,820 Ordinary Shares and 367,640\nlisted warrants to the Note holder in full satisfaction of the Note in the aggregate amount of $781,233. The holder filed a claim in the English courts on June 19, 2023 asserting\nthat notice was provided such that the Company should have paid it the value of the Note in cash, rather than by settling it through the issuance of Ordinary Shares and listed\nwarrants. The holder is demanding payment of the face value of the Note, together with interest, (approximately $860,000). The litigation process is in its early stages and is not\nexpected to conclude until late 2024 or later. The Company has retained English solicitors and is contesting the claim in its entirety. The Company believes that it acted\ncorrectly under the terms of the Note and has accounted for the transaction on that basis, and that no further amounts are payable to the holder.\nNOTE 10. LEASES\nThe Company leases certain office space under operating leases for use in operations. The Company recognizes operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over\nthe lease term. Management determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single component for all\nleases. Operating lease right to use (ROU) assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future lease payments over the\nexpected lease term, which includes optional renewal periods if we determine it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. As our leases do not provide an implicit\nrate, the discount rate used in the present value calculation represents our incremental borrowing rate determined using information available at the commencement date.\nOperating lease expense is included as a component of research and development and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded operating lease expense of £402,314 and £402,314, respectively. Cash payments on lease liabilities during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 totaled £447,015 and £763,487, respectively. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate were as\nfollows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term 5.11 years 8.2 years\nWeighted-average discount rate 8.6% 8.6%\nF-14\nThe following is a maturity analysis of the annual undiscounted cash flows reconciled to the carrying value of the operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024 £ 447,015\n2025 447,015\n2026 447,015\n2027 447,015\n2028 447,015\nLess imputed interest (433,919)\nTotal £ 1,801,156\nNOTE 11. CONVERTIBLE LOAN\nThe Company entered into a $20 million convertible loan note instrument in April 2021. The note has a5 % annual interest rate. During the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the Company converted loan notes totaling $809,692 and $14,228,245, respectively, into ordinary shares and warrants and repaid $0 and $3,195,765,\nrespectively, of the convertible loan note. The convertible loan was recognized as a hybrid financial instrument and accounted for as two separate components: (i) a loan and (ii)\nan embedded conversion option derivative. As of December 31 2023, the convertible loan had either been fully paid down or converted. As such, the balance of both the\nconvertible loan and corresponding embedded derivative was $0 as of December 31, 2023.\n(i) The convertible loan’s initial fair value was the residual amount of the consideration received, net of attributable costs, after separating out the fair value of the embedded\nconversion option derivative. The loan is subsequently measured at its amortized cost.\n(ii) The embedded conversion option derivative was initially measured at fair value and is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The embedded\nderivative could have been classified as a component of equity only if in all cases the contract would be settled by the Company delivering a fixed number of its own equity\ninstruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or debt redemption. That is, had the embedded instrument satisfied the “fixed-for-fixed” criteria outlined in ASC 815-40.\nHowever, the convertible instrument included a conversion feature resulting in settlement in a variable number of shares and consequently, was not considered indexed to the\ncompany’s shares (i.e. it did not qualify for the scope exception to derivative accounting outlined in ASC 815-40). As a result, the derivative is presented in the consolidated\nbalance sheet as a liability in accordance with ASC 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging-Embedded Derivatives. Changes in the fair value (gains or losses) of the derivative at\nthe end of each period are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn August 9, 2022, the Company agreed with one of the loan note holders not to exercise the right to require the loan notes to be repaid in cash in accordance with the\nterms of the loan notes and to amend certain other aspects of the loan notes (“2022 amended loan note”). As additional consideration, the Company has issued warrants to\nsubscribe for 11,678 ordinary shares in the share capital of the Company.\nIn accordance with ASC 470-50, the modifications to the 2022 amended loan notes represent a substantial modification as the amended debt instrument was considered\nsubstantially different (as compared to the original instrument) due to the following changes:\n(i) Removing the exercise of the right to require the loan in cash as of August 9, 2022.\n(ii) Extending the repayment date to January 31, 2023 and modifying the structure to be repaid in shares if not redeemed before in cash.\n(iii) Revising the conversion price for the conversion of the loan notes in shares. The revised conversion price would be $0.50 and would be based on the the 5-day trailing\nVWAP of the Company’s ADS if it is trading above that amount. Further, the conversion option would have a $0.20 as a floor.\n(iv) Giving the option to the holder for redemption in cash, which will occur no later than February 10, 2023 and to the Company for an early redemption at any moment but\nhaving the Holder an option to convert into shares using the revised conversion price at that moment.\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company agreed with the loan note holder not to exercise the right to require the loan notes to be repaid in cash in accordance with the terms of the\nloan notes and to amend certain other aspects of the loan notes (“2023 amended loan note”). As additional consideration, the Company has issued warrants to subscribe for\n200,000 ordinary shares in the share capital of the Company. This warrant contained a condition whereby if a registration statement, to be filed by the Company, registering all\nof the securities underlying the note holder’s amended convertible loan note, was not declared effective by July 31, 2023, the note holder will be entitled to receive 0.30\nOrdinary Shares for each share it was originally entitled to purchase under these warrants without the payment of any additional consideration. No such registration statement\nwas filed. The related fair value of the issue of any additional securities is approximately £29,000 ($37,000) and is not considered material to the financial statements.\nF-15\nThe modifications to the 2023 amended loan notes represent as substantial amendment as the modifications are related to:\n(i) A waiver to any defaults arising in connection with the 2022 amended loan notes.\n(ii) Extending the repayment date to January 15, 2024; and\n(iii) Amend the Conversion Price (as defined in the Loan Note) of the outstanding loan notes to be the lesser of $1.00 or the lowest closing price of the Ordinary Shares\nduring the ten (10) day period prior to the date the Noteholder delivers a notice of conversion to the Company, not to be lower than $0.20\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the convertible debt instrument during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nResidual loan Embedded Derivative Total\nBalance at December 31, 2022 £ 653,484 £ 2,439 £ 655,923\nAccrued interest 71,568 - 71,568\nRepayment (639,336) (2,439) (641,775)\nModification of loan notes (53,619) - (53,619)\nCurrency adjustment (32,097) - (32,097)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 £ - £ - £ -\nThe value of the embedded derivative was remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, based on the Black-Scholes valuation model, with recognition of the changes in\nfair value in the consolidated statements of operations. The inputs associated with calculating the fair value of the embedded derivative are considered to be Level 2. The\nfollowing inputs were used to determine the conversion option:\nDecember 31, 2022\nExercise price in USD $ 100.00\nShare price in USD $ 77.00\nTime to maturity 0.8 years\n90%\nExpected volatility\nRisk free interest rate (US treasury bond) 4.1%\nDividend yield -\nThe following inputs were used in the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the related share purchase warrants:\nDecember 31, 2023\nExercise price in USD $ 100.00\nShare price in USD $ 3.17\nTime to maturity 4.3 years\nExpected volatility 90%\nRisk free interest rate (US treasury bond) 4.5%\nDividend yield -\nF-16\nNOTE 12. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOrdinary shares\nThe Ordinary shares have no specific rights, preferences or restrictions attached to them.\nDeferred shares\nDeferred shares have the following properties:\na. do not entitle their holders to receive any dividend or other distribution;\nb. do not entitle their holders to receive a share certificate in respect of the relevant shareholding;\nc. do not entitle their holders to receive notice of, nor to attend, speak or vote at, any general meeting of the Company;\nd. entitles their holders on a return of capital on a winding up of the Company (but not otherwise) only to the repayment of the amount paid up on that share after payment\nof the capital paid up on each Ordinary Share in the share capital of the Company and the further payment of £100,000,000 on each ordinary share;\ne. do not entitle their holders to any further participation in the capital, profits or assets of the Company. The Deferred Shares shall not be capable of transfer at any time\nother than with the prior written consent of the directors of the Company.\nA Ordinary shares\nThe A Ordinary shares ranked equally with all other shares in issue in that on a vote every member has one vote for each share held. The A ordinary shares contain\npreferential economic rights such that, in the event of a share or asset sale (as defined in the Articles of Association), they provide a return to the holders of the A Ordinary\nShares of an amount greater than or equal to 1.5x the price paid by the investors for A Ordinary Shares. The A Ordinary shares have an anti-dilution provision where shares are\nsubsequently issued at a price below £215.00 per share, whereby the existing A Ordinary shareholders receive additional compensation shares in line with the formula set out in\nthe Articles of Association. The A Ordinary shares rank equally with all other shares in issue with respect to dividends.\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO, 493,860 ordinary shares were issued, under the terms of the Articles of Association to certain shareholders who, prior\nto the IPO, owned A Ordinary shares which carried the right, to subscribe at nominal value for a certain number of additional shares, calculated by reference to the pre-money\nvaluation of the IPO. As part of the IPO share issue, the Company re-organized its share capital whereby all of the outstanding series A ordinary shares were re-designated as\nordinary shares of the Company on a one for one basis and as such no anti-dilution provisions are included within the issued shares.\nReorganization and IPO\nImmediately prior to completion of the IPO, the Company re-organized its share capital whereby all of the outstanding series A ordinary shares were re-designated as\nordinary shares of TC BioPharm (Holdings) plc on a one for one basis. Immediately prior to the completion of the offering, a further 493,860 ordinary shares were issued, under\nthe terms of the Articles of Association to certain shareholders who, prior to the IPO, owned A ordinary shares which carried the right, to subscribe at nominal value for a\ncertain number of additional shares, calculated by reference to the pre-money valuation of the IPO. The fair value of the shares issued was £3.8 million.\nOn February 10, 2022, the Company issued 3,164 ADSs representing 63,280 ordinary shares with nominal value of £31,640 and warrants to buy 6,278 ADSs on\nconversion of loan notes totaling $13.4 million (£9.9 million).\nOn February 10, 2022, the Company completed the IPO, listing on Nasdaq, issuing4 ,117 ADSs representing 82,353 ordinary shares with nominal value of £41,176\nand warrants to buy 9,470 ADSs for proceeds before expenses of $17.5 million (£12.8 million). Funding costs of $3.0 million (£2.2 million) including underwriter fees were\nincurred.\nShare Issuances\nBetween June 7, 2022 and June 8, 2022, the Company issued and sold 11,500 ADSs representing 230,000 ordinary shares generating proceeds of $4.6 million (£3.7\nmillion) before deductions for offering expenses of approximately $0.8 million (£0.6 million).\nF-17\nOn August 9, 2022, Convertible Loan Noteholders with loan notes with a face value of $0.8 million (£0.6 million) agreed to not exercise their right to be repaid and in\nconsideration for this agreement received warrants over 233,560 ordinary shares. In addition, the conversion price of the loan notes was amended to be the lower of (i) the 5-day\ntrailing VWAP of the Company’s ADS calculated as at 31 January 2023 and (ii) $25.00, subject to not being below $10.00.\nOn August 9, 2022, the Company issued 183 ADSs representing 3,676 ordinary shares and warrants to buy 366 ADSs on conversion of loan notes totaling $0.8 million\n(£0.7 million).\nOn November 15, 2022, the Company issued 21 Ordinary shares (number stated prior to the reverse split) for a consideration of $7.565 (£6.362) per share.\nOn November 24, 2022, the Company issued 3 Ordinary shares for a consideration of $6.51 (£5.41) per share.\nOn November 27, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with certain accredited investors (the “Investors”) as\npurchasers. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company sold, and the Investors purchased in a private placement an aggregate of 7,750 American Depositary Shares (the\n“ADSs”), pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 65,750 ADS (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), Series A purchase warrants to purchase up to 73,500 ADSs (the “Series A Ordinary\nWarrants”) and Series B purchase warrants to purchase up to 73,500 ADSs (the “Series B Ordinary Warrants” and together with the Series A Ordinary Warrants, the “Ordinary\nWarrants”) for aggregate gross proceeds of $7.4 million (£6.1 million), excluding any proceeds that may be received upon exercise of the Ordinary Warrants. The purchase\nprice for each ADS and associated Ordinary Warrants is $100 and the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Ordinary Warrants is $99.98.\nOn March 27, 2023, the Company, entered into a Second Securities Purchase Agreement with Investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell an\naggregate of 10,750 ADSs, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 161,125 ADSs, and Series C purchase warrants to purchase up to 171,875 ADSs Securities. In addition, the\nCompany also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 12,891 ADSs. The purchase price for each ADS and associated Ordinary Warrants was $32 (on a post-split basis)\nand the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Ordinary Warrants was $31.98 (on a post-split basis). The Ordinary Warrants were immediately exercisable,\nexpire five (5) years from the date of issuance and the Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. The total net\nproceeds from this offering were approximately $4.6 million, after deducting estimated offering expenses of approximately $0.9 million.\nOn March 27, 2023, the Company also agreed that certain existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of1 40,000 ADSs of the Company that were previously\nissued on November 30, 2022, at an exercise price of $100 (on a post-split basis) per ADS and expiration dates of May 30, 2025 and May 30, 2028, were amended effective\nupon the closing of the Offering so that the amended warrants will have a reduced exercise price of $35 (on a post-split basis) per ADS. To account for the modification, the\nCompany recognized the increase in fair value of the modified warrants (measured as the difference between the fair value immediately before and after the modification) a as a\ncharge against the gross proceeds of the offering.\nOn August 30, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with its Series A and B warrant holders whereby it induced 70,000 and 70,000 of the outstanding\nwarrants, respectively. In addition, the Company also entered into an agreement with its Series C warrant holders to induce all of the outstanding warrants (171,875). The\ninducement resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.8 million. In order to incentivize the inducement, the Company issued 623,750 Series D warrants to\nthe Series, A, B and C warrant holders. In addition, the Company also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 23,391 ADSs. The Ordinary Warrants were immediately\nexercisable and expire five 5.5 years from the date of issuance. The Company received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately £2.2 million (approximately $2.8 million)\nfrom the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Holders, before deducting placement agent fees payable by the Company. The Company accounted for the inducement in\naccordance with modification and exchange guidance in ASC 815-40 and recognized the fair value of the issued Series D warrants as an equity issuance cost.\nOn December 18, 2023, the Company entered into a Third Securities Purchase Agreement with a certain institutional Investor pursuant to which the Company agreed\nto issue and sell to the Investor in a best-efforts public offering 75,000 ADSs representing 1,500,000 ordinary shares, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,675,000 ADS\nrepresenting 33,500,000 Ordinary Shares (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), and Series E purchase warrants to purchase up to 1,750,000 ADSs representing 35,000,000 Ordinary\nShares (the “Warrants” and together with the Pre-Funded Warrants and the ADSs, the “Securities”). In addition, the Company issued placement agent warrants to purchase\n131,250 ADSs representing 2,625,000 ordinary shares. The purchase price for each ADS and associated Warrant was $2.00 and the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant\nand associated Warrant was $1.999. The Warrants are immediately exercisable, will expire five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of £1.5814. Further,\npursuant to ASC 815-40, we concluded that the warrants were indexed to the company’s stock and should therefore be equity classified. The relative fair value of the warrants\nupon issuance were approximately $1.5 million. The Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full at an exercise\nprice of $0.001 per ADS. Additionally, the Company agreed that the Series E warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 623,750 ADSs of the Company that were previously\nissued on September 5, 2023, at an exercise price of £7.00 per ADS and an expiration date of March 5, 2029, were amended effective upon the closing of the offering so that\nthe amended warrant will have a reduced exercise price of £1.5814 (or $2.00, as translated for illustration to U.S. dollars at the rate of £1.00 to $1.264 as of December 18, 2023)\nper ADS. To account for the modification, the Company recognized the increase in fair value of the modified warrants (measured as the difference between the fair value\nimmediately before and after the modification) as a charge against the gross proceeds of the offering.\nF-18\nReverse share split\nOn November 18, 2022, the Company completed a reverse stock split of one (1) new share for every fifty (50) existing shares effective November 21, 2022. As a\nresult, the depositary bank, BNY Mellon effected a reverse stock split on the Company’s American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) program. Following the reverse split, a sub-\ndivision of every Ordinary share into one new Ordinary Share with a nominal value of £0.0001 and one deferred share with a nominal value of £0.4999 was enacted.\nAs a result of the share split, all references in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to units of ordinary shares or per share amounts are\nreflective of the reverse share split for all periods presented. In addition, the exercise prices and the numbers of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of any outstanding\noptions to purchase ordinary shares were proportionally adjusted pursuant to the respective anti-dilution terms of the share-based payment plans.\nADS Ratio Change\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company changed its ratio of ADSs ordinary shares from one ADS representing one ordinary share to one ADS representing 20 ordinary\nshares. As a result of the ratio change, all references in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to units of ordinary shares underlying ADSs are\nreflective of the ratio change for all periods presented. In addition, the exercise prices and the numbers of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of any outstanding options\nto purchase ordinary shares were proportionally adjusted pursuant to the respective anti-dilution terms of the share-based payment plans.\nNOTE 13. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nEnterprise Management Incentive (EMI) share option scheme\nThe Company operates an HMRC Approved Enterprise Management Incentive (“EMI”) share option scheme for employees. Effective December 16, 2014, the\nCompany approved a share option scheme under which the Board of Directors of the Company can award options to directors, officers, employees and consulting personnel of\nthe Company. The Board of Directors will determine the terms, limitations, restrictions and conditions of the options granted under the plan.\nThe Company has granted options over ADSs to certain employees.\nWeighted\naverage exercise price per\nADS\nNumber of share options £\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 5,329 £ 460\nGranted during the period - -\nExercised during the period - -\nForfeited during the period - -\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n5,329 £ 460\nExercisable at December 31, 2023 5,329 £ 460\nUnexercisable at December 31, 2023 - £ -\nThe estimated fair value of the options outstanding in the period was calculated by applying a Monte Carlo Simulation for those options issued in 2020 and 2019 and a\nBlack Scholes Model for those options issued in prior periods. The most appropriate approach is selected with reference to the share capital structure at the time of grant. The\nexpense recognized for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year ended December 31, 2023 was £0 as all options were fully vested as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n2021 Share Option Scheme\nEffective immediately prior to completion of the IPO on February 10, 2022, the Company adopted a new share option scheme, or the 2021 Share Option Scheme, for\nthe purpose granting share options to incentivize the Company’s directors, employees and consultants. The 2021 Share Option Scheme incorporates a sub-plan for option\nholders subject to taxation in the United States, or the 2021 U.S. Sub-Plan, to provide for the grant of U.S. qualified incentive options.\nF-19\nThe Company has granted options over ADSs to certain employees and directors.\nWeighted\naverage exercise price per\nADS\nNumber of share options $\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 2,615 $ 4,240\nGranted during the period 35,125 8\nExercised during the period - -\nForfeited during the period (674) 4,240\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 37,066 $ 230\nExercisable at December 31, 2023 36,782 $ 8\nUnexercisable at December 31, 2023 284 $ 4,240\nThe totals of options and related exercise price are for options over ADSs and reflect the ratio change on December 15, 2023.\nThe estimated fair value of the options outstanding in the period was calculated by applying a Black Scholes Model. The most appropriate approach is selected with\nreference to the share capital structure at the time of grant. The weighted average fair value of the options as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $62.12 and $1,068,\nrespectively. The expense recognized for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was £444,459 and\n£1,123,250, respectively.\nThe options granted under the 2021 share option scheme will typically vest over three years after the date of grant. In some cases, options granted to senior\nmanagement vested immediately. As of December 31, 2023 the unvested options would, under the agreed terms, vest evenly over the remaining period in either six month or\nannual installments.\nAdditional Right to Subscribe for Shares\nOn August 25, 2020, the Company issued Ordinary shares, which included an additional right to subscribe for a fixed number (15,891) of shares at £215.00 per share\nat a future date based on certain clinical and commercial milestones. The estimated fair value of the right to subscribe was calculated by applying a Black Scholes Model. This\nwas deemed the most appropriate approach due to the future liquidity event being date-uncertain and could take one of many forms.\nNOTE 14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with\nthe sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with\nmeasuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to\nclassify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\nLevel 1:Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or\nliability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2:Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted\nprices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3:Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of £2.5m as of December 31, 2023. The cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value due to the liquid nature of the\ninstruments and are measured in Level 1.\nIn addition, the Company also had numerous outstanding warrants that were classified in Level 2 due to our use of implied volatility in determining the expected\nvolatility input for purposes of determining the instruments fair value via the Black-Scholes valuation model. The details of the issued warrants were as follows:\nOn February 10, 2022, the Company completed its IPO and issued ADSs and listed warrants to buy ADSs. The ADSs and warrants are considered two freestanding\nfinancial instruments because each can be traded separately. The exercise price of the Warrants is $4,250 per ADS (on a post-split basis) and will expire on the sixth anniversary\nof the date of issuance. The exercise price is subject to standard anti-dilutive adjustments in the event of certain stock splits, stock combinations, stock dividends or\nrecapitalizations, and it is also subject to adjustment in certain events specified in the warrant agreement.\nF-20\nOn November 27, 2022, the Company entered into the First Purchase Agreement with Investors as purchasers. Pursuant to the First Purchase Agreement, the Company\nsold, and the Investors purchased in a private placement an aggregate of 7,750 ADSs, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 65,750 ADS (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), Series A\npurchase warrants to purchase up to 73,500 ADSs (the “Series A Ordinary Warrants”) and Series B purchase warrants to purchase up to 73,500 ADSs (the “Series B Ordinary\nWarrants” and together with the Series A Ordinary Warrants, the “Ordinary Warrants”) for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 7,350,000, excluding any proceeds that may be\nreceived upon exercise of the Ordinary Warrants. In addition, the Company also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 5,513 ADSs. The purchase price for each ADS and\nassociated Ordinary Warrants is $100 (on a post-split basis) and the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Ordinary Warrants is $99.98 (on a post-split\nbasis).\nOn March 27, 2023, the Company, entered into a Second Securities Purchase Agreement with Investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell an\naggregate of 10,750 ADSs, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 161,125 Pre-Funded Warrants, and Series C purchase warrants to purchase up to 171,875 ADSs Securities. In\naddition, the Company also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 12,891 ADSs. The purchase price for each ADS and associated Ordinary Warrants was $32 (on a post-\nsplit basis) and the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Ordinary Warrants was $31.98 (on a post-split basis). The Ordinary Warrants were immediately\nexercisable, expire five (5) years from the date of issuance and the Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full.\nOn July 10, 2023, the Company entered into a warrant amendment with an existing investor pursuant to which the Company and the investor agreed that certain Series\nA and Series B warrants to purchase 140,000 ADSs of the Company that were previously issued on November 30, 2022 (the “November 2022 Warrants”) and certain Series C\nwarrants to purchase 171,875 ADSs of the Company that were previously issued on March 30, 2023 (the “March 2023 Warrants,” and together with the November 2022\nWarrants, the “Existing Warrants”) would be amended as follows: (i) amend the current exercise price on all Existing Warrants so that it is now equal to £7.00, (ii) extend the\ntermination date on 50% of the November 2022 Warrants and all of the March 2023 Warrants until May 30, 2028 and (iii) amend to the definition of “Black Scholes Value”\nincluded in Section 3(e) of the Existing Warrants. As a result of the amendments to the related warrants (Series A, Series B and Series C) they were reclassified to equity as they\nno longer contained a strike price denominated in a foreign currency. Further, the Series A, B and C warrants were also re-measured to a fair value of $6.40 per warrant as of the\nmodification date using the Black-Scholes model with the following inputs:\nJuly 10, 2023\nExercise price $ 9.00\nShare price $ 9.00\nTime to maturity 4.8 years\nExpected volatility 90%\nRisk free interest rate (US treasury bond) 4.0%\nDividend yield -\nOn August 30, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with its Series A and B warrant holders whereby it induced 70,000 and 70,000 of the outstanding\nwarrants, respectively. In addition, the Company also entered into an agreement with its Series C warrant holders to induce all of the outstanding warrants (171,875). The\ninducement resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.8 million. In order to incentivize the inducement, the Company issued 623,750 Series D warrants to\nthe Series, A, B and C warrant holders. In addition, the Company also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 23,391 ADSs. The Ordinary Warrants were immediately\nexercisable and expire five 5.5 years from the date of issuance.\nOn December 18, 2023, the Company, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell an\naggregate of 75,000 ADSs, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,675,000 Pre-Funded Warrants, and Series C purchase warrants to purchase up to 1,750,000 ADSs Securities.\nThe offering resulted in gross proceeds of $3.5 million. In addition, the Company also issued placement agent warrants to purchase 131,250 ADSs. The purchase price for each\nADS and associated Ordinary Warrants was $2.00 and the purchase price per each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Ordinary Warrants was $1.99. The Ordinary Warrants\nwere immediately exercisable, expire five (5) years from the date of issuance and the Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants\nare exercised in full.\nWhile the Series D and Series E warrants are equity classified, there are remaining IPO, Series A and Series B warrants that are still liability classified. However, as a\nresult of being significantly out of the money, the fair value of the liability classified warrants was not material as of December 31, 2023.\nUnlisted warrants in issue\nSeries A warrants\nThe fair value of each of the warrants was approximately $0.37 and $51.60 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe inputs associated with calculating the fair value of the warrants are considered to be Level 2 and were valued using a Black-Scholes valuation model.

Each non-\nemployee director received an option to purchase 41,760 ADSs, or ADSs representing 835,200 Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $1.09 per ADS, which is equal to the\nclosing price of the Company’s ADSs on the Nasdaq Capital Market on January 31, 2024. Martin Thorp, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, received an option to purchase\n177,122 ADSs, or ADSs representing 3,542,440 Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $1.09 per ADS, which is equal to the closing price of the Company’s ADSs on the\nNasdaq Capital Market on January 31, 2024. Bryan Kobel, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer received an option to purchase 381,606 ADSs, or ADSs representing\n7,632,120 Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $1.09 per ADS, which is equal to the closing price of the Company’s ADSs on the Nasdaq Capital Market on January 31,\n2024. All share options that were issued vest immediately upon issuance.\nOn March 8, 2024, Bryan Kobel, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company agreed to (a) defer the payment of accrued but unpaid contractual pension benefits owed\nto him in the amount of $66,000 for a period of 9 months and (b) convert an aggregate amount of $24,760 of accrued but unpaid contractual pension benefits owed to him into\n476,153 ordinary shares, par value £0.0001 per share of Company, based on a price per share equal to the closing price of the Company’s ADSs on the Nasdaq Capital Market\non March 7, 2024 divided by twenty (20), or the ADS ratio.\nIn addition, the board of directors approved a grant of options to Mr. Kobel purchase 153,000 ADSs, or ADSs representing 3,060,000 Ordinary Shares at an exercise\nprice of $2.00 per ADS, which is a premium to the closing price of the Company’s ADSs on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 7, 2024. The options granted to Mr. Kobel\nwere issued under the Company’s 2021 Plan. All share options that were issued vested immediately.\nExercise of Series D Warrants\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company issued 623,750 ADS representing 12,475,000 ordinary shares of the Company upon exercise of outstanding Series D warrants\nresulting in gross cash proceeds to the Company of £986,398 (approximately $1,263,000).\nF-23\nItem 9. Changes and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the\nmaterial weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable\nassurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within\nthe time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide\nabsolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if\nany, within a company have been detected.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed\nunder the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we\nmay take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. Additionally,\nthis Report does not contain an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting since the Company, as a smaller\nreporting company and non-accelerated filer, is not required to provide such report.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework established in Internal Control—\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that\nour internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 was not effective.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over accounting for complex financial instruments (including in determining the appropriate valuation basis in areas\nrequiring significant judgement) during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, and in the accounting for our property leases on conversion from IFRS to\nGAAP, which remained unremediated as of December 31, 2023, prior to processing corrective adjustments to the financial information which is included in the financial\nstatements that are included in this Form 10K. After identifying the material weaknesses, we implemented measures designed to improve our financial control in the\naforementioned areas through early engagement with third party technical accounting experts and those measures are now in operation.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

Purpose and Scope\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and maintain a culture that\nemphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company’s pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this Clawback\nPolicy (this “Policy”), which provides for the recovery of erroneously awarded Compensation in the event of a Triggering Event (as defined below). Unless otherwise defined\nherein, the capitalized terms have the meanings set forth under “XIII. Definitions.”\nII. Administration\nThis Policy is designed to comply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent with, Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act, Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5608 and other regulations, rules and guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) thereunder, and related securities regulations and regulations of the\nstock exchange or association on which Company’s securities are listed (collectively, the “Listing Standards”). This Policy shall be administered by the Compensation\nCommittee of the Board (the “Committee”).\nAny determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding. In addition, the Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the\nListing Standards. The Committee hereby has the power and authority to enforce the terms and conditions of this Policy and to use any and all of the Company’s resources it\ndeems appropriate to recoup any excess Compensation subject to this Policy.\nIII. Covered Executives\nThis Policy applies to the Company’s current and former Covered Executives, as determined by the Committee in accordance with the Listing Standards.\nIV. Events That Trigger Recoupment Under This Policy\nThe Board or Committee will be required to recoup any excess Compensation received by any Covered Executive during the three (3) completed fiscal years (together with any\ninterim stub fiscal year period(s) of less than nine (9) months resulting from the Company’s transition to different fiscal year measurement dates) immediately preceding the\ndate the Company is deemed (as determined pursuant to the immediately following sentence) to be required to prepare a Covered Accounting Restatement (the “Three-Year\nRecovery Period”) irrespective of any fault, misconduct or responsibility of such Covered Executive for the Covered Accounting Restatement. For purposes of the immediately\npreceding sentence, the Company is deemed to be required to prepare a Covered Accounting Restatement on the earlier of (A) the date upon which the Board or applicable\ncommittee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have\nconcluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Covered Accounting Restatement; or (B) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company\nto prepare a Covered Accounting Restatement (each a “Triggering Event”).\nV. Excess Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery\nThe amount of Compensation to be recovered shall be the excess of the Compensation received by the Covered Executive over the amount of Compensation which would have\nbeen received by the Covered Executive had the amount of such Compensation been calculated based on the restated amounts, as determined by the Committee. For purposes of\nthis Policy, Compensation shall be deemed “received”, either wholly or in part, in the fiscal year during which any applicable Financial Reporting Measure is attained, even if\nthe payment, vesting or grant of such Compensation occurs after the end of such fiscal year. Amounts required to be recouped under this Policy shall be limited to the amounts\nreceived by the Executive on a pre-tax basis. The date of receipt of the Compensation depends upon the terms of the award of such Compensation. For example:\na. If the grant of an award of Compensation is based, either wholly or in part, on the satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal, then the\naward would be deemed received in the fiscal period when that measure was satisfied;\n-1-\nb. If the vesting of an equity award of Compensation occurs only upon the satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance condition, then the award\nwould be deemed received in the fiscal period when it vests;\nc. If the earning of a non-equity incentive plan award of Compensation is based on the satisfaction of the relevant Financial Reporting Measure performance goal,\nthen the non-equity incentive plan award will be deemed received in the fiscal year in which that performance goal is satisfied; and\nd. If the earning of a cash award of Compensation is based on the satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal, then the cash award will be\ndeemed received in the fiscal period when that measure is satisfied.\nIt is specifically understood that, to the extent that the impact of the Covered Accounting Restatement on the amount of Compensation received cannot be calculated directly\nfrom the information in the Covered Accounting Restatement (e.g., if such restatement’s impact on the Company’s share price is not clear), then such excess amount of\nCompensation shall be determined based on the Committee’s reasonable estimate of the effect of the Covered Accounting Restatement on the share price or total shareholder\nreturn upon which the Compensation was received. The Company shall maintain documentation for the determination of such excess amount and provide such documentation to\nthe Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”).\nVI. Method of Recovery\nThe Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the methods for recovering excess Compensation hereunder, which methods may include, without limitation:\na. requiring reimbursement of cash Compensation previously paid;\nb. seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\nc. offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\nd. cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\ne. taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Committee.\nNotwithstanding anything in this Section VI, and subject to applicable law, the Committee may cause recoupment under this Policy from any amount of Compensation\napproved, awarded, granted, paid, or payable to any Covered Executive prior to, on, or following the Effective Date (as defined below).\nVII. Impracticability\nThe Committee shall recover any excess Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such recovery would be impracticable, as determined by the Committee in\naccordance with the Listing Standards. It is specifically understood that recovery shall only be deemed impractical if (A) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in\nenforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded Compensation\nbased on the expense of enforcement, the Committee shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s)\nto recover, and provide that documentation to Nasdaq); (B) recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to the November 28, 2022 (before\nconcluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Committee shall obtain an\nopinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the applicable national securities exchange or association on which Company’s securities are trading, that recovery would result\nin such a violation, and must provide such opinion to the exchange or association); or (C) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which\nbenefits are broadly available to employees of the registrant, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a), and the regulations promulgated\nthereunder.\n-2-\nVIII. Other Recoupment Rights; Acknowledgement\nThe Committee may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to\nthe grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not\nin lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity\naward agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. The Company shall provide notice and seek written acknowledgement of this\nPolicy from each Covered Executive; provided, that the failure to provide such notice or obtain such acknowledgement shall have no impact on the applicability or\nenforceability of this Policy to, or against, any Covered Executive, other than as set out in the following paragraph.\nFor Compensation to be recovered in accordance with this policy the Company must have issued to the Executive, prior to the Compensation being paid or becoming vested, a\nletter, which shall constitute an amendment to the Executive’s employment contract (and shall be executed by a director of the Company, upon the authority of the\nRemuneration Committee, and the Executive), and which sets out (a) the form and amount of the Compensation which is to be awarded and is covered by this Clawback Policy\nand (b) the nature and amount of the Financial Reporting Measure(s) upon which the Compensation is awarded, including any linkage of the Compensation to the Financial\nReporting Measure.\nIX. No Indemnification of Covered Executives\nNotwithstanding any right to indemnification under any plan, policy or agreement of the Company or any of its affiliates, the Company shall not indemnify any Covered\nExecutives against the loss of any excess Compensation. In addition, the Company shall be prohibited from paying or reimbursing a Covered Executive for premiums of any\nthird-party insurance purchased to fund any potential recovery obligations.\nX. Indemnification\nTo the extent allowable pursuant to applicable law, each member of the Board or the Committee and any officer or other employee to whom authority to administer any\ncomponent of this Policy is designated shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or\nreasonably incurred by such member in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be\na party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to this Policy and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in\nsatisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her; provided, however, that he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to\nhandle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any\nother rights of indemnification to which such individuals may be entitled pursuant to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or\nany power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.\nXI. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall be effective as of the date the Policy is adopted by the Board (the “Board Adoption Date”). This Policy shall apply to any Compensation that is received by\nCovered Executives on or after December 1, 2023 (the “Effective Date”), even if such Compensation was approved, awarded, granted, or paid to Covered Executives prior to\nthe Effective Date or the Board Adoption Date.\n-3-\nXII. Amendment and Termination; Interpretation\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its sole discretion, provided always that any revised policy shall only apply to Compensation paid after the time that the\npolicy is emended; and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect and comply with further regulations, rules and guidance of the SEC and Listing Standards. The\nBoard may terminate this Policy at any time.\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. This\nPolicy is designed and intended to be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Listing Standards. To the extent there is any inconsistency between\nthis Policy and such regulations, rules and guidance, such regulations, rules and guidance shall control, and this Policy shall be deemed amended to incorporate such regulations,\nrules and guidance until or unless the Board or the Committee expressly determine otherwise.\nThis Policy shall be applicable, binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives to\nthe fullest extent of the law. For the avoidance of doubt, this Policy shall be in addition to (and not in substitution of) any other clawback policy of the Company in effect from\ntime to time or applicable to any Covered Executive.\nXIII.
