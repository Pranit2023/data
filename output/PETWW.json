Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nNovember 13, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/11021/pdf)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wag! Group Co. (the “Company” or “Wag!”; Nasdaq: PET), which strives to be the number one platform to solve the service, product, and wellness needs of the modern U.S. pet household, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Highlights:**\n\n  * Revenues decreased 39% to $13.2 million, compared to $21.8 million in the third quarter of 2023 – comprised of $5.4 million of Services revenue, $6.5 million of Wellness revenue, and $1.3 million of Pet Food & Treats revenue.\n  * Net loss was $6.3 million, compared to $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss was $1.9 million, compared to positive Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n“Our third quarter results were impacted by a highly dynamic marketing environment resulting in less efficient marketing spend in our Wellness and Pet Food & Treats businesses,” said Garrett Smallwood, CEO and Chairman of Wag!. “While we are disappointed with these results, we expect these challenges to be transitory, and believe we are positioned for a strong rebound in Q4 and into 2025. In fact, we saw growth in our Wellness revenue stream of 79% month over month in October, and the first couple weeks of November are continuing this trend.”\n\n“In the third quarter, we paid down $5 million of our debt balance, and we continue to have ongoing discussions with banks and private lenders to address our debt. We will also consider strategic asset sales for select products with a longer duration payback, and would expect to use such proceeds to further pay down our debt. We remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet, delivering strong fourth quarter results and returning to growth and profitability in 2025.”\n\n**Guidance**\n\nFor the fourth quarter 2024, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue in the range of $15 million to $18 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in the range of $(0.5) million to $0.5 million.\n\n\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue in the range of $70 million to $73 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in the range of $(0.5) million to $0.5 million.\n\n\n\nOur financial guidance includes the following outlook:\n\n  * We expect holidays to drive incremental overnight vs. daytime service demand, but also expect that severe weather will impact Services demand. Pet adoption during the holidays also positively impacts pet insurance penetration and demand for wellness plans.\n  * We anticipate that continued growth in the pet industry, driven by factors such as higher rates of pet ownership, pet insurance penetration, and increasing demand for premium pet products and services, will have a positive impact on our full year 2024 results.\n  * We have factored in potential risks and opportunities related to macroeconomic trends related to the state of the economy, interest rates, and consumer confidence in order to forecast our financial performance.\n  * We expect Sales & Marketing efficiency within the Pet category, our ability to manage CPCs and CPMs across key partners and advertising platforms, and our ability to manage search engine results and search engine optimization (SEO) within competitive keywords.\n  * We recognize that there may be potential risks to our financial performance in 2024, such as disruptions to global supply chains, changes in consumer behavior due to unexpected events such as a delayed or imbalanced return-to-office, digital and performance marketing trends, the potential impact of AI, and our ability to expand through partnerships.\n\n\n\n**Wag!’s****Third****Quarter Results Conference Call**\n\nWag! will host a conference call and live webcast today, November 13, 2024, at 8:30am ET to discuss financial results. Investors and analysts interested in participating in the call are invited to dial 1-800-717-1738 (international callers please dial 1-646-307-1865) approximately 10 minutes prior to the start of the call.

In addition, Wag! Group Co. operates Petted, one of the nation’s largest pet insurance comparison marketplaces; Dog Food Advisor, one of the most visited and trusted pet food review platforms; WoofWoofTV, a multi-media company bringing delightful pet content to over 18 million followers across social media; maxbone, a digital platform for modern pet essentials; and Furmacy, software to simplify pet prescriptions.

Additionally, we exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items which are not indicative of our operating performance as well as other transaction-specific costs that do not represent an ongoing operating expense of the business, including but not limited to, integration and transaction costs associated with acquired businesses, severance costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, and legal settlements. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between current, past, and future periods by excluding items from net income (loss) that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.\n\nPlatform Participant is defined as a Pet Parent or Pet Caregiver who transacted on the Wag! platform for a service in the quarter. Services include dog walking, sitting, boarding, drop-ins, training, premium telehealth services, wellness plans, and pet insurance plan comparison.\n\nInformation reconciling forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is unavailable to the Company without unreasonable effort. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because certain items required for such reconciliation are outside of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such a reconciliation would require a forward-looking statement of income, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The Company provides a range for its Adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved; however, it cannot accurately predict all the components of the Adjusted EBITDA calculation. The Company provides an Adjusted EBITDA forecast because it believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company’s results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words. Statements that are not historical in nature, including the words “anticipate,” “expect,” “suggests,” “plan,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimates,” “targets,” “projects,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “may,” “will,” “forecast” and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include those related to the Company’s ability to further develop and advance its pet service, product and wellness offerings and achieve scale; ability to attract and retain personnel; market opportunity, anticipated growth, ability to achieve and maintain profitability; intended use of proceeds from the Company’s underwritten public offering, and future financial performance, including management’s financial outlook for the future. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, including but not limited to: management’s financial outlook for the future; market adoption of the Company’s pet service, product and wellness offerings and solutions; failure to realize the financial benefits of acquisitions; the ability of the Company to protect its intellectual property; changes in the competitive industries in which the Company operates; changes in laws and regulations affecting the Company’s business; the Company’s ability to implement its business plans, forecasts and other expectations, and identify and realize additional partnerships and opportunities; and the risk of downturns in the market and the technology industry. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and the Company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. The Company does not give any assurance that it will achieve its expectations.\n\n**Contact Us**\n\nMedia: [_Media@wagwalking.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=w51b2EUKrJr_OPIDUv12knR6I9cgfQjpN5A9ELGTY4rRii0q6qvvOXrbx7iDiI3v5QPQhJ4jO3gzrsZsgeI6CeGK1dLPtYb72lZAAw3W6bU=)\n\n**Investor Relations**\n\nWag!: [_IR@wagwalking.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0_WqVvqivIDc0jWVJUSo0nbu3yQbMyR94Tbw7reUHyRJDQgJCP8f5O7CH2li8sLRPWqrAdk50ZlvoTJxRKHu0AwJgKNg1_0dsW_PnIr7uZ4=)\n\nGateway for Wag!: [_PET@gateway-grp.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8ZzoxFFn1Bhu2rPZnmLvbJAbcmDsvnu1qBi_0UOLu2kn6xkFRs1D5Nw6SlTnEXiIyG61VoD1AHryVmjMzMQcP_GALy68CAmrNP5HbmO2-wU=)[](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HhcEO6q_2g3r7TgKtAdZjcA6gZ9wGzsfZlDMvJvvG4M0-ZkvK1tuhGdesiYTC4xu-ENxKptHnmnDaVrCUfOXiQ==)\n\n**Wag!

(the “Company” or “Wag!”; Nasdaq: PET), which strives to be the number one platform to solve the service, product, and wellness needs of the modern U.S. pet household, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Highlights:**\n\n  * Revenues decreased 39% to $13.2 million, compared to $21.8 million in the third quarter of 2023 – comprised of $5.4 million of Services revenue, $6.5 million of Wellness revenue, and $1.3 million of Pet Food & Treats revenue.\n  * Net loss was $6.3 million, compared to $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss was $1.9 million, compared to positive Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n“Our third quarter results were impacted by a highly dynamic marketing environment resulting in less efficient marketing spend in our Wellness and Pet Food & Treats businesses,” said Garrett Smallwood, CEO and Chairman of Wag!. “While we are disappointed with these results, we expect these challenges to be transitory, and believe we are positioned for a strong rebound in Q4 and into 2025. In fact, we saw growth in our Wellness revenue stream of 79% month over month in October, and the first couple weeks of November are continuing this trend.”\n\n“In the third quarter, we paid down $5 million of our debt balance, and we continue to have ongoing discussions with banks and private lenders to address our debt. We will also consider strategic asset sales for select products with a longer duration payback, and would expect to use such proceeds to further pay down our debt. We remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet, delivering strong fourth quarter results and returning to growth and profitability in 2025.”\n\n**Guidance**\n\nFor the fourth quarter 2024, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue in the range of $15 million to $18 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in the range of $(0.5) million to $0.5 million.\n\n\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue in the range of $70 million to $73 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in the range of $(0.5) million to $0.5 million.\n\n\n\nOur financial guidance includes the following outlook:\n\n  * We expect holidays to drive incremental overnight vs. daytime service demand, but also expect that severe weather will impact Services demand. Pet adoption during the holidays also positively impacts pet insurance penetration and demand for wellness plans.\n  * We anticipate that continued growth in the pet industry, driven by factors such as higher rates of pet ownership, pet insurance penetration, and increasing demand for premium pet products and services, will have a positive impact on our full year 2024 results.\n  * We have factored in potential risks and opportunities related to macroeconomic trends related to the state of the economy, interest rates, and consumer confidence in order to forecast our financial performance.\n  * We expect Sales & Marketing efficiency within the Pet category, our ability to manage CPCs and CPMs across key partners and advertising platforms, and our ability to manage search engine results and search engine optimization (SEO) within competitive keywords.\n  * We recognize that there may be potential risks to our financial performance in 2024, such as disruptions to global supply chains, changes in consumer behavior due to unexpected events such as a delayed or imbalanced return-to-office, digital and performance marketing trends, the potential impact of AI, and our ability to expand through partnerships.\n\n\n\n**Wag!’s****Third****Quarter Results Conference Call**\n\nWag! will host a conference call and live webcast today, November 13, 2024, at 8:30am ET to discuss financial results.

Group Co. operates Petted, one of the nation’s largest pet insurance comparison marketplaces; Dog Food Advisor, one of the most visited and trusted pet food review platforms; WoofWoofTV, a multi-media company bringing delightful pet content to over 18 million followers across social media; maxbone, a digital platform for modern pet essentials; and Furmacy, software to simplify pet prescriptions.

Additionally, we exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items which are not indicative of our operating performance as well as other transaction-specific costs that do not represent an ongoing operating expense of the business, including but not limited to, integration and transaction costs associated with acquired businesses, severance costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, and legal settlements. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between current, past, and future periods by excluding items from net income (loss) that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.\n\nPlatform Participant is defined as a Pet Parent or Pet Caregiver who transacted on the Wag! platform for a service in the quarter. Services include dog walking, sitting, boarding, drop-ins, training, premium telehealth services, wellness plans, and pet insurance plan comparison.\n\nInformation reconciling forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is unavailable to the Company without unreasonable effort. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because certain items required for such reconciliation are outside of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such a reconciliation would require a forward-looking statement of income, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The Company provides a range for its Adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved; however, it cannot accurately predict all the components of the Adjusted EBITDA calculation. The Company provides an Adjusted EBITDA forecast because it believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company’s results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words. Statements that are not historical in nature, including the words “anticipate,” “expect,” “suggests,” “plan,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimates,” “targets,” “projects,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “may,” “will,” “forecast” and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include those related to the Company’s ability to further develop and advance its pet service, product and wellness offerings and achieve scale; ability to attract and retain personnel; market opportunity, anticipated growth, ability to achieve and maintain profitability; intended use of proceeds from the Company’s underwritten public offering, and future financial performance, including management’s financial outlook for the future. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, including but not limited to: management’s financial outlook for the future; market adoption of the Company’s pet service, product and wellness offerings and solutions; failure to realize the financial benefits of acquisitions; the ability of the Company to protect its intellectual property; changes in the competitive industries in which the Company operates; changes in laws and regulations affecting the Company’s business; the Company’s ability to implement its business plans, forecasts and other expectations, and identify and realize additional partnerships and opportunities; and the risk of downturns in the market and the technology industry. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and the Company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. The Company does not give any assurance that it will achieve its expectations.\n\n**Contact Us**\n\nMedia: [Media@wagwalking.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=w51b2EUKrJr_OPIDUv12knR6I9cgfQjpN5A9ELGTY4rRii0q6qvvOXrbx7iDiI3v5QPQhJ4jO3gzrsZsgeI6CeGK1dLPtYb72lZAAw3W6bU=)\n\n**Investor Relations**\n\nWag!: [IR@wagwalking.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0_WqVvqivIDc0jWVJUSo0nbu3yQbMyR94Tbw7reUHyRJDQgJCP8f5O7CH2li8sLRPWqrAdk50ZlvoTJxRKHu0AwJgKNg1_0dsW_PnIr7uZ4=)\n\nGateway for Wag!: [PET@gateway-grp.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8ZzoxFFn1Bhu2rPZnmLvbJAbcmDsvnu1qBi_0UOLu2kn6xkFRs1D5Nw6SlTnEXiIyG61VoD1AHryVmjMzMQcP_GALy68CAmrNP5HbmO2-wU=)[](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HhcEO6q_2g3r7TgKtAdZjcA6gZ9wGzsfZlDMvJvvG4M0-ZkvK1tuhGdesiYTC4xu-ENxKptHnmnDaVrCUfOXiQ==)\n\n**Wag!

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results\n\nAugust 7, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/10781/pdf)\n\nQuarterly Net Loss of $2.3 Million\n\nAchieved Record Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 Million\n\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 7, 2024-- Wag! Group Co. (the “Company” or “Wag!”; Nasdaq: PET), which strives to be the number one platform to solve the service, product, and wellness needs of the modern U.S. pet household, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights:**\n\n  * Revenues decreased 6% to $18.7 million, compared to $19.8 million in the second quarter of 2023 – comprised of $5.6 million of Services revenue, $11.5 million of Wellness revenue, and $1.5 million of Pet Food & Treats revenue. \n  * Net loss improved to $2.3 million, compared to $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA improved to $1.6 million, compared to $0.1 million in the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n\n\"Our Q2 results were highly intentional, as we scaled back on Sales & Marketing spend to increase near-term profitability while we focus on addressing our debt obligations once the prepayment penalty expires this month,” said Garrett Smallwood, CEO and Chairman of Wag!. “Strengthening our balance sheet, driving free cash flow and demonstrating consistent profitability are our key priorities, and we look forward to making progress on these objectives as move into the back half of the year.” \n\n“We also look forward to benefiting from an enhanced balance sheet as we continue to take the necessary steps to best position the Company for continued growth, profitability, and shareholder value creation.” \n\n**Recent Business Highlights:**\n\n  * 467,000 Platform Participants in Q2 2024, versus 549,000 in Q2 2023. \n  * Achieved record quarterly Adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million. \n  * Completed an underwritten registered public offering on July 18, 2024, the net proceeds of which were approximately $8.6 million which we intend to use to pay down debt upon prepayment penalty expiration on August 9, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Guidance**\n\n“In the second quarter, we delivered our highest quarterly Adjusted EBITDA, which was driven by our focus on cost management and operational efficiency,” said Alec Davidian, Wag! CFO. “Our ability to generate free cash flow will allow us to service our debt, improve our balance sheet and return to growth.” \n\nFor the third quarter 2024, we expect: \n\n  * Revenue in the range of $20 million to $24 million. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in the range of $1.5 million to $2.5 million. \n\n\n\nFor the full year 2024, as previously communicated on July 10, 2024, we expect: \n\n  * Revenue in the range of $92 million to $102 million. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in the range of $4 million to $8 million. \n\n\n\nOur financial guidance includes the following outlook: \n\n  * We expect holidays to drive incremental overnight vs. daytime service demand, but also expect that severe weather will impact Services demand. Pet adoption during the holidays also positively impacts pet insurance penetration and demand for wellness plans. \n  * We anticipate that continued growth in the pet industry, driven by factors such as higher rates of pet ownership, pet insurance penetration, and increasing demand for premium pet products and services, will have a positive impact on our full year 2024 results. \n  * We have factored in potential risks and opportunities related to macroeconomic trends related to state of the economy, interest rates, and consumer confidence in order to forecast our financial performance. \n  * We expect Sales & Marketing efficiency within the Pet category, our ability to manage CPCs and CPMs across key partners and advertising platforms, and our ability to manage search engine results and search engine optimization (SEO) within competitive keywords. \n  * We recognize that there may be potential risks to our financial performance in 2024, such as disruptions to global supply chains, changes in consumer behavior due to unexpected events such as a delayed or imbalanced return-to-office, digital and performance marketing trends, the potential impact of AI, and our ability to expand through partnerships. \n\n\n\n________________ 1 Information reconciling forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort, as discussed in our Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Operating Metrics section below. \n\n**Wag!’s Second Quarter Results Conference Call**\n\nWag! will host a conference call and live webcast today, August 07, 2024, at 4:30pm ET to discuss financial results.

In addition, Wag! Group Co. operates Petted, one of the nation’s largest pet insurance comparison marketplaces; Dog Food Advisor, one of the most visited and trusted pet food review platforms; WoofWoofTV, a multi-media company bringing delightful pet content to over 18 million followers across social media; maxbone, a digital platform for modern pet essentials; and Furmacy, software to simplify pet prescriptions.

Additionally, we exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items which are not indicative of our operating performance as well as other transaction-specific costs that do not represent an ongoing operating expense of the business, including but not limited to, integration and transaction costs associated with acquired businesses, severance costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, and legal settlements. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between current, past, and future periods by excluding items from net income (loss) that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. \n\nPlatform Participant is defined as a Pet Parent or Pet Caregiver who transacted on the Wag! platform for a service in the quarter. Services include dog walking, sitting, boarding, drop-ins, training, premium telehealth services, wellness plans, and pet insurance plan comparison. \n\nInformation reconciling forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is unavailable to the Company without unreasonable effort. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because certain items required for such reconciliation are outside of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such a reconciliation would require a forward-looking statement of income, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The Company provides a range for its Adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved; however, it cannot accurately predict all the components of the Adjusted EBITDA calculation. The Company provides an Adjusted EBITDA forecast because it believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company’s results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words. Statements that are not historical in nature, including the words “anticipate,” “expect,” “suggests,” “plan,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimates,” “targets,” “projects,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “may,” “will,” “forecast” and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include those related to the Company’s ability to further develop and advance its pet service, product and wellness offerings and achieve scale; ability to attract and retain personnel; market opportunity, anticipated growth, ability to achieve and maintain profitability; intended use of proceeds from the Company’s underwritten public offering, and future financial performance, including management’s financial outlook for the future. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, including but not limited to: management’s financial outlook for the future; market adoption of the Company’s pet service, product and wellness offerings and solutions; failure to realize the financial benefits of acquisitions; the ability of the Company to protect its intellectual property; changes in the competitive industries in which the Company operates; changes in laws and regulations affecting the Company’s business; the Company’s ability to implement its business plans, forecasts and other expectations, and identify and realize additional partnerships and opportunities; and the risk of downturns in the market and the technology industry. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and the Company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
