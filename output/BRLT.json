(“Brilliant Earth” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: BRLT), an innovative, global leader in ethically sourced fine jewelry, today announced that the [Science Based Targets initiative](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TWGvo8fhuCx7xXLckha1aAj25PbG00O3HIIDiqHbFppANuG8CsNKQrHQN-iAJmpjvvYfKaiRz196Q7ABCtrk2FyJg23ovk9pEX7Rm2uzVdg1MvmjW90PoN2dU3L05TIS) has verified the Company’s long-term target to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its operations (Scopes 1 and 2) and its supply chain (Scope 3) by 2050. This validation reinforces the Company’s commitment to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and addresses the urgent need to try to limit global temperature increases to less than 1.5oC, below catastrophic levels, in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\n“Many scientists believe that it is still possible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C, but that we are dangerously close to that threshold,” said Brilliant Earth Co-Founder and CEO Beth Gerstein. “The greenhouse gas emissions targets are a major milestone in Brilliant Earth’s journey to create a more ethical jewelry industry. We hope our transparency and goal setting encourages other stakeholders and industry players to align with climate science and commit to science-based net-zero targets. Together, we can be a force for positive change.”\n\nTo reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 2050, Brilliant Earth has set the following near and long-term targets:\n\n  * _Overall Net-Zero Target:_ reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2050\n  *  _Near-term_ _1_ _:_ reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 54.6% by 2033 from a 2023 base year and reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions 32.5% within the same timeframe.\n  * _Long-term_ _2_ _:_ reduce absolute Scope 1 GHG emissions 90% by 2050 from a 2023 base year and reduce absolute Scope 2 GHG emissions by 100% and absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions 90% within the same timeframe.\n\n\n\nFor nearly two decades, Brilliant Earth has pioneered industry-leading practices, including developing traceability standards for diamonds such as Beyond Conflict Free™. The validation of the Company's emissions reduction targets by SBTi affirms Brilliant Earth’s long-standing commitment to going beyond industry standards, working within internal operations and with suppliers alike to create lasting change.\n\n\"One of our top mission priorities is to contribute to collective climate-related solutions. We chose to align with SBTi because of the initiative's ability to provide clearly defined pathways to science-based net-zero targets for global companies and financial institutions,” said Brilliant Earth Vice President of Responsible Sourcing and Sustainability Allison Charalambous. “With SBTi, understanding how quickly and how much decarbonization is necessary unlocks action so that organizations across industries can play their part in combatting the climate crisis.\"\n\nBrilliant Earth has already been working towards its targets, including calculating greenhouse gas emissions since 2018. Through the use of Renewable Energy Credits, the Company has used this data to reduce its Scope 2 market-based emissions for energy use to zero since 2022. Long term, the Company's Scope 2 target is to increase direct sourcing of renewable energy. This strategy is already underway with new showrooms using renewable energy opening in 2024 and beyond.\n\nMore information about Brilliant Earth’s sustainability goals can be found at [www.brilliantearth.com/about/mission/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eYl2LN9pAPQvyHk4cJQ8AujUxnnD3YLxmbdC-goGXbctmaZ8tI1MuQmy8d6WQ3z0fJF876IZiJIIknWy39G5zGPL-bLAXzEGvy6EsjVgvfUbLyl8vXyzdDZurPmmDyTLbpqI9tP3l6ge-JusOuy-sw==) and progress towards the SBTi targets will be reported annually in the Company’s [Mission Reports](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Dp3zG2XaMPmmbMvQUDD2MGuj_UaALiKsoNGN5PQqDHGaYz2gEUGFKP7auiLtED3WoSK_MrJQ_K0mg2eSYFep-2FlsXWxX4E2gkwRV9oN036LflA1Nrfu-vMk-T1uz842).\n\n**About Brilliant Earth** Brilliant Earth is a digitally native, omnichannel fine jewelry company and a global leader in ethically sourced fine jewelry.

These non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful information in evaluating our operating performance and exclude certain items from net income that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from period to period.\n\nWe define EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of cloud-based software implementation costs, showroom pre-opening expense, equity-based compensation expense, certain non-operating expenses and income, and other unusual and/or infrequent costs, which that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of our core operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA calculated as a percentage of net sales. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which eliminate the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provide useful information to investors to assess the performance of our business.\n\nWe define Adjusted Net income as net (loss) income adjusted for the impact of certain additional non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of our core operations. These items include showroom pre-opening expense, equity-based compensation expense, costs to fund the Brilliant Earth Foundation and transaction costs and other expenses. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net income, divided by the diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding. The diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding is derived from the historical diluted weighted average shares of common stock assuming such shares were outstanding for the entirety of the period presented. We believe Adjusted Net income and Adjusted diluted Earnings Per Share, which eliminate the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provide useful information to investors to assess the performance of our business.\n\nPlease refer to “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” located in the financial supplement in this release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information.\n\nThis release includes forward-looking guidance for certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. These measures will differ from net (loss) income, determined in accordance with GAAP, in ways similar to those described in the reconciliations at the end of this release. We are not able to provide, without unreasonable effort, guidance for net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, or a reconciliation of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because the Company is not able to predict with reasonable certainty the amount or nature of all items that will be included in net income.\n\nThis press release also contains certain key business metrics which are used to evaluate our business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We define Bookings for each period as the dollar value of confirmed orders as of the date of order placement. We believe Bookings, which represent a measure of gross sales and potential future Net Sales, provide useful information to investors to assess the performance of our business. We define total orders as the total number of customer orders delivered less total orders returned in a given period (excluding those repair, resize, and other orders which have no revenue). We view total orders as a key indicator of the velocity of our business and an indication of the desirability of our products to our customers. Total orders, together with AOV, is an indicator of the net sales we expect to recognize in a given period. Total orders may fluctuate based on the number of visitors to our website and showrooms, and our ability to convert these visitors to customers. We believe that total orders is a measure that is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in an analysis of ongoing operating trends. We define average order value, or AOV, as net sales in a given period divided by total orders in that period. We define average selling price, or ASP, as the total retail sales price of products sold in a given period divided by the total number of product units sold during that same period. We believe that AOV and ASP are measures that are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in an analysis of ongoing operating trends. AOV varies depending on the product type and number of items per order. AOV and ASP may also fluctuate as we expand into and increase our presence in additional product types and price points, and open additional showrooms.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

With 2023 full year Net Sales of $446 million and 13 consecutive quarters of positive adjusted EBITDA since its initial public offering in 2021, the Company’s mission since its 2005 founding has been to create a more transparent, sustainable, and compassionate jewelry industry. Headquartered in San Francisco, CA and Denver, CO, Brilliant Earth has more than 35 showrooms across the United States and has served customers in over 50 countries worldwide. \n\n**Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Metrics**\n\nIn addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA margin. These non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful information in evaluating our operating performance and exclude certain items from net income that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from period to period.\n\nWe define EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of cloud-based software implementation costs, showroom pre-opening expense, equity-based compensation expense, certain non-operating expenses and income, and other unusual and/or infrequent costs, which that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of our core operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA calculated as a percentage of net sales. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which eliminate the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provide useful information to investors to assess the performance of our business.\n\nWe define Adjusted Net income as net (loss) income adjusted for the impact of certain additional non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of our core operations. These items include showroom pre-opening expense, equity-based compensation expense, costs to fund the Brilliant Earth Foundation and transaction costs and other expenses. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net income, divided by the diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding. The diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding is derived from the historical diluted weighted average shares of common stock assuming such shares were outstanding for the entirety of the period presented. We believe Adjusted Net income and Adjusted diluted Earnings Per Share, which eliminate the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provide useful information to investors to assess the performance of our business.\n\nPlease refer to “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” located in the financial supplement in this release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information.\n\nThis release includes forward-looking guidance for certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. These measures will differ from net (loss) income, determined in accordance with GAAP, in ways similar to those described in the reconciliations at the end of this release. We are not able to provide, without unreasonable effort, guidance for net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, or a reconciliation of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because the Company is not able to predict with reasonable certainty the amount or nature of all items that will be included in net income.\n\nThis press release also contains certain key business metrics which are used to evaluate our business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We define Bookings for each period as the dollar value of confirmed orders as of the date of order placement. We believe Bookings, which represent a measure of gross sales and potential future Net Sales, provide useful information to investors to assess the performance of our business. We define total orders as the total number of customer orders delivered less total orders returned in a given period (excluding those repair, resize, and other orders which have no revenue). We view total orders as a key indicator of the velocity of our business and an indication of the desirability of our products to our customers. Total orders, together with AOV, is an indicator of the net sales we expect to recognize in a given period. Total orders may fluctuate based on the number of visitors to our website and showrooms, and our ability to convert these visitors to customers. We believe that total orders is a measure that is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in an analysis of ongoing operating trends. We define average order value, or AOV, as net sales in a given period divided by total orders in that period. We define average selling price, or ASP, as the total retail sales price of products sold in a given period divided by the total number of product units sold during that same period. We believe that AOV and ASP are measures that are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in an analysis of ongoing operating trends. AOV varies depending on the product type and number of items per order. AOV and ASP may also fluctuate as we expand into and increase our presence in additional product types and price points, and open additional showrooms.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
