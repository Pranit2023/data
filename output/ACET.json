(Nasdaq: ACET), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer, today announced the opening of enrollment for the Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating ADI-270 in patients with metastatic/advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). \n\n“Solid tumors represent one of the highest unmet medical needs in oncology and have yet to benefit from the breakthroughs observed with CAR T cell therapies in hematologic malignancies. Emerging data from ADI-270, our armored allogeneic 'off the shelf' gamma delta 1 CAR T cell therapy targeting CD70 positive cancers, have shown potential in addressing this gap,” said Chen Schor, President and Chief Executive Officer. “At the recent ASGCT conference, we presented preclinical data in which ADI-270 demonstrated significant tumor infiltration, resistance to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and potent activity via CAR and innate-mediated targeting, highlighting its potential for treating solid tumors. We look forward to enrolling patients and anticipate sharing preliminary clinical data from the trial in the first half of 2025.” \n\n**About the Phase 1 Trial**\n\nThe Phase 1 multicenter, open-label clinical trial is designed to investigate ADI-270 as monotherapy in adults with relapsed or refractory ccRCC. Following lymphodepletion, patients will be eligible to receive a single dose of ADI-270 with a starting dose level of 3E8 CAR+ cells. Subject to meeting protocol defined criteria, patients enrolled in the trial may be eligible to receive a second dose of ADI-270. The dose escalation and dose expansion portions of the trial will evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics as well as anti-tumor activity as assessed by overall response rate, duration of response and disease control rate. \n\n**About ADI-270**\n\nADI-270 is an armored allogeneic “off-the-shelf” gamma delta CAR T cell therapy candidate targeting CD70-positive cancers. CD70 is a compelling target due to its high expression in both solid and hematological malignancies. ADI-270 is engineered with a third-generation CAR designed to target CD70 using its natural receptor, CD27, as the binding moiety and is further armored with a dominant negative form of the transforming growth factor-β receptor II (dnTGFβRII) to provide functional resilience to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. ADI-270 is also designed to increase exposure and persistence by reducing susceptibility to host vs. graft elimination. These properties of ADI-270 combined with the potent tumor infiltration demonstrated with gamma delta 1 T cells aim to improve clinical responses of RCC patients and other patients with CD70+ tumors. \n\n**About Renal Cell Carcinoma**\n\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common tumor of the kidney, constituting 80% to 85% of primary renal neoplasms. Clear cell RCCs (ccRCC) are the most common subtype, accounting for 80% of all RCCs. ccRCC is an aggressive subtype arising from renal stem cells commonly arising in the proximal nephron and tubular epithelium, and often metastasizes to the lungs, liver, and bones. Approximately 20% of newly diagnosed cases of RCC are locally advanced or metastatic and up to 30% of patients will develop metastatic disease following nephrectomy. While the 5-year survival rate for localized RCC is 93%, the 5-year survival rate for advanced disease is 15%. \n\n**About Adicet Bio, Inc.**\n\nAdicet Bio, Inc. is a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer. Adicet is advancing a pipeline of “off-the-shelf” gamma delta T cells, engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), to facilitate durable activity in patients.

(Nasdaq: ACET), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic, gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer, today announced that clinical biomarker data from the ADI-001 Phase 1 GLEAN trial which demonstrates robust tissue homing, significant CAR T cell activation, and complete CD19+ B cell depletion in secondary lymphoid tissue will be featured in an oral session at ACR Convergence 2024 in Washington, D.C., November 14-19. \n\n“We believe the key to advancing care for autoimmune patients is to develop a therapeutic candidate that demonstrates robust tissue homing, complete CD19+ B cell depletion in tissue, and superior drug exposure in secondary lymphoid tissue with a positive safety profile. We are proud to share data and analyses, including clinical biomarker data, at ACR that support the potential of ADI-001 in autoimmune diseases,” said Francesco Galimi, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer. “After activating clinical trial sites for LN and receiving investigational new drug application (IND) clearances to pursue additional autoimmune indications, we are committed to advancing ADI-001 in a basket study across six autoimmune indications. This strategy highlights our focus on addressing the significant unmet medical needs of patients who urgently require innovative and effective new treatment options.” \n\nA summary of the results is reported below: \n\n  * ADI-001 demonstrated significant levels of CAR T cell activation and tissue exposure in lymph node biopsies in the GLEAN trial, representing a range of 27-64% of total cellular material detected by ddPCR in evaluable biopsies at the 1E9 dose, and exceeding levels previously reported for patients who received autologous alpha-beta CAR T therapies. CAR T cells detected in tissues also demonstrated a robust activation profile, based on in situ levels of granzyme B. \n    * Recently published studies have demonstrated depletion of CD19+ plasmablasts, memory B cells and naïve B cells in peripheral blood using anti-CD20 targeted antibodies, however, these CD20-targeted antibody modalities failed to fully deplete B cells within secondary lymphoid tissue. \n  * Concurrent with ADI-001 tissue trafficking and activation, complete depletion of CD19+ B cells within analyzed lymph node tissue was also observed. These results support ADI-001’s potential for achieving complete B-cell depletion in peripheral blood and within tissues. \n\n\n\n**Details of the oral presentation**\n\n**Title:** ADI-001: An Allogeneic CD20-targeted γδ CAR T Cell Therapy with Potential for Improved Tissue Homing in Autoimmune Indications **Session Name:** Abstracts: Miscellaneous Rheumatic & Inflammatory Diseases II **Abstract Number:** 1866169 **Presenting Author:** Monica Moreno, Ph.D. **Date and Time:** November 19, 2024; 12:00 p.m. – 12:15 p.m. ET\n\n**About ADI-001 in Autoimmune Diseases**\n\nADI-001is aninvestigational allogeneic gamma delta CAR T cell therapy targeting B-cells via an anti-CD20 CAR.
