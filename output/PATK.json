For the first nine months of 2024, adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points to 7.8%.\n  * Net income increased 3% to $41 million. Diluted earnings per share of $1.80 included the dilutive impact of our convertible notes and related warrants in the period, or an estimated $0.06 per share.

(NASDAQ: PATK) (\"Patrick\" or the \"Company\"), a leading component solutions provider for the Outdoor Enthusiast and Housing markets, today reported financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 29, 2024.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Patrick Industries, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/551056/Patrick_Industries_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/551056/Patrick_Industries_Logo.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nNet sales increased 6% to $919 million, an increase of $53 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The growth in net sales was due to a 13% increase in Housing revenue coupled with revenue gains from our Sportech acquisition, which closed in January of this year. These factors more than offset a 21% decline in Marine revenue as marine OEMs as well as OEMs across our other Outdoor Enthusiast markets continued to maintain highly disciplined production schedules in an effort to manage dealer inventory in alignment with current end market demand.\n\nOperating income of $74 million in the third quarter of 2024 increased $3 million, or 5%, compared to $71 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating margin of 8.1% decreased 10 basis points compared to 8.2% in the same period a year ago, reflecting higher SG&A expenses and amortization costs related to acquisitions. For the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, excluding acquisition transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments in both periods, adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points to 7.8%.\n\nNet income increased 3% to $41 million, compared to $40 million in the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share of $1.80 in the third quarter of 2024 included approximately $0.06 of dilution from our convertible notes and related warrants. There was no dilutive impact from the convertible notes in the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, excluding acquisition transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments in both periods, adjusted net income increased 14% to $128 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $5.75. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2024 included approximately $0.10 of dilution from our 2028 convertible notes and related warrants. The prior year period included approximately $0.05 of dilution related to our 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, which were repaid in cash in February 2023. \n\n\"The Patrick team delivered another quarter of solid results with revenue and net income growth supported by the continued diversification of our business,\" said Andy Nemeth, Chief Executive Officer. \"The resilience of our model is directly related to the dedication and talent of our incredible team members, and the strategic investments we have made enabling Patrick to perform well during a prolonged period of inventory destocking that has continued to affect our Outdoor Enthusiast end markets at different times over the last two years.\"\n\nJeff Rodino, President â RV, said, \"This quarter, we welcomed RecPro into our family of brands, which meaningfully expands our position in the direct-to-consumer RV and enthusiast aftermarket. We are energized by the depth and breadth of their product offering, the synergies across our business, and their tremendous leadership and expertise in e-commerce and aftermarket sales. We believe RecPro's efficient distribution channel and significant consumer reach will substantially enhance our ability to provide Patrick's valuable aftermarket solutions across all of our end markets.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Revenue by Market Sector** _(compared to Third Quarter 2023 unless otherwise noted)_\n\n**RV** (43% of Revenue)\n\n  * Revenue of $396 million decreased 1% while wholesale RV industry unit shipments increased 6%.\n  * Content per wholesale RV unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) decreased by 1% to $4,887. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, content per wholesale RV unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) decreased 2%.\n\n\n\n**Marine**(15% of Revenue)\n\n  * Revenue of $136 million decreased 21% while estimated wholesale powerboat industry unit shipments decreased 23%. Our Marine end market revenue previously included Powersports revenue, which we began to report separately following the Sportech acquisition. End market revenue and content per unit reflect this change for the relevant periods.\n  * Estimated content per wholesale powerboat unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) decreased 6% to $3,936. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, estimated content per wholesale powerboat unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) was flat.\n\n\n\n**Powersports**(10% of Revenue)\n\n  * Revenue of $87 million increased 204%, driven primarily by the acquisition of Sportech in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**Housing** (32% of Revenue, comprised of Manufactured Housing (\"MH\") and Industrial)\n\n  * Revenue of $300 million increased 13%; estimated wholesale MH industry unit shipments increased 17%; total housing starts decreased 3%.\n  * Estimated content per wholesale MH unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) increased 1% to $6,518. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, estimated content per wholesale MH unit increased 1%.\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Capital Allocation**\n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $224 million compared to $294 million for the prior year period, with the change primarily driven by investments in working capital. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $18 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting maintenance capital expenditures and continued investments in alignment with our automation and technology initiatives. On a trailing twelve-month basis, free cash flow through the third quarter of 2024 was $277 million, compared to $412 million through the third quarter of 2023 when we aggressively monetized working capital in a declining sales environment. Our long-term debt increased approximately $70 million during the third quarter of 2024, primarily as the result of the RecPro acquisition, which closed on September 6, 2024.\n\nWe remained disciplined in allocating and deploying capital, returning approximately $12 million to shareholders in the third quarter of 2024 through dividends. We remain opportunistic on share repurchases and had $78 million left authorized under our current share repurchase plan at the end of the third quarter.\n\nOur total debt at the end of the third quarter was approximately $1.4 billion, resulting in a total net leverage ratio of 2.6x (as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement). Available liquidity, comprised of borrowing availability under our credit facility and cash on hand, was approximately $458 million.\n\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, we reduced our cost of debt and increased our liquidity position by issuing $500 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2032 and expanding the capacity of our credit facility to $1.0 billion, while extending the maturity date to October 2029. We plan to use a portion of the proceeds from these transactions to redeem our 7.500% Senior Notes on November 7, 2024. Following these transactions, the Company's next major debt maturity will be in 2028. \n\n**Business Outlook and Summary**\n\n\"Our team remains confident in the strength of our brand portfolio, disciplined operating model, earnings power of the business, and the profitable runway of opportunity that exists in each of our primary end markets,\" continued Mr. Nemeth. \"We are intensely focusing on elevating the customer experience, invigorating our team's entrepreneurial spirit, winning additional market share by exceeding customer expectations, and growing the business through accretive acquisitions while strategically allocating capital toward automation and innovation initiatives. Over the last year, the teams at Patrick, in collaboration with our Advanced Product Group, have significantly expanded our product development and prototyping activities as a way to bring next-generation solutions to our customers over the next few years. We are optimistic that a positive demand inflection will occur in 2025, and believe recent interest rate reductions, lower inflation levels and continued solid economic data are important ingredients to bring this recovery to fruition, at which point our business is sized and scaled to pivot in alignment with our customers' needs. We are deeply appreciative of the incredible commitment and dedication of our team members and energized by their efforts and drive each and every day.\"\n\n**Conference Call Webcast**\n\nPatrick Industries will host an online webcast of its third quarter 2024 earnings conference call that can be accessed on the Company's website, [www.patrickind.com](http://www.patrickind.com), under \"For Investors,\" on Thursday, October 31, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

These metrics should not be considered alternatives to U.S. GAAP. Our computations of net leverage ratio, content per unit, free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted dilutive EPS, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA margin and available liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Content per unit metrics are generally calculated using our market sales divided by Company estimates based on third-party measures of industry volume. We calculate EBITDA by adding back depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, and income tax expense to net income. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by taking EBITDA and adding back stock-based compensation and loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, acquisition related costs, acquisition-related fair-value inventory step-up adjustments and subtracting out gain on sale of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted net income is calculated by removing the impact of acquisition related transaction costs, net of tax and acquisition-related fair-value inventory step-up adjustments, net of tax. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated as adjusted net income divided by our weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted operating margin is calculated by removing the impact of acquisition related transaction costs and acquisition-related fair-value inventory step-up adjustments. We calculate free cash flow by subtracting cash paid for purchases of property, plant and equipment from cash flow from operations. RV wholesale unit shipments are provided by the RV Industry Association. Marine wholesale unit shipments are Company estimates based on data provided by the National Marine Manufacturers Association. MH wholesale unit shipments are provided by the Manufactured Housing Institute. Housing starts are provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. You should not consider these metrics in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:  \n---  \n**Third Quarter Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n_($ in thousands)_ |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \nNet income |  $ 40,866 |  $ 39,550 |  $ 123,843 |  $ 112,080  \n+ Depreciation & amortization |  42,186 |  36,484 |  124,002 |  107,976  \n+ Interest expense, net |  20,050 |  16,879 |  60,483 |  53,623  \n+ Income taxes |  13,501 |  14,646 |  34,122 |  37,181  \nEBITDA |  116,603 |  107,559 |  342,450 |  310,860  \n+ Stock-based compensation |  4,625 |  5,729 |  14,367 |  13,675  \n+ Acquisition related transaction costs |  â |  â |  4,998 |  â  \n+ Acquisition related fair-value inventory step-up |  â |  â |  822 |  610  \n+ (Gain) Loss on sale of property, plant and equipment |  (34) |  142 |  (402) |  242  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $ 121,194 |  $ 113,430 |  $ 362,235 |  $ 325,387  \n  \nThe following table reconciles cash flow from operations to free cash flow on a trailing twelve-month basis:  \n---  \n**Trailing Twelve Months Ended**  \n_($ in thousands)_ |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \nCash flow from operating activities |  $ 339,032 |  $ 475,760  \nLess: purchases of property, plant and equipment |  (61,821) |  (63,876)  \nFree cash flow |  $ 277,211 |  $ 411,884  \n  \nThe following table reconciles operating margin to adjusted operating margin:  \n---  \n**Third Quarter Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1,2023**  \nOperating margin |  8.1 % |  8.2 % |  7.6 % |  7.6 %  \nAcquisition related fair-value inventory step-up |  â % |  â % |  â % |  â %  \nTransaction costs |  â % |  â % |  0.2 % |  â %  \nAdjusted operating margin |  8.1 % |  8.2 % |  7.8 % |  7.6 %  \n  \nThe following table reconciles net income to adjusted net income and diluted earnings per common share to adjusted diluted earnings per common share:  \n---  \n**Third Quarter Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n_($ in thousands, except per share data)_ |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \nNet income |  $ 40,866 |  $ 39,550 |  $ 123,843 |  $ 112,080  \n+ Acquisition related fair-value inventory step-up |  â |  â |  822 |  610  \n+ Transaction costs |  â |  â |  4,998 |  â  \n- Tax impact of adjustments |  â |  â |  (1,488) |  (154)  \nAdjusted net income |  $ 40,866 |  $ 39,550 |  $ 128,175 |  $ 112,536  \nDiluted earnings per common share (per above) |  $ 1.80 |  $ 1.81 |  $ 5.55 |  $ 5.09  \nTransaction costs, net of tax |  â |  â |  0.17 |  â  \nAcquisition related fair-value inventory step-up, net of tax |  â |  â |  0.03 |  0.01  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per common share |  $ 1.80 |  $ 1.81 |  $ 5.75 |  $ 5.10  \n  \nView original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/patrick-industries-inc-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-302292852.html>\n\nSOURCE Patrick Industries, Inc.\n\nReleased October 31, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/investor-news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.patrickind.com/investor-news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\nMarket Data copyright Â© 2024 [QuoteMedia](http://www.quotemedia.com \"Opens in a new window\").

I'm joined on the call today by\nAndy Nemeth, CEO; Jeff Rodino, PresidentâRV; and Andy Roeder, CFO. Kip Ellis, Presidentâ\nPowersports, Technology and Housing is also here for Q&A.\nCertain statements made in today's conference call regarding Patrick Industries and its\noperations may be considered forward-looking statements under the securities laws.\nThe company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement\nwhether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Additional factors that could\ncause the results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can\n1\nbe found in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nand the company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nI would now like to turn the call over to Andy Nemeth.\nAndy Nemeth\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today.\nOnce again, this quarter, I want to first and foremost thank our amazing team members for their\nincredible commitment, dedication, skillful execution, collaboration, and attentiveness to\nmaintaining our high level of organizational performance during this prolonged period of\nindustry-wide headwinds in each of our end markets. OEMs and dealers have maintained strict\ninventory and production discipline in response to the current demand environment. We as well,\nhave adapted our model in alignment. Our business, while not totally unaffected, continues to\nbe more resilient on a relative basis. This is the direct result of several factors included in our\nstrategic plan, including our ongoing diversification, strategic approach to M&A, and prudent cost\nmanagement, which have all played key roles. Additionally, we've demonstrated our ability to\nright size operations while simultaneously generating strong cash flows and delivering high-\nquality solutions and services to our valued customers. Throughout this process, we prioritized\nmaintaining a strong balance sheet and access to ample liquidity, which together preserves our\nability to remain nimble and flexible.\nIn the third quarter, we produced top-line growth of 6%, resulting in revenue of approximately\n$919 million and on a trailing 12-month basis, approximately $3.7 billion. Net income in the third\nquarter grew 3% to $41 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.80, including\napproximately $0.06 of dilution from our convertible notes and related warrants. Our adjusted\nEBITDA increased 7% to $121 million, while adjusted EBITDA margin was up 10 basis points to\n13.2%.\nLast quarter, we discussed three key themes for our business: the diversification and resilience\nof our model, advanced product innovation, and M&A strategy. Before Jeff and Andy dive further\ninto our end market and financial performance, I want to highlight some points of execution on\nthese themes.\nFirst, we have focused on leveraging the strength and diversification of our portfolio, not only\namong our end markets but also with our product offering. Our ability to offer a good, better,\nbest value proposition allows us to adapt to changing consumer preferences while maintaining\nour competitive edge. We have been able to maintain strong operational performance and\nresilient margins despite what continue to be challenging conditions across our end markets.\nAs we moved through the quarter and even into the past month or so, we recognize that\nconsumers remain price-conscious and interest rate sensitive. Our results this past quarter\nillustrate the success of the targeted investments we have made strategically and through our\n2\nautomation efforts to diversify our business and improve its scalability and quality over time.\nSecond, advanced product solution innovation remains a core tenet of our growth strategy, and\nenterprise-wide investments are elevating the innovation platform that exists within Patrick to\naccelerate our longer-term growth through new products and services. Our dedicated Advanced\nProduct Group is leading the way at Patrick, in partnership with our customers, to develop next-\ngeneration solutions. We have invested in and formally cultivated teams of industry experts,\nengineers, and designers in our Outdoor Enthusiast end markets that are focused on synergizing\nthe leadership at Patrick in an effort to bring new products and services to our customers over\nthe next several years. Through a combination of internal innovation, strategic acquisitions, and\na tremendous focus on customer service, we will continue to strengthen our relationship with all\nof our customers. We view these investments as strategically important and highly accretive over\nthe long term.\nIn complement with our Advanced Product Group, individual brands across Patrick continue to\ndevelop their own award-winning products and services. SeaDek was honored once again at IBEX\nthis fall for their all-new magnetic SeaDek, which employs ultra-strong magnets to form a secure\nbond on surfaces while allowing easy removal for cleaning, winterization, and maintenance.\nSeaDek continues to challenge the status quo by bringing functional, customizable, and creative\nproducts to market. Additionally, our new composite board proprietarily named NTXT is gaining\nsignificant penetration with our RV customers as they focus on more innovative, lighter-weight,\nsustainable solutions.\nAnd third, as we discussed last quarter, acquisitions remain a key component of our strategic\ngrowth plan. To that end, in the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of RecPro, which\nestablishes an aftermarket platform and foundation for us, significantly increases our exposure\nto the aftermarket, and has tremendous synergies with our Marine and Powersports brands and\nproducts. Jeff will provide further insight on some of the key synergies and opportunities from\nthis acquisition in a few minutes.\nOn the capital structure side of our business, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet\nand augmented that strength with the completion of our refinancing earlier this month,\nopportunistically improving our liquidity position and our cost of debt while extending the\nmaturity horizon on both our credit facility and our long-term debt. Our available liquidity at the\nend of the third quarter was approximately $458 million and on a pro forma basis after the\naforementioned transactions was approximately $755 million. We remain committed to a\ndisciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy with a focus on growth and strategic\nacquisitions.\nAs we head into the fourth quarter and year-end, OEMs and dealers remain intensely focused\nand disciplined as they maintain minimal inventory levels, and we anticipate reduced production\nlevels in the fourth quarter. We've aligned our business to the current run rate environment.\n3\nHowever, we also want to remain flexible, nimble, and scalable to support the expected ramp-\nup in our business when our markets turn and capitalize on that recovery.\nAt this time, even though our OEM partners are further scaling back production and focusing on\nsmaller units, we are prioritizing our ability to support our customers for the longer term by\ncommitting to investments in our team and business model during this period for that longer-\nterm outlook, which will create some short-term inefficiency and operating margin erosion in the\nfourth quarter. Additionally, we may increase our inventory levels in the fourth quarter and first\nquarter of 2025 to ensure our ability to flex and scale with our customers' needs. We are\noptimistic that tailwinds are building related to interest rates and remain confident about the\nconsumers' excitement to participate in the outdoor enthusiast space and the growing need for\naffordable housing.\nWhile recent interest rate reductions have yet to significantly impact consumer purchasing\npatterns and recent weather challenges have changed some of the priorities for their disposable\nincome, our team believes demand will start to recover as we move through 2025, and we are\nconfident in our ability to pivot and maximize our results and opportunities.\nAnd finally, I'm excited to announce that Patrick Industries will be hosting its inaugural Investor\nDay in New York on December 3rd. This event will provide an opportunity for us to share the\nlatest update on our long-term strategic vision, a more detailed outlook for 2025, and showcase\nsome of the incredible talent we have in our organization. We look forward to continuing to\nactively engage with the investment community and providing deeper insights into our business\nand growth strategy.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff, who will highlight the quarter and provide more detail on our\nend markets.\nJeff Rodino\nThanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone.\nAs Andy noted, our teams continue to perform at an exceptional level. And I, too, want to thank\nthem for the exemplary performance they have delivered in managing our business, despite\nvolatile production levels and continued aggressive efforts from OEMs and dealers to maintain\nlean channel inventory as we head into the winter. This is truly a reflection of the strength of our\nculture and our entrepreneurial spirit as well as the tremendous character of our team members.\nMoving to our end markets, our third quarter RV revenues were off 1% to $396 million versus\nthe same period in 2023, representing 43% of consolidated revenue. RV content per unit on a\nTTM basis was $4,887, off about 1% from the same period last year. However, CPU on a quarterly\nbasis is up 5% sequentially from the second quarter of 2024, driven by continued execution and\nmarket share gains. Trends continue to reflect stronger demand for smaller, entry-level units.\n4\nRV wholesale shipments increased 6% in the quarter, and we estimate total RV retail unit\nshipments decreased approximately 8% during the same period. Even with the increase in\nwholesale production during the quarter, our estimates suggest dealers have destocked an\nadditional approximate 19,800 units during the quarter, resulting in an estimated 16 to 18 weeks-\non-hand versus the historical average of 26 to 30 weeks, and further down from the first and\nsecond quarters of 2024. With weeks-on-hand being significantly lower than historical levels, we\nremain optimistic that dealers will continue to restock inventory ahead of spring selling season\nto avoid having too little inventory to meet customer demand and to support the expected\ninflection in retail when the economic environment supports it.\nOur third quarter Marine revenues were $136 million, off 21% from the prior year, representing\n15% of consolidated sales. Our estimated Marine content per wholesale unit on a TTM basis was\n$3,936, down 6% from the same period last year. However, on a quarterly basis, sequentially\nfrom the second quarter of 2024, estimated content per unit was up 3% year-over-year and 7%\nsequentially.\nAs we've discussed, we are more heavily indexed towards higher-engineered ski and wake and\npontoon categories, where we estimate production levels were down approximately 41% and\n29%, respectively, in the third quarter, and approximately 52% and 35%, respectively, year-to-\ndate. As a reminder, prior to the first quarter, we reported Powersports revenue in our Marine\nmarket and have restated our content-per-unit numbers and the current and prior year's figures\nto reflect these adjustments. For modeling purposes, you can find our 2023 revenues by end\nmarket in our earnings slide deck.\nWe estimate in the quarter, retail and wholesale powerboat unit shipments were 45,000 and\n31,900 units, respectively. This implies a dealer field inventory reduction of approximately 13,000\nunits, leading to our estimate that weeks-on-hand dropped to 19 to 21 weeks at the end of the\nquarter, well below the historical average of 36 to 40 weeks and further down from the first and\nsecond quarters of 2024. As noted, we anticipate that dealers will continue to remain cautious\non adding additional inventory during the slower seasonal period and believe these challenges\nmay be magnified in the near term by recent storms in the south.\nOur Powersports revenues were $87 million in the quarter, representing 10% of our third quarter\n2024 consolidated sales. Our Powersports business is primarily centered around side-by-side, golf\ncart, and motorcycle sectors of the industry with the emphasis on the utility segment of the side-\nby-side market. Similarly to the last quarter, utility remained resilient when compared to the\nrecreational side and our Powersports business delivered upon our expectations. We are\nbeginning to see the softening related to OEM production levels in the utility side in the fourth\nquarter, primarily as a result of OEMs aggressively focusing on keeping inventory levels lean in\nthis segment of the market, and we expect this to continue in the first half of 2025. We anticipate\nOEMs and dealers will continue to collaborate in an effort to maintain appropriate dealer\ninventory levels.\n5\nOn the Housing side of our business, better-than-expected demand for affordable housing in the\nthird quarter had a positive impact on revenue and the ability to generate cash flow. For the\nquarter, our Housing revenue was up 13% to $300 million, representing 32% of consolidated\nsales. In Manufactured Housing, which represented approximately 59% of Housing revenues in\nthe quarter, our estimated content per unit on a TTM basis increased 1% year-over-year to\n$6,518 and was up 1% sequentially.\nGiven the most recent rate cuts, we expect the consumer purchasing power and availability of\nhomes will improve as we move into and through next year. MH shipments increased an\nestimated 17% in the quarter, while total housing starts declined 3%, with single-family housing\ndown slightly and multi-family down 11%. Single-family housing represented approximately 73%\nof total new housing starts in the quarter.\nFinally, as Andy mentioned briefly, we closed on the acquisition of the direct-to-consumer\naftermarket-based RecPro in September. This acquisition is a prime example of our strategy to\nacquire leading brands with unique yet complementary products, services and processes that can\nbe used to generate additional opportunities across our business units and for our valued\ncustomers. With RecPro, we see three exciting opportunities: first, RecPro has and will continue\nto grow its consumer-focused brand and portfolio of private label and independently branded\ndirect-to-consumer products. Second, we are excited to introduce the RecPro brand name and\nproducts to our OEM customers as an alternative to current products in the space. And finally,\nwe have the opportunity to sell our legacy portfolio of manufactured and aftermarket products\nacross end markets through a more effective, well-known, and efficient distribution platform.\nTogether, in collaboration with RecPro's incredible team, we plan to expand and enhance the\naccessibility of aftermarket components at Patrick and see significant runway and continued\ngrowth potential to this channel as a result.\nI will now turn the call over to Andy Roeder, who will provide additional comments on our\nfinancial performance.\nAndy Roeder\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everybody.\nMoving to our financial results.\nOur consolidated third quarter net sales increased 6% to $919 million, driven by 13% growth in\nHousing revenue, coupled with increased sales from the acquisition of Sportech earlier this year.\nTogether, these factors more than offset the 21% decline in Marine revenue and a 1% decline in\nRV revenue during the period. Gross profit increased 7% to $213 million and gross margin was\n23.1%, up 10 basis points from the same period last year.\nSG&A expenses increased $5 million, or 7%, to $76 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily\ndue to acquisitions that closed in the past year. Amortization expense increased approximately\n6\n$5 million, or 25% year-over-year, also as a result of acquisitions. Total operating expenses\nincreased $10 million, or 8%, to $138 million.\nOperating income grew $3 million, or 5%, to $74 million, while operating margin declined slightly\nby 10 basis points to 8.1%. These figures reflect our focus on maintaining a high level of service\nfor our valued customers, higher amortization, as noted earlier, and lower revenue from our\nMarine businesses, which tend to be higher margin with a higher fixed cost profile.\nNet income increased 3% to $41 million, or $1.80 per diluted share. As Andy noted, our diluted\nEPS for the third quarter of 2024 includes approximately $0.06 per share in additional accounting-\nrelated dilution from our 2028 convertible notes and related warrants as a result of the increase\nin our stock price above the convertible option strike price. As we've noted in the past, we have\nhedges in place, which are expected to reduce or eliminate any potential dilution to the\ncompany's common stock upon any conversion of the convertible notes and/or offset any cash\npayments the company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted\nnotes. For reporting purposes, these hedges are always anti-dilutive and therefore, cannot be\nincluded when reporting earnings per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 7% to $121 million versus $113 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin\nexpanded 10 basis points to 13.2% for the third quarter of 2024.\nOur overall effective tax rate was 24.8% for the third quarter, compared to 27% in the prior year.\nWe expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26% for the fourth quarter.\nCash provided by operations for the first 9 months of 2024 was approximately $224 million.\nThis quarter, purchases of property, plant, and equipment were $18 million. We continue to\nprioritize our investment in innovation and automation to create long-term value for customers\nand stakeholders. We estimate our 2024 capital expenditures will total $70 million to $75 million.\nOur balance sheet remains solid. At the end of the quarter and including our acquisition of\nRecPro, our net leverage was 2.6x, clearly in alignment with our plan to de-lever following the\nSportech acquisition to a planned target range of 2.25 to 2.5x.\nTotal net liquidity at the end of the third quarter was $458 million; comprised of $53 million of\ncash on hand and unused capacity on our revolving credit facility of $405 million. Our goal is to\nremain balanced in our capital allocation strategy. We are also opportunistic with a specific focus\non margin accretive acquisitions that complement our existing businesses and enhance our\npresence in our end markets. As we evaluate strategic growth initiatives, we will continue to\nbalance these with reinvesting in our business and returning cash to shareholders.\nAs Andy mentioned, in October, we proactively issued $500 million of 6.375% senior notes due\n2032 and plan to redeem $300 million of 7.5% senior notes due 2027 on November 7, 2024. We\n7\nalso amended and restated our revolving credit facility with more favorable terms, increasing the\nsize to $1 billion and extending the maturity out from 2027 to 2029. These actions have\npositioned us with an additional $300 million in liquidity, will reduce our annualized interest\nexpense, and extend the maturity of an already strong credit facility. We continue to have the\nbalance sheet strength, flexibility, and liquidity to remain on offense with the ability to seize\nprofitable and meaningful strategic growth opportunities as they arise.\nWe returned $12 million to shareholders in the form of dividends during the quarter. We did not\nrepurchase any shares during the quarter. However, we will remain opportunistic on future share\nrepurchases, and $78 million left authorized under our current plan at the end of the third\nquarter. As Andy noted earlier, we are prioritizing strategic opportunities while focusing on\nmaintaining a manageable leverage ratio.\nMoving to our end market outlook. As we noted last quarter, OEMs and dealers alike remain\nextremely disciplined, and we continue to expect RV and marine dealers to focus on maintaining\nminimal inventory levels through the end of the year and expect the powersports OEMs to reduce\ndealer inventories through the end of the year. We believe an improvement in consumer\nconfidence and interest rates are key factors that should meaningfully improve dealers' desire to\nbring on inventory beyond the minimum level and anticipate seeing this inflection in 2025.\nWe now estimate full-year RV wholesale unit shipments will be towards the low end of our\npreviously expected range of 320,000 to 330,000 units and continue to estimate 2024 RV retail\nunit shipments will be down approximately 8% to 10%, implying roughly 340,000 to 350,000\nunits.\nIn Marine, similar to RV, our wholesale outlook is more conservative as we now expect 2024\nindustry wholesale unit shipments for our overall product mix to be down 25% to 30%. We\ncontinue to expect full-year industry retail unit shipments to be down approximately 8% to 10%.\nIn our Powersports end market, given the recent commentary from OEMs in the space that they\nare acutely focusing on reducing dealer inventory, we now estimate Powersports unit shipments\nwill be lower than we originally forecast and expect our Powersports revenue to decline 10% to\n20% sequentially from the third quarter.\nIn our Housing market, we estimate MH wholesale unit shipments will be up 15% for 2024. And\non the residential housing side of the market, we estimate 2024 total new site-built housing starts\nwill be flat versus 2023.\nThe changes in our end market forecast, assuming current content per unit for each end market\nand factoring in a more positive MH outlook imply a revenue reduction of approximately $60\nmillion to $70 million versus our prior outlook. Including the RecPro acquisition, we expect the\ndecline to be approximately $50 million to $60 million. As Andy noted, while we have rightsized\nour business to the current run rates, we are not implementing additional cost reduction efforts\n8\nin the fourth quarter, as we are focused on ensuring the integrity of our business model and\ntalent profile to support our anticipated scalability needs in alignment with longer-term OEM\nneeds and demands, and in alignment with our strategic initiatives and customer service-related\nfocus. This will cause some operating margin dilution in the fourth quarter as OEMs scale back\nproduction levels even further, especially when compared to the historical restocking\nopportunity we typically see in our markets in Q4 in anticipation of the upcoming selling season.\nWe have a playbook to further scale back our cost profile, and we'll execute if needed for the\nlong term if we do not see an improvement in our markets. As a result, we now expect operating\nmargin to be down 20 to 30 basis points on an adjusted basis for the full year versus 2023 to 7.2%\nto 7.3%.\nWe estimate our full year operating cash flow will be $370 million to $390 million, implying free\ncash flow of $295 million or more based on our CAPEX estimates. As Andy also noted, we may\nintentionally add some raw material inventory during the fourth quarter to ensure flexibility and\nscalability with our OEM partners' potential needs in 2025.\nFor 2025, we plan to lay out our detailed outlook for our end markets and margins at our\nupcoming Investor Day in December and look forward to sharing more soon. For now, we'd like\nto give you some high-level thoughts on how we are currently anticipating our end markets\nperforming next year. We are optimistic that an inflection will come in 2025 and believe\nconsumer confidence will improve following the election given still low unemployment, solid\neconomic growth, and a more favorable interest rate outlook with lower inflation. Based on these\nexpectations, we estimate RV retail will be flat next year, which on an expected one-for-one\nreplenishment model will drive improvement in wholesale shipments as dealers keep weeks-on-\nhand unchanged. For Marine, we expect retail to be flat year-over-year with improvement not\nbeginning until the second half, and estimate wholesale will be up 5% to 10%, still implying a less\nthan one-for-one replenishment model. For Powersports, we expect shipments to be down 10%.\nIn our Housing business, we expect MH shipments to increase 5% to 10% and single-family starts\nto be flat to up 5% next year. Based on these estimates, we would expect our operating margin\nin 2025 to improve meaningfully and more than the top end of our typical 30 to 50-basis point\nrange to an estimated 70 to 90 basis points.\nThat completes my remarks.

One moment, please while we poll for questions.\nAnd the first question comes from the line of Scott Stember with ROTH MKM. Please proceed.\n9\nScott Stember\nHey, guys. And thanks for taking my questions.\nAndy Nemeth\nGood morning.\nJeff Rodino\nGood morning.\nScott Stember\nYou guys gave an update for the fourth quarter on Powersports, I guess, the sequential decline\nthat you're expecting to see. Can you maybe talk about what you're expecting to see in some of\nthe other markets such as RV and Marine, given the incremental shutdowns that you're\nexpecting?\nAndy Nemeth\nScott, this is Andy. When I think about kind of just overall Outdoor Enthusiasts, discipline as it\nrelates to inventory is really the common theme that we're seeing today. And the OEMs have\nbeen incredibly thoughtful about the way they're thinking about inventories-on-hand. As we\nnoted from a weeks-on-hand perspective, inventories continue to decline in both RV and Marine.\nAnd we think the same is happening in Powersports, especially on the utility side of the business.\nWe think the OEMs are being proactive in ensuring that they keep their inventories in check. And\nso as we look at kind of Q4 here, our expectation is that OEMs are going to continue to be\ndisciplined. They're going to continue to be thoughtful. We're seeing some reduced production\nlevels in Q4 here, but all in alignment with maintaining extremely, let's just call it, opportunistic\ninventory levels that are going to need to flex back up when we do see an inflection in retail. So\noverall, just in general, in Outdoor Enthusiast, what we'd tell you is incredible inventory discipline\nand thoughtfulness on OEM production levels, which, again, we think is going to lead to a restock.\nScott Stember\nGot it. And then last question before I get back in the queue. Just taking a step back after the\nRecPro acquisition, can you maybe talk about how you guys are positioned from an aftermarket\nstandpoint? How much, or what percentage of your total sales? And what kind of a cushion could\nthis provide you if things were to remain soft into the first half of next year?\nAndy Nemeth\nSure. I'll talk a little bit about RecPro, and then I'll let Jeff add some additional color on it. But I\nwould just tell you that RecPro is extremely exciting from our perspective as it relates to a real\ntrue aftermarket platform for our business and as we are kind of looking across our Outdoor\nEnthusiast product lines and brands today, we are extremely excited about the potential to\nleverage that RecPro aftermarket platform and really demonstrate some organic growth amongst\nour existing product categories and really kind of flow that through as it relates to our ability to\ntouch the aftermarket on a direct-to-consumer basis. So RecPro for us is a foundation. It's kind\n10\nof the one we've been looking for as it relates to size and scale, and it's performing better from\nour perspective as it relates to the outlook we have. We're very excited about what we see. So\nJeff, I don't know if you want to add any additional color?\nJeff Rodino\nJust I would add that in the first month and a half, we have seen our teams really adapt on to\nwhat RecPro's model is and really get very active in working with the team over at RecPro to look\nat how they're approaching the aftermarket, how RecPro can help them further their approach\ninto the aftermarket. And we're starting to get some traction along the lines of showing some of\nthe RecPro products into our other spaces. So, it's really exciting that I talked about kind of the\nthree-pronged or three opportunities within the prepared remarks, and we're really active in all\nthree of those areas really almost immediately. So, it's really exciting to see.\nScott Stember\nGot it. Thatâs all I have for now. Thank you.\nAndy Nemeth\nThanks.\nOperator\nAnd the next question will come from the line of Mike Swartz with Truist Securities. Please\nproceed.\nMichael Swartz\nHey, guys. Good morning. Just maybe to start housekeeping. Just in terms of the 6% revenue\ngrowth in the quarter, could you give us just a sense of the M&A contribution versus pricing\nversus the organic share?\nAndy Roeder\nSure, Mike. This is Andy Roeder. Yeah, M&A acquisitions drove that growth. Acquisitions were\nup 9% for the quarter year-over-year. Industry was down 4%., that includes mix, and organic was\nup 1% with pricing down 2% and content share up 3%.\nMichael Swartz\nOkay. Perfect. That's super-helpful. And as we talk about the lowering the full-year outlook for\noperating margins, I would assume most of that is coming from the reduced outlooks in Marine\nand Powersports. But was there any impact from the RecPro acquisition? I know it's, as you've\nsaid, margin-accretive, but was there incremental D&A associated with that that's material?\nAndy Nemeth\nSure, Mike, it's Andy Nemeth. Two things. One, it is -- our operating margin erosion in Q4 that\nwe're talking about today is purely related to the industry declines or at least the production\nlevels being pulled back in Marine and Powersports, as you noted. RecPro is at its seasonally low,\n11\nif you will, in the aftermarket side of the business in Q4. And so Q1, Q2, we start to see things\nreally pick up, Q2 being the strongest as it relates to the aftermarket platform.\nSo, it's kind of the seasonal low for RecPro, but we are still seeing, again, everything according to\nplan as it relates to RecPro. There's some SG&A acquisition related that's driving through and as\nwell as the amortization is flowing through at the OpEx line. So, we don't expect any gross margin\nerosion. What we really -- this is really kind of at the operating level amongst acquisitions and\namortization impacting margins in the fourth quarter.\nMichael Swartz\nGot you. That's helpful. And then just a final one for me. As we look at the RV content in the\nquarter, I know you guys talked about it on a TTM and it was kind of similar rate of decline year-\nover-year as we saw in the second quarter. But the implied content intra-quarter would have\nbeen down about 7% year-over-year, and I think it was up 9% in the second. So, I guess, help me\nbridge the change there. Is that all due to kind of incrementally negative production mix, or is\nthere anything else kind of driving that quarter-over-quarter change?\nJeff Rodino\nYeah, Mike, this is Jeff. Since the beginning of the year we've seen kind of the shift in the overall\nRV market, about 5% shift into travel trailers. And amongst that shift, we've seen, as I mentioned\nand noted in the remarks, the trend towards smaller, more entry-level units, and we've seen a\nlot of that occur, and we continue to see that trend in the third quarter and really more so even\ninto the fourth quarter. So that is, you know, we're not losing any content per se, just the smaller\nunits drive a smaller number on that number.\nMichael Swartz\nOkay, great. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed.\nDan Moore\nYes, thank you for all the color. Again, just going back to the RV side, obviously, I understand\ndealers holding tightly onto inventories through the remainder of the year and really kind of\nhistoric lows. So just curious about the outlook for next year. If retail is indeed flat, it sounds like\nyou're not necessarily anticipating any type of restock in the initial outlook for 2025. And\nwondering how much conservatism is in that type of forecast? Just curious why we wouldn't see\na little bit more of a restock if indeed we do kind of flatten out on retail.\nAndy Nemeth\nSure, Dan. This is Andy Nemeth. As we look at the RV industry and the balance in the inventory\ntoday, we're assuming similar weeks-on-hand to what we have today for next year in this model.\nSo, what I would tell you is we do believe that there's a need for restock. We're being thoughtful\n12\nand cautious about how we're thinking about our business model and plan and forecast right\nnow.\nBut I will tell you as well, that there's been points in time during this year where we've seen\nincremental upticks in demand from the dealers to the OEMs based on inflection points, if you\nwill, small inflection points of retail at the dealer lots. And so, we've seen that through our\ntransport businesses. And so, we do feel pretty confident that a restock will be needed. But at\nthat point -- at this point in time, we're just being thoughtful and cautious about where we're at,\nholding weeks on hand, assuming that we'll be able to inflect when the conditions change.\nDan Moore\nCertainly, makes sense. And then just looking at the balance sheet, obviously, the opportunistic\nfinancing. As you noted, you have over $700 million of liquidity. As you continue to grow,\napproaching $4 billion in revenue and expand end markets, are you seeing larger potential\nopportunities on the M&A front?\nAndy Nemeth\nI think that we absolutely are seeing larger deal potential and deals out there. We certainly are\nattracted to both smaller and larger deals, but the excitement that we have today certainly is in\nthe depth and breadth of the pipeline that we continue to organically cultivate and look at. So,\nto answer your question in short order, yes, we are seeing larger deals out there that we\ndefinitely are taking a look at as well as some of the smaller deals. So, we're not throwing away\nthe smaller deals. We certainly are excited about some of the entrepreneurial businesses that\nare out there. But again, we do look and feel like we've got an appetite for larger deals.\nDan Moore\nAnd I'll sneak one more. In Powersports, I think you said that the expectation is for shipments to\nbe down about 10% next year. Obviously, the thesis is around Sportech is in content growth. So\njust maybe talk about Patrick's potential to outpace the end market in 2025, but more\nimportantly, on a go-forward basis, given the content opportunities that you're seeing. Thanks\nagain.\nKip Ellis\nHey. Good morning, Dan. Powersports on a broad basis, we projected roughly 10% off. That's a\ncombination of on- and off-road product. We are, as you're well aware, skewed more to the UTV\nside and the premium element of that. And we're emboldened by the continued cab attachment\nrates. We're continuing to see increases in that regard as HVAC is instituted in these models, both\nthe 3-Pass and the 6-Pass units. And so we continue to see -- we've estimated low- to mid-single-\ndigit growth organically within that. And we're also encouraged by some of the notes have been\nput out there about the relative resilience of the ultimate -- or the UTV ultimately equipped the\npremium product within that space being more resilient with low single-digit retail pullback.\n13\nSo as Andy alluded, we recognize some diligence and some proactive inventory pruning. We feel\nwe're positioned to be in the segments of the market that have been least impacted from a cycle\nstandpoint. And so the R&D pipeline for these businesses remains full. And so as we look at\ncontinued attachment rate growth and we look at the broad portfolio of customers that we work\nwith and their interest in working with us on these components, we're excited about how that\nprojects. But on a broad basis for Powersports, specifically side-by-side, the chassis themselves,\nwe're plugging an estimated 10% pullback for next year, but our mix and organic growth would\ncertainly be an offset in part to that.\nDan Moore\nVery helpful. Thanks again.\nAndy Nemeth\nThank you.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Noah Zatzkin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please\nproceed.\nNoah Zatzkin\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just one on RV. In terms of kind of industry mix shifting\ntowards kind of lower-end travel trailers and some of the kind of shortening of units and I won't\ncall it de-contenting, but maybe de-contenting that's gone on, where do you think we are looking\nout into 2025? Do you think that dynamic has kind of stabilized, or do you think there's kind of\nmore pressure from mix that will continue next year? Thanks.\nAndy Nemeth\nYeah, Noah, we feel like -- so the mix hasn't -- has changed this year. It hasn't necessarily changed\nin the last quarter. So we've seen this mix of smaller units, and it's continued to be a mix towards\nsmaller units. What we typically see in cycles as we see a return of consumer interest and\nconfidence and we see kind of rates coming back down, we see the opportunity for the consumer\nto -- who have bought these smaller units to upgrade. And so if you were to ask us where we\nthink we're at, we expect to see these small units for a short period of time until such point when\nthat consumer confidence inflexes. And then at that point in time, we would expect to see a mix\nshift back towards the larger units.\nI think one of the things and themes that we feel really good about is the tremendous efforts that\nour team has put in to ensure our content levels while the mix has been changing. So, our content\nnumbers have stayed resilient and strong because we've been picking up business despite the\nfact that the units are smaller and there is less content going in. We haven't lost business, and\nour team has been gaining business. So again, the resilience of the content numbers in alignment\nwith what we're seeing as it relates to smaller units gives us confidence. And especially when we\nsee the units inflect back up, we would expect those content numbers to go up.\n14\nNoah Zatzkin\nReally helpful. Maybe just one more on RecPro. In terms of like your ability kind of in terms of\nspeed to market, in terms of getting your brands on the RecPro platform and then beginning to\nmarket RecPro products even to OEMs, like is that a synergy dynamic that should benefit next\nyear, or is it more kind of a '26 dynamic? Or just any color in terms of kind of speed to augmenting\nand benefiting that business. Thanks.\nJeff Rodino\nYes, this is Jeff. As I mentioned earlier, the action items that we put in place have already started\nto happen. We're starting to see products. We're working through the introduction of products\nonto their site. We're working through the introduction of their products to the OEMs. And\nthey're continuing to grow their business organically.\nI think Andy mentioned a few minutes ago that we're kind of in a little bit of a seasonal low with\nregards to the aftermarket piece and really what we expected out of RecPro, which honestly gives\nus a lot of time and their team time to really focus on launching those products. So you'll start to\nsee those products come on board latter part of this year and into the first quarter of next year.\nSo we will see some impact in 2025 for sure.\nAndy Nemeth\nYeah, I would characterize it, Noah, as there's more opportunity than we thought amongst our\nexisting product categories. And the to-do list as it relates to the prioritization of products going\non to that platform continues to grow above and beyond our expectations. So we expect\nimmediate traction into 2025 as we execute on RecPro.\nNoah Zatzkin\nThank you.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Joseph Altobello with Raymond James. Please\nproceed.\nMartin Mitela\nGood morning. This is actually Martin on for Joe. Just wondering if you can speak to the decline\nin Marine content per unit and just kind of what needs to be done to show some growth there\nagain?\nAndy Nemeth\nSure. That's primarily mix-related. When we think about content, we've got a number of new\nproducts. I think we've talked about this before as well. But even as we look across our spectrum,\nnot only in alignment with our Advanced Product Group, which is really looking at solutionizing\nup our portfolio, but when we look at all the innovations and product development and\n15\nprototyping that's happened over the last 12 months, it's just been significant. And so we're very\noptimistic about the traction that we're going to be able to gain organically.\nBut as it relates to just content on the marine side, it's really been related to the mix, and we are\nheavier skewed towards the higher engineered product lines, ski and wake, as we note, and as\nwell on the pontoon side of the business. And those OEM shipment levels are greater than kind\nof the overall industry shipment levels as it relates to the reduction that we've seen. So that's the\nprimary reason on the Marine side of the business. But we are picking up business as well on that\nside. And so we do feel kind of similar to what we feel in RV. We see a little bit of a mix shift, we\nsee production rates kind of inflect, we do expect to pick up content on the back end of this.\nMartin\nGreat. Thank you. Thatâs it for me.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed.\nCraig Kennison\nHey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate the extra color on 2025 as well.\nAnd maybe we can start there. I think, Andy, you talked about getting 70 to 90 basis points of\nimprovement, but that's versus your revised 2025 outlook. So you're looking at something close\nto 8% EBIT margin. Is that math correct?\nAndy Roeder\nYeah, Craig, you're thinking correct there.\nCraig Kennison\nOkay. And then just regarding 2025, you've changed the balance sheet a little bit. I want to make\nsure we have the right assumption for your interest expense forecast and even share count\nbecause I know there's been a lot of noise in that as well.\nAndy Roeder\nYeah. I mean, in regard to our refinance, it was just an opportunity to reduce our interest\nexpense, push out maturities, gain some liquidity to keep us on offense. But in terms of our\ninterest rate, we redeemed our 7.5% notes with 6.375%. So that's going to save us about $4\nmillion. In terms of overall debt, that really didn't change. We just used the proceeds to pay down\ndebt on our revolver, and as I noted, those $300 million high yields.\nAndy Nemeth\nCraig, if you look at where we're at right now, we're running about $80 million of total interest\nexpense for the year, and we do expect some savings on that in the tune of $2 million to $3\nmillion on an overall basis. So I'm going to say $78 million to $80 million if you just assume\nnormalized run rates with where we've been as it relates to interest expense. And then as it\n16\nrelates to share count, the dilution -- the increase in our stock price has driven this accounting\nadjustment for dilution. And right now, if you look at kind of where we're at for the quarter, we're\n22.6 million shares outstanding. I would say 23 million right now is a reasonable estimate to use\nfor the share count for 2025.\nCraig Kennison\nThank you both for that. And then I guess just regarding, Andy, your hope for an inflection next\nyear, is there an interest rate outlook embedded in that optimism?\nAndy Nemeth\nYeah. We think the initial interest rate reduction is not enough to really drive the inflection point.\nSo yeah, we do think that we need a couple more rate reductions to kind of instill things. I think\nas we noted, we would expect just some relief after the election coming up here in anticipation\nof a rate adjustment or two into the next year. We're hearing from kind of players in the space.\nIt certainly is a tailwind versus a headwind. And so I'm not saying we're banking on significant\nrate reductions, but I do believe that consumer confidence will improve. And we do feel like\nthere's another one or two rate reductions coming built into our assumptions at this point. So\nwe're being thoughtful about it. We're not saying there aren't going to be any. We would say two\nto three more rate reductions would be built into our model going forward from this point on, so\nincluding what we see in Q4 here.\nCraig Kennison\nGreat. Thank you.\nAndy Nemeth\nThank you.\nAndy Roeder\nThanks.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Tristan Thomas-Martin with BMO Capital Markets.\nPlease proceed.\nTristan Thomas-Martin\nGood morning. With kind of this -- at some point, there's going to be a content up-cycle, right?\nI'm just kind of wondering, are OEMs going to have enough information when they're planning\nfor model year '26 is to be confident to up-cycle and kind of add content, or is that really more\nof a model year '27 event?\nAndy Nemeth\nI think that they will move very, very quickly to add content. The OEMs, especially in the RV space,\nare extremely scalable and have the ability to move production lines and units and models. And\n17\nso we would see a very, very quick inflection. And I think that's one of the things that we get\nexcited about as it relates to our position in the marketplace is the ability to make sure that we're\npositioned to scale with them.\nSo again, I think that it's a very quick reaction to what they will feel. And they've done equally on\nthe other side of the business. As we watch kind of smaller units come into play, they've shifted\nvery, very quickly. So they are extremely versatile and agile, and we would expect them to shift\nvery quickly with content versus a model year kind of movement towards larger units. They can\nmake those shifts on the fly.\nTristan Thomas-Martin\nOkay. Thank you. And then just, I believe you mentioned RecPro's kind of own branded products.\nJust out of curiosity, where are they strongest? Thanks.\nJeff Rodino\nSo on the aftermarket side, they're very strong on their air conditioner units, furniture, they play\npretty well in the awnings space on aftermarket, and different plumbing and electrical items for\nsure. But really, they've got a really broad base of products, which allows consumers to come to\na website where it's not just one product or -- one product here or there. They've got such a\nbroad array that it gives consumers a great opportunity to get more than just one part when they\ngo to their website. But certainly from the strongest, I would say, furniture, they do a lot of\nreplacement furniture, a lot of replacement air conditioners and awnings and some of those type\nitems.\nTristan Thomas-Martin\nThank you.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Alex Perry with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nAlex Perry\nHi. I just wanted to ask on sort of the expectation for the shaping of the operating margin next\nyear. Are you sort of expecting continued pressure in the first half given the volume de-leverage\nwith sort of an anticipated rebound in the second half? Thanks.\nAndy Nemeth\nIn general, overall, what I'd say is our model reflects kind of second half strength versus first half.\nThat being said, the RV industry has been in this cycle for longer than the other two have. And\nthey're really -- the inventory levels are where we're very optimistic in seeing the lean level of\ninventory that's out in the channel.\nSo we could see some improvement prior to that from our perspective, at least as we're looking\nat it in the RV space. Right now, Powersports and Marine, we're expecting kind of second half. In\n18\nHousing, on the MH side, we expect kind of consistent strength really throughout the year. So\nitâs a little bit of a mixed model. In general, yes, second half versus first half, but I think we could\nsee some strength on the RV side of the business prior to that.\nAlex Perry\nReally helpful. And then just a follow-up on the Powersports shipments down 10% next year. Any\ncolor on sort of the shaping of that? I would presume itâs following the trend with RV and Marine,\nmore pressure in the first half compared to the second half.\nKip Ellis\nYeah. Good morning. This is Kip. Thereâs been certainly print regarding the OEMâs interest in\ncutting inventory, particularly with a focus here in this fourth quarter. And so we recognize that,\nand weâre seeing that in the order demand. In Q4, thereâs some anticipation, and I think itâs a\nproactive position that weâre recognizing across the market to really work with their dealers to\nlean that inventory out. So we could see some of that carrying over in the early part of next year.\nAgain, with our balance being skewed more towards the more resilient premium products, and\nthatâs both in the utility side and the sport and rec side, we're not seeing the retail pullback in\nthat area being as significant as some of the more value line or baseline products that are in the\nmarket and so, circling back to your question specifically, yes, it's certainly, we're optimistic about\nthe second half of next year and the opportunity for a pivot in the market given the inventory\ncontrols that they're going to put in place and lean things out. So with low-single-digits to flat\nperformance from a utility premium product from a retail standpoint, we don't anticipate a lot\nof inventory to cut, but we recognize they want to be proactive in working with dealers and\ncertainly support that going forward. So kind of the second half, maybe mid-Q2 type thing where\nwe see some opportunity for a pivot.\nAlex Perry\nPerfect. Thatâs really helpful. Best of luck going forward.\nAndy Nemeth\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the\ncall back to Andy Nemeth for closing remarks.\nAndy Nemeth\nThank you, everybody. Once again, I just want to acknowledge and thank our incredible team\nmembers and leaders across the organization and across our brand platform for tremendous\ncommitment, passion, and dedication to this organization. I can't stress enough how strong this\nteam is, the culture that we have in place, and how confident we are in their ability to execute\nand so just tremendous appreciation for them.\n19\nAdditionally, I kind of think as we look out at the markets and where we're headed, I think we\nfeel like we're in a great position to flex. We feel like we're really in a position to be scalable when\nour OEMs need it. And the opportunities that are in front of us today allow us in a position to\nstay on offense.\nAnd finally, again, I just want to let you know that we look forward to seeing everybody, our\ninstitutional investors, analysts at our upcoming Investor Day in December. We look forward to\nsharing some more information about what we see in '25. And again, just in alignment with the\nteam message and reflecting some of the strength of the team, introduce you to some of our\nteam members and demonstrate kind of who we are as an organization. So thank you, again.\nThank you for joining us on the call and look forward to talking to you soon.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Diluted earnings per share of $1.80 included the dilutive\nimpact of our convertible notes and related warrants in the period, or an estimated $0.06 per share.\nFor the first nine months of 2024, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $5.75.\nâ¢ Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $121 million; adjusted EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to\n13.2%.\nâ¢ Cash flow provided by operating activities was $224 million for the first nine months of the year\ncompared to $294 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow, on a trailing twelve-month\nbasis, was $277 million.\nâ¢ Completed the acquisition of RecPro, which significantly increases our penetration into the RV\naftermarket, while also providing synergy opportunity for our Marine and Powersports end markets to\nsell through a more advanced aftermarket distribution channel.\nâ¢ Maintained solid balance sheet and liquidity position, ending the third quarter with a total net leverage\nratio of 2.6x following the acquisition of RecPro and liquidity of $458 million.\nâ¢ Subsequent to quarter end, the Company amended and extended the maturity of its credit facility, and\nalso issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2032.

(NASDAQ: PATK) (\"Patrick\" or the \"Company\"), a\nleading component solutions provider for the Outdoor Enthusiast and Housing markets, today reported\nfinancial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 29, 2024.\nNet sales increased 6% to $919 million, an increase of $53 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The\ngrowth in net sales was due to a 13% increase in Housing revenue coupled with revenue gains from our\nSportech acquisition, which closed in January of this year. These factors more than offset a 21% decline in\nMarine revenue as marine OEMs as well as OEMs across our other Outdoor Enthusiast markets continued to\nmaintain highly disciplined production schedules in an effort to manage dealer inventory in alignment with\ncurrent end market demand.\nOperating income of $74 million in the third quarter of 2024 increased $3 million, or 5%, compared to $71\nmillion in the third quarter of 2023. Operating margin of 8.1% decreased 10 basis points compared to 8.2% in\nthe same period a year ago, reflecting higher SG&A expenses and amortization costs related to acquisitions.\nFor the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, excluding acquisition transaction\ncosts and purchase accounting adjustments in both periods, adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis\npoints to 7.8%.\nNet income increased 3% to $41 million, compared to $40 million in the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings\nper share of $1.80 in the third quarter of 2024 included approximately $0.06 of dilution from our convertible\nnotes and related warrants. There was no dilutive impact from the convertible notes in the third quarter of\n2023. For the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, excluding acquisition\ntransaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments in both periods, adjusted net income increased 14%\nto $128 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $5.75. Diluted earnings per share\nfor the first nine months of 2024 included approximately $0.10 of dilution from our 2028 convertible notes and\n1\nrelated warrants. The prior year period included approximately $0.05 of dilution related to our 1.00%\nConvertible Senior Notes due 2023, which were repaid in cash in February 2023.\n\"The Patrick team delivered another quarter of solid results with revenue and net income growth supported by\nthe continued diversification of our business,\" said Andy Nemeth, Chief Executive Officer. \"The resilience of\nour model is directly related to the dedication and talent of our incredible team members, and the strategic\ninvestments we have made enabling Patrick to perform well during a prolonged period of inventory destocking\nthat has continued to affect our Outdoor Enthusiast end markets at different times over the last two years.\"\nJeff Rodino, President â RV, said, \"This quarter, we welcomed RecPro into our family of brands, which\nmeaningfully expands our position in the direct-to-consumer RV and enthusiast aftermarket. We are\nenergized by the depth and breadth of their product offering, the synergies across our business, and their\ntremendous leadership and expertise in e-commerce and aftermarket sales. We believe RecPro's efficient\ndistribution channel and significant consumer reach will substantially enhance our ability to provide Patrick's\nvaluable aftermarket solutions across all of our end markets.\"\nThird Quarter 2024 Revenue by Market Sector\n(compared to Third Quarter 2023 unless otherwise noted)\nRV (43% of Revenue)\nâ¢ Revenue of $396 million decreased 1% while wholesale RV industry unit shipments increased\n6%.\nâ¢ Content per wholesale RV unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) decreased by 1% to $4,887.\nCompared to the second quarter of 2024, content per wholesale RV unit (on a trailing twelve-\nmonth basis) decreased 2%.\nMarine (15% of Revenue)\nâ¢ Revenue of $136 million decreased 21% while estimated wholesale powerboat industry unit\nshipments decreased 23%. Our Marine end market revenue previously included Powersports\nrevenue, which we began to report separately following the Sportech acquisition. End market\nrevenue and content per unit reflect this change for the relevant periods.\nâ¢ Estimated content per wholesale powerboat unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) decreased 6%\nto $3,936. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, estimated content per wholesale powerboat\nunit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) was flat.\nPowersports (10% of Revenue)\nâ¢ Revenue of $87 million increased 204%, driven primarily by the acquisition of Sportech in the first\nquarter of 2024.\nHousing (32% of Revenue, comprised of Manufactured Housing (\"MH\") and Industrial)\nâ¢ Revenue of $300 million increased 13%; estimated wholesale MH industry unit shipments\nincreased 17%; total housing starts decreased 3%.\nâ¢ Estimated content per wholesale MH unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) increased 1% to\n$6,518. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, estimated content per wholesale MH unit\nincreased 1%.\nBalance Sheet, Cash Flow and Capital Allocation\nFor the first nine months of 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $224 million compared to $294\nmillion for the prior year period, with the change primarily driven by investments in working capital. Purchases\nof property, plant and equipment totaled $18 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting maintenance capital\nexpenditures and continued investments in alignment with our automation and technology initiatives. On a\ntrailing twelve-month basis, free cash flow through the third quarter of 2024 was $277 million, compared to\n$412 million through the third quarter of 2023 when we aggressively monetized working capital in a declining\n2\nsales environment. Our long-term debt increased approximately $70 million during the third quarter of 2024,\nprimarily as the result of the RecPro acquisition, which closed on September 6, 2024.\nWe remained disciplined in allocating and deploying capital, returning approximately $12 million to\nshareholders in the third quarter of 2024 through dividends. We remain opportunistic on share repurchases\nand had $78 million left authorized under our current share repurchase plan at the end of the third quarter.\nOur total debt at the end of the third quarter was approximately $1.4 billion, resulting in a total net leverage\nratio of 2.6x (as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement). Available liquidity, comprised of\nborrowing availability under our credit facility and cash on hand, was approximately $458 million.\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, we reduced our cost of debt and increased our liquidity position by\nissuing $500 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2032 and expanding the capacity of our credit facility to $1.0\nbillion, while extending the maturity date to October 2029. We plan to use a portion of the proceeds from\nthese transactions to redeem our 7.500% Senior Notes on November 7, 2024. Following these transactions,\nthe Company's next major debt maturity will be in 2028.\nBusiness Outlook and Summary\n\"Our team remains confident in the strength of our brand portfolio, disciplined operating model, earnings\npower of the business, and the profitable runway of opportunity that exists in each of our primary end\nmarkets,\" continued Mr. Nemeth. \"We are intensely focusing on elevating the customer experience,\ninvigorating our team's entrepreneurial spirit, winning additional market share by exceeding customer\nexpectations, and growing the business through accretive acquisitions while strategically allocating capital\ntoward automation and innovation initiatives. Over the last year, the teams at Patrick, in collaboration with our\nAdvanced Product Group, have significantly expanded our product development and prototyping activities as\na way to bring next-generation solutions to our customers over the next few years. We are optimistic that a\npositive demand inflection will occur in 2025, and believe recent interest rate reductions, lower inflation levels\nand continued solid economic data are important ingredients to bring this recovery to fruition, at which point\nour business is sized and scaled to pivot in alignment with our customers' needs. We are deeply appreciative\nof the incredible commitment and dedication of our team members and energized by their efforts and drive\neach and every day.\"\nConference Call Webcast\nPatrick Industries will host an online webcast of its third quarter 2024 earnings conference call that can be\naccessed on the Companyâs website, www.patrickind.com, under âFor Investors,â on Thursday, October 31,\n2024 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

These metrics should not be considered alternatives\nto U.S. GAAP. Our computations of net leverage ratio, content per unit, free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA,\nadjusted net income, adjusted dilutive EPS, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA margin and available\nliquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Content per unit metrics are generally calculated\nusing our market sales divided by Company estimates based on third-party measures of industry volume. We\ncalculate EBITDA by adding back depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, and income tax expense to\nnet income. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by taking EBITDA and adding back stock-based compensation and loss\non sale of property, plant and equipment, acquisition related costs, acquisition-related fair-value inventory step-up\nadjustments and subtracting out gain on sale of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted net\nincome is calculated by removing the impact of acquisition related transaction costs, net of tax and acquisition-\nrelated fair-value inventory step-up adjustments, net of tax. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated as adjusted net\nincome divided by our weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted operating\nmargin is calculated by removing the impact of acquisition related transaction costs and acquisition-related fair-\nvalue inventory step-up adjustments. We calculate free cash flow by subtracting cash paid for purchases of\nproperty, plant and equipment from cash flow from operations. RV wholesale unit shipments are provided by the RV\nIndustry Association. Marine wholesale unit shipments are Company estimates based on data provided by the\nNational Marine Manufacturers Association. MH wholesale unit shipments are provided by the Manufactured\nHousing Institute. Housing starts are provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.
