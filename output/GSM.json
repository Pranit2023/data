We are taking appropriate actions to reduce production in response to current demand trends. We are optimistic that demand will improve in 2025 as the year progresses.\n\n“We see significant potential in 2025 in the U.S. ferrosilicon market. The US Department of Commerce has imposed final anti-dumping and countervailing duties of 283% and 748%, respectively, on all Russian ferrosilicon imports. On November 1, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Brazil, Kazakhstan, and Malaysia, ranging from 1% to 22%. In addition, preliminary countervailing duties ranging from 2.4% to 61.7% were announced in September against Brazil, Kazakhstan and Malaysia.\n\n“As part of our next ESG Report, we will announce a decarbonization objective of reducing scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by at least 26% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline as part of our goal to enhance sustainability and transparency,” concluded Dr. Levi.\n\n**_Consolidated Sales_**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Ferroglobe reported net sales of $433.5 million, a decrease of 3.9% over the prior quarter and an increase of 4.0% from the comparable prior year period. This decrease over the prior quarter is primarily attributable to lower sales volumes in our portfolio products, partially offset by higher pricing in silicon metal and manganese-based specialty alloys. Silicon metal, silicon-based alloys and manganese-based alloys declined in sales by $10.4 million, $3.5 million and $8.4 million, respectively.\n\n**Product Category Highlights**\n\n**_Silicon Metal_**\n\n**($,000)**| **Q3 2024**| **Q2 2024**| **% Q/Q**| **Q3 2023**| **% Y/Y**| **YTD 2024**| **YTD 2023**| **% Y/Y**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nShipments in metric tons:| 56,910| 62,872| (9.5| )%| 57,031| (0.2| )%| 172,965| 144,624| 19.6| %  \nAverage selling price ($/MT):| 3,401| 3,244| 4.8| %| 3,481| (2.3| )%| 3,268| 3,834| (14.8| )%  \n**Silicon Metal Revenue**| **193,551**| **203,957**| (5.1| )%| **198,525**| (2.5| )%| **565,250**| **554,488**|  1.9| %  \n**Silicon Metal Adj.EBITDA**| **40,554**| **34,584**|  17.3| %| **80,823**| (49.8| )%| **91,209**| **194,347**| (53.1| )%  \n**Silicon Metal Adj.EBITDA Margin**|  21.0| %| 17.0| %| 40.7| %| 16.1| %| 35.0| %  \n  \nSilicon metal revenue in the third quarter was $193.6 million, a decrease of 5.1% over the prior quarter and a decrease of 2.5% from the comparable prior period. Average realized selling price increased by 4.8%, and shipments decreased due to lower volumes in EMEA and the U.S. The adjusted EBITDA for silicon metal increased 17.3% to $40.6 million during the third quarter, compared with $34.6 million for the prior quarter. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was mainly driven by higher average selling price and energy compensation in France.\n\n**_Silicon-Based Alloys_**\n\n**($,000)**| **Q3 2024**| **Q2 2024**| **% Q/Q**| **Q3 2023**| **% Y/Y**| **YTD 2024**| **YTD 2023**| **% Y/Y**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nShipments in metric tons:| 45,489| 46,953| (3.1| )%| 46,427| (2.0| )%| 143,613| 144,984| (0.9| )%  \nAverage selling price ($/MT):| 2,237| 2,241| (0.2| )%| 2,475| (9.6| )%| 2,221| 2,645| (16.0| )%  \n**Silicon-based Alloys Revenue**| **101,759**| **105,222**| (3.3| )%| **114,907**| (11.4| )%| **318,964**| **383,483**| (16.8| )%  \n**Silicon-based Alloys Adj.EBITDA**| **2,356**| **10,199**| (76.9| )%| **25,402**| (90.7| )%| **26,967**| **79,138**| (65.9| )%  \n**Silicon-based Alloys Adj.EBITDA Margin**|  2.3| %| 9.7| %| 22.1| %| 8.5| %| 20.6| %  \n  \nSilicon-based alloy revenue in the third quarter was $101.8 million, a decrease of 3.3% over the prior quarter and a decrease of 11.4% from the comparable prior period. Shipments decreased by 3.1%, which was attributable to demand weakness. Adjusted EBITDA for the silicon-based alloys decreased to $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 76.9% compared with $10.2 million for the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased mainly due to cost deterioration attributed to volume declines, lower fixed cost absorption and decreasing efficiency.\n\n**_Manganese-Based Alloys_**\n\n**($,000)**| **Q3 2024**| **Q2 2024**| **% Q/Q**| **Q3 2023**| **% Y/Y**| **YTD 2024**| **YTD 2023**| **% Y/Y**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nShipments in metric tons:| 64,495| 81,464| (20.8| )%| 56,399| 14.4| %| 208,279| 165,839| 25.6| %  \nAverage selling price ($/MT):| 1,391| 1,204| 15.5| %| 1,046| 33.0| %| 1,221| 1,198| 1.9| %  \n**Manganese-based Alloys Revenue**| **89,713**| **98,083**| (8.5| )%| **58,993**|  52.1| %| **254,309**| **198,675**|  28.0| %  \n**Manganese-based Alloys Adj.EBITDA**| **27,854**| **13,832**|  101.4| %| **11,000**|  153.2| %| **47,206**| **14,107**|  234.6| %  \n**Manganese-based Alloys Adj.EBITDA Margin**|  31.0| %| 14.1| %| 18.6| %| 18.6| %| 7.1| %  \n  \nManganese-based alloy revenue in the third quarter was $89.7 million, a decrease of 8.5% over the prior quarter and an increase of 52.1% from the comparable prior period. The average realized selling price increased by 15.5% and total shipments decreased by 20.8%. Adjusted EBITDA for the manganese-based alloys portfolio increased to $27.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 101.4% compared with $13.8 million for the prior quarter. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was mainly driven by higher sales prices and the energy compensation in France in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**_Raw materials and energy consumption for production_**\n\nRaw materials and energy consumption for production was $256.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 versus $264.3 million in the prior quarter, a decrease of 3.1%. As a percentage of sales, raw materials and energy consumption for production was 59% in the third quarter of 2024, equivalent to the prior quarter. Cost improvement compared to the previous quarter was driven by a decrease in energy costs in France and Spain and lower raw material prices, primarily manganese ore.\n\n**_Net Income Attributable to the Parent_**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, net income attributable to the parent was $18.8 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to a net income attributable to the parent of $34.9 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in the second quarter. The Company reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.11 for the third quarter, compared with adjusted earnings per share of $0.13 per share in the prior quarter.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, adjusted EBITDA was $60.4 million, or 13.9% of sales, an increase of 1% compared to adjusted EBITDA of $57.7 million, or 12.8% of sales, from the second quarter of 2024. This was mainly driven by stronger pricing.\n\n**_Total Cash, Adjusted Gross Debt and Working Capital_**\n\n**($ in millions)**| **Q3 2024**| **Q2 2024**| **$**| **%**| **Q3 2023**| **$**| **%Y/Y**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nTotal Cash1| $| 120.8| $| 144.5| (23.7| )| (16| %)| $| 166.0| (45.2| )| (27| %)  \nAdjusted Gross Debt2| $| 89.0| $| 80.7| 8.3| 10| %| $| 237.1| (148.0| )| (62| %)  \nNet (Cash)/Debt| $| (31.8| )| $| (63.7| )| 31.9| 50| %| $| 71.1| (102.9| )| (145| %)  \nTotal Working Capital| $| 528.6| $| 499.1| 29.5| 6| %| $| 510.1| 18.6| 4| %  \n  \n(1) Total cash is comprised of restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents(2) Adjusted gross debt excludes bank borrowings on factoring program and impact of leasing standard IFRS16 for each of the periods presented\n\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents was $120.8 million as of September 30, 2024, down $23.7 million from $144.5 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\nDuring the third quarter, the Company generated $11.1 million in cash flow from operations, used $20.4 million in cash flow from investing activities and used $16.4 million in cash flows from financing activities, mainly due to loan repayments of $6.6 million, payments for lease liabilities of $5.8 million and dividend payments of $2.4 million\n\nTotal working capital was $528.6 million on September 30, 2024, up from $499.1 million on June 30, 2024. The $29.5 million increase in working capital balance during the quarter was mainly due to a $12.3 million increase in trade and other receivables, $10.3 million increase in inventories and $6.9 million decrease in trade and other payables .\n\nBeatriz García-Cos, Ferroglobe’s Chief Financial Officer, commented, “We posted a strong adjusted EBITDA of $60 million in the third quarter and are reiterating our annual adjusted EBITDA guidance of $150 million to $170 million. Our working capital increased during the quarter as we are preparing for earlier idling of certain operations in the fourth quarter to manage inventory and preserve cash.”\n\n**Capital Returns**\n\nDuring the third quarter, Ferroglobe repurchased approximately 117,000 shares at an average price of $4.22 per share and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.013 per share on September 27, 2024. Our next cash dividend of $0.013 per share will be paid on December 27, 2024, to shareholders of record as of December 20, 2024.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nFerroglobe invites all interested persons to participate on its conference call at 8:30 AM, Eastern Time on November 7, 2024.

Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but are based on certain assumptions of management and describe the Company’s future plans, strategies and expectations. Forward-looking statements often use forward-looking terminology, including words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “guidance”, “intends”, “likely”, “may”, “plan”, “potential”, “predicts”, “seek”, “target”, “will” and words of similar meaning or the negative thereof.\n\nForward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on information currently available to the Company and assumptions that management believe to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain.
