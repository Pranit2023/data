(NASDAQ: ACLX), a biotechnology company reimagining cell therapy through the development of innovative immunotherapies for patients with cancer and other incurable diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided recent business highlights. \n\n“We believe the data from the recently published ASH abstracts continues to differentiate anito-cel’s clinical profile as a potentially best-in-class treatment option for multiple myeloma patients,” said Rami Elghandour, Arcellx’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The 30.2-month median progression-free survival demonstrated in our Phase 1 study in a challenging patient cohort coupled with the promising results from our iMMagine-1 Phase 2 registrational study highlight the potential impact we could have for patients. That impact is further enhanced by the high tolerability demonstrated through both the Phase 1 and iMMagine-1 studies to date, where notably, no delayed or non-ICANS neurotoxicities were observed in the over 140 patients treated to date. Patients and clinicians evaluate cell therapies on their safety, efficacy, delivery reliability, service, and accessibility. We believe we’re well positioned to deliver on these important factors in a differentiated way that best serves the multiple myeloma community. Our partnership with Kite allows us to leverage their established global commercial capabilities, positive brand recognition with physicians, and industry-leading manufacturing reliability and turnaround times which we believe contributes to our competitive advantage. It’s an exciting time at Arcellx! We are preparing for the commercial launch of anito-cel as there remains an unmet need for a therapy that physicians can use across a broad patient population.” \n\n**Recent Business Progress**\n\nAnnounced presentations at the 66 th American Society for Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition: \n\n**Phase 2 Registrational Study of Anitocabtagene Autoleucel for the Treatment of Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma: Preliminary Results From the iMMagine-1 Trial (abstract #1031)**\n\nAs detailed in the abstract (#1031) as of June 1, 2024, 58 patients had received anito-cel infusion with ≥2 months of follow-up after infusion, with a median follow-up of 10.3 months (range, 2.0-17.8). The median age was 66 years (range, 38-77). Patients had received a median of four prior lines of treatment (range, 3-8) with 26 patients (45%) having received only three prior lines of treatment. Forty patients (69%) were triple-class refractory and 20 (34%) were penta-class refractory. \n\nInvestigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria was 95% (55/58) with a complete response/stringent complete response (CR/sCR) rate of 62% (36/58). Of those evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) testing (n=39), 36 (92%) achieved MRD negativity at least to the level of 10 -5 . The Kaplan–Meier-estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates (95% CI) were 90% (77-96) and 95% (85-98), respectively. Median (mPFS) and median OS have not yet been reached. \n\nNo delayed neurotoxicities, including no parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barré syndrome have been observed to date. Forty-six patients (79%) had either no cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (n=9, 16%) or Grade (Gr) 1 CRS (n=37, 64%). Thirty-one patients (53%) had no fever or CRS in the first four days of anito-cel. Any Grade CRS was observed in 49 patients (84%; Gr3/4 0%). Any Grade ICANS was observed in 5 patients (9%; Gr3 2%), with all cases resolved without sequelae. Three deaths occurred due to adverse events (AEs) (both related and unrelated; retroperitoneal hemorrhage, CRS, and fungal infection). No additional treatment or therapy-related deaths or Grade ≥3 CRS or ICANs events have occurred to date. Cytopenias were the most common Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs; 36 patients (62%) had Grade ≥3 neutropenia, 15 (26%) had Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, and 15 (26%) had Grade ≥3 anemia. \n\n**Conclusions**\n\nPreliminary results from the first 58 patients in the Phase 2 iMMagine-1 study demonstrate deep and durable responses and manageable safety in a high-risk fourth line or higher (4L+) RRMM population including triple- and penta-class refractory disease. Notably, no delayed neurotoxicities, including no cranial nerve palsies, Guillain-Barré syndrome, or Parkinsonian-like symptoms have been observed with anito-cel to date. Updated Phase 2 data with a more recent data cut will be presented at the oral presentation during ASH. \n\n** Presentation details: **\n\n**Speaker** : Ciara Freeman, M.D., Ph.D., H.

All 38 patients demonstrated investigator-assessed clinical response per 2016 IMWG criteria, (ORR, 100%) with 30 CR/sCR (≥CR rate, 79%), 5 very good partial response (≥VGPR rate, 92%), and 3 partial response (PR). Of those evaluable for MRD testing (n=28), 25 (89%) achieved MRD negativity at 10 -5 . With a median follow-up of 38.1 months, median OS was not reached and median PFS was 30.2 months. The safety profile was manageable with no delayed neurotoxicities observed to date, including no parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barré syndrome. Further investigations of anito-cel are ongoing in 4L+ RRMM (iMMagine-1, NCT05396885) and in earlier lines (iMMagine-3, NCT06413498). \n\n** Presentation details: **\n\n**Speaker** : Michael R.

This SLR synthesized studies that reported data for key multiple myeloma HRQoL instruments. It found that patients with RRMM had clinically meaningful impairments from population norms in important domains, such as Global Health Status and cognitive, physical, and emotional functioning. The SLR also found that pre-treatment HRQoL worsened with increasing lines of therapy. \n\n** Presentation details: **\n\n**Speaker** : Rahul Banerjee, M.D., Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center **Session Name** : 653.

This study found no clear standard of care in the 4L+ setting, and suboptimal health outcomes under the current treatment landscape (ORR=34%, PFS=4.1 months, and OS=15.4 months), emphasizing an urgent need for more effective and durable therapies for patients in this setting. This abstract will be published in a supplemental issue of _Blood_ in November 2024. \n\nFirst patients dosed in iMMagine-3, a global randomized Phase 3 study, assessing anito-cel in patients previously treated with both an immunomodulatory (IMiD) drug and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Kite is manufacturing for this study. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n**Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities:**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Arcellx had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $676.7 million. Arcellx anticipates that its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will fund its operations into 2027. \n\n**Collaboration revenue:**\n\nCollaboration revenue were $26.0 million and $15.0 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $11.0 million. This increase was primarily driven by the December 2023 expansion to the license and collaboration agreement with Kite Pharma, Inc. \n\n**R &D expenses:**\n\nResearch and development expenses were $39.2 million and $43.8 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of $4.6 million. This decrease was primarily driven by an expense in 2023 associated with our Lonza manufacturing services agreement. The decrease was partially offset by increased costs relating to other preclinical pipeline programs and increased personnel costs, which include non-cash stock-based compensation expense. \n\n**G &A expenses:**\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $20.5 million and $16.0 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $4.5 million. This increase was primarily driven by increased personnel costs, which include non-cash stock-based compensation expense. \n\n**Net losses:**\n\nNet losses were $25.9 million and $39.3 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\n**Upcoming Webcast Event:**\n\nArcellx will host a live webcast event with an expert panel of clinicians on Monday, December 9, 2024, at 8:30 p.m. PT to discuss clinical results from its Phase 1 and iMMagine-1 trials.

Prior to randomization, investigator’s choice of SOC regimens include: pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (PVd); daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd); carfilzomib, daratumumab and dexamethasone (KDd); or carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd). Patients in the anito-cel arm will undergo leukapheresis and optional bridging therapy (with the SOC regimen selected by the investigator prior to randomization) followed by lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /d and cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 /d for 3 days) and one infusion of anito-cel (115×10 6 CAR+ T cells) on Day 1. The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) per blinded independent review according to the 2016 IMWG uniform response criteria for MM with the hypothesis that anito-cel will prolong PFS compared to SOC. Key secondary endpoints include complete response rate (CR/sCR), minimal residual disease negativity, overall survival, and safety. \n\n**Forward-looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The company will also have a medical affairs booth (#1615) in Hall E of the San Diego Convention Center. \n\n**Phase 2 Registrational Study of Anitocabtagene Autoleucel for the Treatment of Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma: Preliminary Results From the iMMagine-1 Trial (abstract #1031)**\n\nAs detailed in the abstract (#1031) as of June 1, 2024, 58 patients had received anito-cel infusion with ≥2 months of follow-up after infusion, with a median follow-up of 10.3 months (range, 2.0-17.8). The median age was 66 years (range, 38-77). Patients had received a median of four prior lines of treatment (range, 3-8) with 26 patients (45%) having received only three prior lines of treatment. Forty patients (69%) were triple-class refractory and 20 (34%) were penta-class refractory. \n\nInvestigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria was 95% (55/58) with a complete response/stringent complete response (CR/sCR) rate of 62% (36/58). Of those evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) testing (n=39), 36 (92%) achieved MRD negativity at least to the level of 10 -5 . The Kaplan–Meier-estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates (95% CI) were 90% (77-96) and 95% (85-98), respectively. Median (mPFS) and median OS have not yet been reached. \n\nNo delayed neurotoxicities, including no parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barré syndrome have been observed to date. Forty-six patients (79%) had either no cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (n=9, 16%) or Grade (Gr) 1 CRS (n=37, 64%). Thirty-one patients (53%) had no fever or CRS in the first four days of anito-cel. Any Grade CRS was observed in 49 patients (84%; Gr3/4 0%). Any Grade ICANS was observed in 5 patients (9%; Gr3 2%), with all cases resolved without sequelae. Three deaths occurred due to adverse events (AEs) (both related and unrelated; retroperitoneal hemorrhage, CRS, and fungal infection). No additional treatment or therapy-related deaths or Grade ≥3 CRS or ICANs events have occurred to date. Cytopenias were the most common Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs; 36 patients (62%) had Grade ≥3 neutropenia, 15 (26%) had Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, and 15 (26%) had Grade ≥3 anemia. \n\n**Conclusions**\n\nPreliminary results from the first 58 patients in the Phase 2 iMMagine-1 study demonstrate deep and durable responses and manageable safety in a high-risk fourth line or higher (4L+) RRMM population including triple- and penta-class refractory disease. Notably, no delayed neurotoxicities, including no cranial nerve palsies, Guillain-Barré syndrome, or Parkinsonian-like symptoms have been observed with anito-cel to date. Updated Phase 2 data with a more recent data cut will be presented at the oral presentation during ASH. \n\n** Presentation details: **  \n---  \n**Speaker** : Ciara Freeman, M.D., Ph.D., H.

All 38 patients demonstrated investigator-assessed clinical response per 2016 IMWG criteria, (ORR, 100%) with 30 CR/sCR (≥CR rate, 79%), 5 very good partial response (≥VGPR rate, 92%), and 3 partial response (PR). Of those evaluable for MRD testing (n=28), 25 (89%) achieved MRD negativity at 10 -5 . With a median follow-up of 38.1 months, median OS was not reached and median PFS was 30.2 months. The safety profile was manageable with no delayed neurotoxicities observed to date, including no parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barré syndrome. Further investigations of anito-cel are ongoing in 4L+ RRMM (iMMagine-1, NCT05396885) and in earlier lines (iMMagine-3, NCT06413498). \n\n** Presentation details:  **  \n---  \n**Speaker** : Michael R.

This SLR synthesized studies that reported data for key multiple myeloma HRQoL instruments. It found that patients with RRMM had clinically meaningful impairments from population norms in important domains, such as Global Health Status and cognitive, physical, and emotional functioning. The SLR also found that pre-treatment HRQoL worsened with increasing lines of therapy. \n\n** Presentation details: **  \n---  \n**Speaker** : Rahul Banerjee, M.D., Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center   \n**Session Name** : 653.

These abnormal plasma cells also produce excessive quantities of an abnormal immunoglobulin fragment, called a myeloma protein (M protein), causing kidney damage and impairing the patient's immune function. Multiple myeloma is the third most common hematological malignancy in the United States and Europe, representing approximately 10% of all hematological cancer cases and 20% of deaths due to hematological malignancies. The median age of patients at diagnosis is 69 years with one-third of patients diagnosed at an age of at least 75 years. Because MM tends to afflict patients at an advanced stage of life, patients often have multiple co-morbidities and toxicities that can quickly escalate and become life-endangering. \n\n**About Anitocabtagene Autoleucel (anito-cel)**\n\nAnitocabtagene autoleucel (anito-cel, previously ddBCMA) is the first BCMA-directed CAR T-cell therapy to be investigated in multiple myeloma that utilizes Arcellx’s novel and compact binder known as the D-Domain. Anito-cel has been granted Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \n\n**About iMMagine-3, A Global Phase 3 Randomized Controlled Clinical Study**\n\niMMagine-3 is a global Phase 3, randomized controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of anitocabtagene autoleucel (anito-cel) with standard of care in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received one to three prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory drug (lMiD) and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. \n\niMMagine-3 will enroll approximately 450 adult patients. Prior to randomization, investigator’s choice of SOC regimens include: pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (PVd); daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd); carfilzomib, daratumumab, and dexamethasone (KDd); or carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd). Patients in the anito-cel arm will undergo leukapheresis and optional bridging therapy (with the SOC regimen selected by the investigator prior to randomization) followed by lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine 30 mg/m2/d and cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2/d for 3 days) and one infusion of anito-cel (115×106 CAR+ T cells) on Day 1. \n\nThe primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded independent review according to the 2016 IMWG uniform response criteria for MM with the hypothesis that anito-cel will prolong PFS compared to SOC. Key secondary endpoints include complete response rate (CR/sCR), minimal residual disease negativity, overall survival, and safety. \n\nThe iMMagine-3 study initiated in the second half of 2024 at approximately 130 study sites across North America, Europe, and the rest of the world. \n\n**About Arcellx and Kite Collaboration**\n\nArcellx and Kite, a Gilead Company, formed a global strategic collaboration and license agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize anito-cel for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, RRMM. Anito-cel is currently being developed in a Phase 2 registrational pivotal study and a global Phase 3 randomized controlled study for RRMM. Kite and Arcellx will jointly commercialize the anito-cel asset in the United States, and Kite will commercialize the product outside the United States. \n\n**About Arcellx, Inc.**\n\nArcellx, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company reimagining cell therapy by engineering innovative immunotherapies for patients with cancer and other incurable diseases.

(NASDAQ: ACLX), a biotechnology company reimagining cell therapy through the development of innovative immunotherapies for patients with cancer and other incurable diseases, today reported business highlights and financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n“We continue to make significant strides as we accelerate our business,” said Rami Elghandour, Arcellx’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We are thrilled about the momentum across our multiple myeloma program being developed in partnership with Kite. We believe anito-cel has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment option, and with the strength of our Kite partnership, we are well-positioned to change the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma patients. We look forward to presenting data from the iMMagine-1 study by the end of this year. As iMMagine-1 continues to mature, we’re also pleased with the progress in iMMagine-3, which was initiated by our partner Kite. More broadly, we believe that our novel synthetic binder, the D-Domain, which forms the basis of our technology platform and our lead program anito-cel, can be developed in oncology and non-oncology indications. We are excited to share that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared our IND application for the development of anito-cel to treat patients with myasthenia gravis. Our progress this quarter reflects our incredible team and their dedication to advancing our mission of helping as many patients as possible by delivering on the promise of our platform.” \n\n** Recent Business Progress **\n\n  * The Company earned a $68 million clinical milestone payment from Kite Pharma, Inc., a Gilead Company, for iMMagine-1 enrollment. \n  * The Company submitted an abstract to present data for the iMMagine-1 study at the 66 th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition. \n  * Kite has initiated the global Phase 3 trial, iMMagine-3. This trial will evaluate anito-cel in patients exposed to an immunomodulatory (lMiD) drug and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. \n  * The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for anito-cel, Arcellx’s BCMA CAR-T therapy, for myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune disease.
