(“Lantheus” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: LNTH), the leading radiopharmaceutical-focused company committed to enabling clinicians to Find, Fight and Follow disease to deliver better patient outcomes, notes that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently posted [updated payment rates in Addendum B](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6FIqvH_gURFg5bl-28-NRxzR1nremm_BkfhNrXOk_f68Hb-25Ixo5TDmK1qab27s6EbigzBu7cMSxakWYV1eMWyXtS7ZaO38OmwFFAL_2bVUQKkeny5zwICB6xxmmNRnA2C6A1_zAGmqnjYk1WPvPFlRCB9mNb7rDtfdDgzRAaqMeuvyFs-1evIjbt7nZrFsEa9oJjFoMSgrJSZ0U5Z3VRUYwyF4h-aSR2bO-krZDxc=) related to the final rule for the calendar year 2025 Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). The Company continues to commend CMS for recognizing the value of and ensuring broad patient access to specialized diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals. With PYLARIFY® (piflufolastat F 18) on track to exceed $1 billion in sales in 2024, Lantheus reaffirms its 2025 outlook for PYLARIFY as a blockbuster brand that will continue to be the clear standard and #1 ordered PSMA PET imaging agent in the U.S.\n\nUnder the new OPPS rules, previously packaged diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals will now be “unbundled” with payments being made separately for any diagnostic radiopharmaceutical with a per day cost greater than $630. These changes enable innovative diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including PYLARIFY, to continue to be paid separately by CMS for the approximately twenty percent of traditional Medicare Fee for Service (FFS) patients in the hospital outpatient setting following the expiry of pass-through payment status at a rate that reflects mean unit cost. The final rule will go into effect January 1, 2025.\n\n**About PYLARIFY** ®**(piflufolastat F 18) Injection** PYLARIFY® (piflufolastat F 18) injection (also known as 18F-DCFPyL or PyL) is a fluorinated small molecule PSMA-targeted PET imaging agent that enables visualization of lymph nodes, bone and soft tissue metastases to determine the presence or absence of recurrent and/or metastatic prostate cancer. For men with prostate cancer, PYLARIFY PET combines the accuracy of PET imaging, the precision of PSMA targeting and the clarity of an F 18 radioisotope for superior diagnostic performance. The recommended PYLARIFY dose is 333 MBq (9 mCi) with an acceptable range of 296 MBq to 370 MBq (8 mCi to 10 mCi), administered as a bolus intravenous injection.1-6\n\nPYLARIFY has made a profound impact on the lives of patients battling prostate cancer. It is the number one ordered PSMA PET imaging agent in the U.S., and is a proven diagnostic backed by real-world experience, including in over 400,000 scans across 48 states.\n\n**PYLARIFY****®** **(piflufolastat F 18) Injection**\n\n**Indication**\n\nPYLARIFY® (piflufolastat F 18) Injection is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer:\n\n  * with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy.\n  * with suspected recurrence based on elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.\n\n\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n**Contraindications**\n\nNone.**Warnings and Precautions**\n\n**Risk of Image Misinterpretation** Imaging interpretation errors can occur with PYLARIFY imaging. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of patients with biochemical evidence of recurrence of prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels. The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by risk factors such as Gleason score and tumor stage. PYLARIFY uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non-malignant processes and in normal tissues. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended.\n\n**Hypersensitivity Reactions** Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions, particularly patients with a history of allergy to other drugs and foods. Reactions may be delayed. Always have trained staff and resuscitation equipment available.\n\n**Radiation Risks** Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including PYLARIFY, expose patients to radiation. Radiation exposure is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration.\n\n**Adverse Reactions** The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headaches, dysgeusia and fatigue, occurring at rate of ≤2% during clinical studies with PYLARIFY. In addition, a delayed hypersensitivity reaction was reported in one patient (0.2%) with a history of allergic reactions.\n\n**Drug interactions**\n\nAndrogen deprivation therapy (ADT) and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway, such as androgen receptor antagonists, may result in changes in uptake of PYLARIFY in prostate cancer. The effect of these therapies on performance of PYLARIFY PET has not been established.To report suspected adverse reactions for PYLARIFY, call 1-800-362-2668 or contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or [www.fda.gov/medwatch](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EhLXjoI69WYWMfBuisS7ORhgz1D5wZrUw73yf74N8MGk4BTtXkC2n26oP1SFHc_VCYvULOVzz2JF1jVTffzvz1l_M04Cjiv65rN6NlkIrTw=).\n\nPlease read the accompanying full [Prescribing Information](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zvVyYAmsLDW1OW-CBmetvz8N2rxx1a78pKrgVHFZiv0tIrr2cnuyF6o08kIr4LDWmn4GR8QmWrPReQewPwGGF2NpqXZvldaOFqIQdx8_jv5DKvvfDmORr0Okd3My3DZDeCaQ8iBrp9uvB9gA5cUvcomtnsZ7ZIhTh3D8wB3QrTdqVNt496MM5pUck5B6p0L6) also available at [PYLARIFY.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4PTGdRDWl94bH36cvUr93MIGjLaDLi7wbotWz-9LrCw5Ea_68MsWWyhcgdKbcrXhCXiIT56rzyKejBkjyr-vkA==).\n\n**About Lantheus **\n\nLantheus is the leading radiopharmaceutical-focused company, delivering life-changing science to enable clinicians to Find, Fight and Follow disease to deliver better patient outcomes.

(Lantheus or the Company) (NASDAQ: LNTH), the leading radiopharmaceutical-focused company committed to enabling clinicians to Find, Fight and Follow disease to deliver better patient outcomes, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“PYLARIFY is on track to exceed $1 billion in sales in 2024 and maintain its market leadership and blockbuster status in 2025,” said Brian Markison, Chief Executive Officer of Lantheus. “The success of our flagship diagnostic agents enables us to invest, organically and inorganically in our pipeline to advance our radiopharmaceutical leadership. We are excited about our growing portfolio, especially oncology radiotherapeutics and Alzheimer's disease radiodiagnostics, and will continue to expand our portfolio of late-stage and high potential early-stage product candidates. We are driving growth and shareholder value through operational excellence, financial discipline and prudent capital deployment.”\n\n**Summary Financial Results**\n\n_(in millions, except per share data – unaudited)_ | **Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \nWorldwide revenue | $ | 378.7 | $ | 319.9 | 18.4 | %  \nGAAP net income | $ | 131.1 | $ | 132.0 | (0.7 | )%  \nGAAP fully diluted earnings per share | $ | 1.79 | $ | 1.88 | (4.8 | )%  \nAdj. net income (non-GAAP) | $ | 124.1 | $ | 103.1 | 20.4 | %  \nAdj. fully diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) | $ | 1.70 | $ | 1.47 | 15.6 | %  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024**\n\n  * Worldwide revenue increased 18.4% to $378.7 million compared to the same period in 2023.\n  * Sales of PYLARIFY were $259.8 million, an increase of 20.6%. Growth was driven by increasing volumes at existing accounts with a slight net price offset as we secured strategic partnerships.\n  * Sales of DEFINITY were $77.0 million, an increase of 14.3%. Growth was driven by market growth and opportunistic sales due to competitor supply challenges.\n  * Operating income increased 19.0% to $133.7 million. Adjusted operating income (non-GAAP) increased 18.3% to $165.1 million.\n  * Fully diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.79, compared to $1.88 in the prior year period. Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) increased 15.6% to $1.70, compared to $1.47 in the prior year period.\n  * Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were $175.1 million and $159.3 million, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n  * At September 30, 2024, the Company's cash and cash equivalents grew to $866.4 million, compared to $713.7 million at December 31, 2023, even after accounting for the $35.0 million net investment related to the acquisition of RM2 from Life Molecular, a $5 million equity investment in Radiopharm Theranostics as well as a $10 million milestone payment related to the NAV-4694 asset in the third quarter 2024.\n  * The Company currently has access to up to $350.0 million from a revolving line of credit.\n\n\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n**_Radiopharmaceutical Pipeline Progress_**\n\n  * The Company announced an expansion of its Alzheimer’s disease portfolio in the third quarter, acquiring NAV-4694, a novel, next generation beta-amyloid imaging agent in Phase 3 clinical development. NAV-4694 complements MK-6240, Lantheus’ novel, next-generation, tau radiodiagnostic. The Company plans to submit New Drug Applications for MK-6240 in 2025 and NAV-4694 in 2026.\n  * With respect to the SPLASH Phase 3 registrational study of PNT2002, the second interim analysis performed at 75% of protocol specified events demonstrated results for radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) that did not materially change from the initial interim analysis conducted at 46% of specified events. PNT2002 is an investigational PSMA-targeted radiotherapeutic for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The SPLASH study met its primary endpoint of rPFS, which was a meaningful and statistically significant improvement for the PNT2002 arm vs. the alternate androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) or hormone therapy. The OS results and hazard ratio in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population remain confounded by the overwhelming number of patients who crossed over to receive PNT2002. Crossover adjusted analyses are post-hoc, and the Company will continue to review the data and perform additional sub-set analyses with our partner, Eli Lilly, that may be compelling to the FDA in preparation for an interaction on our path forward.\n\n\n\n**_Other Key Updates_**\n\n  * The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released its final Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) rule for calendar year 2025 which included improved payment for specialized diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals to support patient access for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries. In the rule, innovative diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including PYLARIFY, will be paid separately by CMS for traditional Medicare FFS patients in the hospital outpatient setting following the expiry of transitional pass-through payment status. The final rule will take effect January 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n**Full Year 2024 Financial Guidance**\n\n**Guidance Issued November 6, 2024** | **Guidance Issued July 31, 2024**  \n---|---  \nFY 2024 Revenue | $1.51 billion - $1.52 billion | $1.50 billion - $1.52 billion  \nFY 2024 Adjusted Fully Diluted EPS | $6.65 - $6.70 | $6.60 - $6.70  \n  \nOn a forward-looking basis, the Company does not provide GAAP income per common share guidance or a reconciliation of GAAP income per common share to adjusted fully diluted EPS because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty business development and acquisition related expenses, purchase accounting fair value adjustments, and any one-time, non-recurring charges. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to results computed in accordance with GAAP. As a result, it is the Company’s view that a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted fully diluted EPS on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable effort. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nAs previously announced, the Company will host a conference call and webcast on Wednesday, November 6, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. ET. To access the conference call or webcast, participants should register online at <https://investor.lantheus.com/news-events/calendar-of-events>.\n\nA replay will be available approximately two hours after completion of the webcast and will be archived on the same web page for at least 30 days.\n\nThe conference call will include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. Reference is made to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, the reconciliation of the differences between the two financial measures, and the other information included in this press release, our Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, or otherwise available in the Investor Relations section of our website located at [www.lantheus.com](http://www.lantheus.com).\n\nThe conference call may include forward-looking statements.

Management uses these and other non-GAAP measures internally for evaluation of the performance of the business, including the allocation of resources and the evaluation of results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements**\n\n_This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, that are subject to risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(“Lantheus”) (NASDAQ: LNTH), the leading radiopharmaceutical-focused company committed to enabling clinicians to Find, Fight and Follow disease to deliver better patient outcomes, applauds the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS) final rule for the calendar year 2025 Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). The rule, announced and detailed on the [CMS website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ms1ujk_Gv-rtDYpGjslAkK-x1Vd_4JA0RT-2yNX9EANxrXS6ZTT2nJ_8oG-d4Xg7y_M5phx2PztOBMZHxnfRq0fBiJPlotsrWf7bpIVvLrL3U3pL35e9br95i07dCQIQCEPJJZBQR_9YYN89kOTY8PksHO86JaGT25JC8QmrErDm0LdV_N_tcYpc4GTlTBXDtZbm9YO90d1SgC3lAK5tWrEKIsTG5pse6W8E5DO85M0=) late Friday, recognizes the value of and ensures broad patient access to specialized diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals by improving the accuracy of payment amounts for these products.\n\nUnder the new OPPS rules, previously packaged diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals will now be “unbundled” with payments being made separately for any diagnostic radiopharmaceutical with a per day cost greater than $630. These changes enable innovative diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including PYLARIFY® (piflufolastat F18), to continue to be paid separately by CMS for traditional Medicare Fee for Service (FFS) patients in the hospital outpatient setting following the expiry of pass-through payment status. The final rule will go into effect January 1, 2025.\n\n“Today’s landmark decision by CMS is a win for broader and more equitable patient access and supports long term innovation in the field of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals,” said Brian Markison, Chief Executive Officer of Lantheus. “At Lantheus, we applaud all those involved in spearheading reform of the payment structure for these potentially life-altering diagnostic tools for underserved populations with high unmet needs. We remain focused on supporting physicians and hospitals with our diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals to help achieve better patient outcomes for traditional Medicare FFS beneficiaries.”\n\n**About PYLARIFY** ®**(piflufolastat F 18) Injection** PYLARIFY® (piflufolastat F 18) injection (also known as 18F-DCFPyL or PyL) is a fluorinated small molecule PSMA-targeted PET imaging agent that enables visualization of lymph nodes, bone and soft tissue metastases to determine the presence or absence of recurrent and/or metastatic prostate cancer. For men with prostate cancer, PYLARIFY PET combines the accuracy of PET imaging, the precision of PSMA targeting and the clarity of an F 18 radioisotope for superior diagnostic performance. The recommended PYLARIFY dose is 333 MBq (9 mCi) with an acceptable range of 296 MBq to 370 MBq (8 mCi to 10 mCi), administered as a bolus intravenous injection.1-6\n\nPYLARIFY has made a profound impact on the lives of patients battling prostate cancer. It is the number one ordered PSMA PET imaging agent in the U.S., and is a proven diagnostic backed by real-world experience, including in over 400,000 scans across 48 states.\n\n**PYLARIFY****®** **(piflufolastat F 18) Injection**\n\n**Indication**\n\nPYLARIFY® (piflufolastat F 18) Injection is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer:\n\n  * with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy.\n  * with suspected recurrence based on elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.\n\n\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n**Contraindications** None.\n\n**Warnings and Precautions**\n\n**Risk of Image Misinterpretation** Imaging interpretation errors can occur with PYLARIFY imaging. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of patients with biochemical evidence of recurrence of prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels. The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by risk factors such as Gleason score and tumor stage. PYLARIFY uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non-malignant processes and in normal tissues. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended.\n\n**Hypersensitivity Reactions** Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions, particularly patients with a history of allergy to other drugs and foods. Reactions may be delayed. Always have trained staff and resuscitation equipment available.\n\n**Radiation Risks** Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including PYLARIFY, expose patients to radiation. Radiation exposure is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration.\n\n**Adverse Reactions** The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headaches, dysgeusia and fatigue, occurring at rate of ≤2% during clinical studies with PYLARIFY. In addition, a delayed hypersensitivity reaction was reported in one patient (0.2%) with a history of allergic reactions.\n\n**Drug interactions** Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway, such as androgen receptor antagonists, may result in changes in uptake of PYLARIFY in prostate cancer. The effect of these therapies on performance of PYLARIFY PET has not been established.\n\nTo report suspected adverse reactions for PYLARIFY, call 1-800-362-2668 or contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or [www.fda.gov/medwatch](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Pcx16czNFhG4Qm-G2-NafBSa_sKRaf9LkePAaBhu3oGyb038ZkFyeIw2SpnxorpYX9-f9Tr6s-4wsPd4pHB6rIA006QXC5MPmv0utAZC6f8=).\n\nPlease read the accompanying full [Prescribing Information](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=M2vB1JUhB3rqa5ss8WmlNOHLnwYOOZhTpwxoCH9A6B_Ih7bolVASNm7oqWJgnpMvrJHKSraxOAm5IXRVbBVVrDPD6ZMoqSsXw7fZ1GtxCrz6ahglpQHVGIiS-LoXCk6Nt0W6N9RWsBdb33NU0ipPC2pfX3PqP7PqKMCKFZC2b1MNi0D1zDF_Nr6YbIV2ZKce) also available at [PYLARIFY.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NiiggYQZhA2yhiZwsEjozWQT7lmCGZ48m2SZgySElpZHUqSibwZgJs3fyuY3vuEWLbZsrLuLOX9LDTc0s1Vugw==).\n\n**About Lantheus **\n\nLantheus is the leading radiopharmaceutical-focused company, delivering life-changing science to enable clinicians to Find, Fight and Follow disease to deliver better patient outcomes.
