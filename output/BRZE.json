Accordingly,\nreconciliations are not available without unreasonable effort, although it is important to note that these factors\ncould be material to Braze’s results calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nConference Call Information:\nWhat: Braze Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results Conference Call\nWhen: Thursday, September 5th at 4:30 pm EDT / 1:30 pm PDT\nWebcast & Supplemental Data: investors.braze.com\nReplay: A webcast replay will be available on Braze’s investor site at investors.braze.com.\nSupplemental and Other Financial Information\nSupplemental information, including an accompanying financial presentation and other information can be accessed\nthrough Braze’s investor website at investors.braze.com.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP\ngross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense,\nnon-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin,\nnon-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, and non-GAAP free cash\nflow. Braze defines non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP\nresearch and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating income\n(loss), non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted\nfor stock-based compensation expense, employer taxes related to stock-based compensation, charitable contribution\nexpense, contingent consideration adjustments, acquisition related expense, amortization of intangible assets, and\nrestructuring expense. Prior to the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, Braze did not adjust non-\nGAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development\nexpense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating\nmargin or non-GAAP net income (loss) for contingent consideration adjustments, because there were no such\nadjustments in prior periods. Braze defines non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating\nactivities, minus purchases of property and equipment and minus capitalized internal-use software costs. Investors\nare encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measures.\nBraze uses this non-GAAP financial information internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that this\nnon-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to\ninvestors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in\ncomparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their\nGAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and\nshould not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures\nused by other companies.\nThe principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are\nrequired by GAAP to be recorded in Braze’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations\nas they reflect the exercise of judgment by Braze’s management about which expenses are excluded or included in\ndetermining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below in the financial statement\ntables included below in this press release for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable\nfinancial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.\nBraze encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press\nreleases announcing quarterly and fiscal year financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any\nsingle financial measure to evaluate Braze’s business.\nDefinition of Other Business Metrics\nCustomer: Braze defines a customer, as of period end, as the separate and distinct, ultimate parent-level entity that\nhas an active subscription with Braze to use its products. A single organization could have multiple distinct\ncontracting divisions or subsidiaries, all of which together would be considered a single customer.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (ARR): Braze defines ARR as the annualized value of customer subscription contracts,\nincluding certain premium professional services that are subject to contractual subscription terms, as of the\nmeasurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms\n(including contracts for which Braze is negotiating a renewal). Braze’s calculation of ARR is not adjusted for the\nimpact of any known or projected future events (such as customer cancellations, expansion or contraction of existing\ncustomers relationships or price increases or decreases) that may cause any such contract not to be renewed on its\nexisting terms. ARR may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers’ satisfaction or\ndissatisfaction with Braze’s products and professional services, pricing, competitive offerings, economic conditions\nor overall changes in Braze’s customers’ spending levels. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and does\nnot represent Braze’s GAAP revenue on an annualized basis or a forecast of revenue, as it is an operating metric that\ncan be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates.\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate: Braze calculates dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with\nthe ARR from a cohort of customers as of 12 months prior to such period-end (the Prior Period ARR). Braze then\ncalculates the ARR from the same cohort of customers as of the end of the current period (the Current Period ARR).\nCurrent Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months, but\nexcludes ARR from new customers in the current period. Braze then divides the total Current Period ARR by the\ntotal Prior Period ARR to arrive at the point-in-time dollar-based net retention rate. Braze then calculates the\nweighted average point-in-time dollar-based net retention rates as of the last day of each month in the current trailing\n12-month period to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate.\nRemaining Performance Obligations: The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations\nrepresents amounts under non-cancelable contracts expected to be recognized as revenue in future periods, and may\nbe influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of service delivery and\ncontract terms. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation are subject to future economic risks\nincluding bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding Braze’s\nfinancial outlook for the third quarter of and the full fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.

These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections. Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “hope,” “intend,” “may,” might,” “potential,”\n“predict,” “project,” “shall,” “should,” “target,” “will,” and variations of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.\nForward-looking statements are based on Braze’s current assumptions, expectations and beliefs and are subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause Braze’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any\nfuture results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties related to: (1) unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on Braze’s business, financial\ncondition and share price; (2) Braze’s recent rapid revenue growth may not be indicative of its future revenue growth; (3) Braze’s history of operating losses; (4) Braze’s limited operating history at its current scale; (5) Braze’s ability to successfully manage its growth; (6) the accuracy of estimates of\nmarket opportunity and forecasts of market growth and the impact of global and domestic socioeconomic events on Braze’s business; (7) Braze’s ability and the ability of its platform to adapt and respond to changing customer or consumer needs, requirements or preferences; (8) Braze’s ability to\nattract new customers and renew existing customers; (9) the competitive markets in which Braze participates and the intense competition that it faces; (10) Braze’s ability to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving cybersecurity and data privacy risks, evolving\nindustry standards or changing regulations; and (11) Braze’s reliance on third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure; as well as other risks and uncertainties discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of Braze’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) on April 1, 2024 and other subsequent filings Braze makes with the SEC from time to time, including Braze’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2024 that will be filed with the SEC. The forward-looking statements included in this press release represent\nBraze’s views only as of the date of this press release and Braze assumes no obligation, and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP\noperating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, and non-GAAP free cash flow. Braze defines non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general\nand administrative expense, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, employer taxes related to stock-based compensation, charitable contribution\nexpense, contingent consideration adjustments, acquisition related expense, amortization of intangible assets, and restructuring expense. Prior to the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, Braze did not adjust non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing\nexpense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and margin or non-GAAP net income (loss) for acquisition related expense, because there was not acquisition activity by Braze in prior periods.\nAdditionally, prior to the second quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, Braze did not adjust non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP\noperating income (loss) and margin or non-GAAP net income (loss) for amortization of intangible assets, because there were no such amortizations in prior periods, or for restructuring expense, because such amounts were not material in prior periods. Further, prior to the fourth quarter of the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2024, Braze did not adjust non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin or\nnon-GAAP net income (loss) for contingent consideration adjustments, because there were no such adjustments in prior periods. Braze defines non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, minus purchases of property and equipment and minus capitalized\ninternal-use software costs. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Braze uses this non-GAAP financial information internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that\nthis non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP\nfinancial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States (GAAP), and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Braze’s financial statements. In\naddition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by Braze’s management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided at the end of this presentation for each non-GAAP\nfinancial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Braze encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly and fiscal year financial results, including this presentation, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Braze’s business. Braze has not reconciled its guidance as to non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating\nincome (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) or non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measure as a result of uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation\nawards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in Braze’s stock price. Accordingly, reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort, although it is important to note that these factors could be material to Braze’s results calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nCustomer Metrics and Market Data\nUnless otherwise noted, information in this presentation concerning Braze’s industry, including industry statistics and forecasts, competitive position and the markets in which Braze operates is based on information from independent industry and research organizations, other third-party sources\nand management estimates. Management estimates are derived from publicly available information released by independent industry analysts and other third party sources, as well as data from Braze's internal research, and are based on assumptions made by Braze upon reviewing such data,\nand Braze’s experience in, and knowledge of, such industry and markets, which it believes to be reasonable. Projections, forecasts, assumptions and estimates of the future performance of the industry in which Braze operates and Braze’s future performance are necessarily subject to uncertainty\nand risk due to a variety of factors. Braze has not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by independent industry and research organizations, other third parties or other publicly available information. Accordingly, Braze makes no representations as to the\naccuracy or completeness of that information nor does Braze undertake to update such information after the date of this presentation.\nTrademarks\nAll third-party trademarks, including names, logos and brands, referenced by Braze in this presentation are property of their respective owners.

A single\norganization could have multiple distinct contracting divisions or subsidiaries, all of which together would be considered a single customer.\nMonthly Active User: A monthly active user is an end user of a customer who has engaged with the customer’s applications and websites in the previous 30-day period. We include\neach distinguishable end user in our calculation of monthly active users, even though some users may access our customers’ applications and websites using more than one device,\nand multiple users may gain access using the same device.\nDollar-based Net Retention Rate: We calculate our dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from a cohort of customers as of 12 months prior to\nsuch period-end (the Prior Period ARR). We then calculate the ARR from the same cohort of customers as of the end of the current period (the Current Period ARR). Current Period\nARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months, but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total\nCurrent Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the point-in-time dollar-based net retention rate. We then calculate the weighted average point-in-time dollar-based net\nretention rates as of the last day of each month in the current trailing 12-month period to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (ARR): We define ARR as the annualized value of customer subscription contracts, including certain premium professional services that are subject to\ncontractual subscription terms, as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms (including contracts for\nwhich we are negotiating a renewal). Our calculation of ARR is not adjusted for the impact of any known or projected future events (such as customer cancellations, expansion or\ncontraction of existing customers relationships or price increases or decreases) that may cause any such contract not to be renewed on its existing terms.\nRemaining Performance Obligations: The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents amounts under non-cancelable contracts expected to be\nrecognized as revenue in future periods, and may be influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of service delivery and contract terms.\nUnbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation are subject to future economic risks including bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors.\n14\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nDOLLARS IN THOUSANDS\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Gross Margin Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Operating Expenses\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended Three Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31, July 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGAAP sales and marketing expense $68,569 $60,417 $138,396 $117,679\nLess:\nGross Profit $102,079 $79,633 $192,990 $148,726 Stock-based compensation expense 9,892 7,807 19,337 15,655\nEmployer taxes related to stock-based\n282 247 823 364\nPlus: compensation expense\nRestructuring expense - 541 - 541\nStock-based compensation expense 1,078 901 2,042 1,790 Non-GAAP sales and marketing $58,395 $51,822 $118,236 $101,119\nEmployer taxes related to stock-based\ncompensation expense 46 30 114 52 GAAP research and development expense $33,141 $29,132 $67,514 $58,877\nLess:\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit $103,203 $80,564 $195,146 $150,568 Stock-based compensation expense 11,448 9,929 22,280 19,772\nEmployer taxes related to stock-based\n344 266 1,180 522\ncompensation expense\nGAAP Gross Margin 70.2% 69.2% 68.7% 68.6%\nNon-GAAP research and development $21,349 $18,937 $44,054 $38,583\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin 70.9% 70.0% 69.5% 69.4%\nGAAP general and administrative expense $28,319 $25,453 $55,110 $49,436\nLess:\nStock-based compensation expense 7,404 6,139 14,441 11,705\nEmployer taxes related to stock-based\n143 65 440 155\ncompensation expense\n1% Pledge charitable contribution expense 1,347 964 1,347 964\nAcquisition related expense - 678 - 1,946\nAmortization of intangibles expense 140 148 358 148\nRestructuring expense - 103 - 103\nContingent consideration adjustment - - (137) -\nNon-GAAP general and administrative $19,285 $17,356 $38,661 $34,415\n15\n($23,456.00)\n($23,456.00)\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nDOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss)\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended Three Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31, July 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss attributable to Braze, Inc.

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans\nand objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-\nlooking statements because they contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,”\n“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would,” or the negative of\nthese words or other similar terms or expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements\nconcerning the following:\n• the anticipated effects of unstable market and economic conditions that may have serious adverse consequences on our\nbusiness, financial condition and share price;\n• our expectations regarding our revenue and the timing of revenue recognition under our customer contracts, expenses\nand other operating results;\n• our ability to acquire new customers and successfully retain existing customers;\n• our ability to increase usage of our platform and upsell and cross-sell additional products;\n• our ability to achieve or sustain our profitability;\n• future investments in our business, our anticipated capital expenditures and our estimates regarding our capital\nrequirements;\n• the costs and success of our marketing efforts, and our ability to promote our brand;\n• our reliance on key personnel and our ability to identify, recruit and retain skilled personnel;\n• our growth strategies for our platform and our ability to effectively manage our growth, including any international\nexpansion;\n• the estimated addressable market opportunity for our platform;\n• our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and any costs associated therewith;\n• the anticipated impact of domestic and global socioeconomic events on our business;\n• our ability to compete effectively with existing competitors and new market entrants;\n• the size and growth rates of the markets in which we compete; and\n• the anticipated benefits or effects of any completed or future acquisitions or international expansion.\nYou should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking\nstatements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future\nevents and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The outcome of the events\ndescribed in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section titled\n“Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly\nchanging environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks\nand uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this report. The results, events and\ncircumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or\ncircumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject.\nThese statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are\ninherently uncertain. While we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may\nbe limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or\nreview of, all relevant information.\nThe forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on\nwhich the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new\ninformation or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans,\nintentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-\nlooking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers,\ndispositions, joint ventures or investments.\nUnless the context otherwise indicates, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the terms “Braze,” “the\nCompany,” “we,” “our,” and “us,” refer to Braze, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nTrademarks\n“Braze,” “Be Absolutely Engaging,” and other trade names and trademarks of ours appearing in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q are our property.

Company Overview\nDescription of Business\nBraze, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Braze”), is a cloud-based\ncustomer engagement platform that delivers customer-centric experiences across push notifications, email, in-product\nmessaging, SMS and MMS messages, and more. Customers use the Braze platform to facilitate real-time experiences between\nbrands and customers in a more authentic and human way.\nWe began operations in 2011 and are incorporated in the state of Delaware. Our headquarters are located in New York\nCity. As of July 31, 2024, we also lease additional office space in over 10 cities across North America, South America, Europe,\nand Asia-Pacific.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The accompanying unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and\nvariable interest entities (“VIE”) for which we are the primary beneficiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications and immaterial changes have been made to prior-period financial statements to conform to the\ncurrent-period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported period. We evaluate estimates based\non historical and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions. Significant items subject to such estimates and\nassumptions include, but are not limited to, the standalone selling price for separate performance obligations in our revenue\narrangements, expected period of benefit for deferred contract costs, the valuation of common stock and stock-based\ncompensation, the allocation of overhead costs between cost of revenue and operating expenses, the estimated useful lives of\nintangible and depreciable assets, the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities from business combinations, valuation\nof long-lived assets and their recoverability, including goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate, the valuation of deferred tax\nassets and liabilities and other tax estimates including our ability to utilize net operating losses.\nManagement evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors,\nincluding the current economic environment, and makes adjustments as facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and\ntheir effects, including the uncertainty surrounding rapidly changing market and economic conditions from global or domestic\nmacroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions such as, among others, instability in the banking and financial services sector,\ninternational and domestic supply chain risks, inflationary pressure, interest rate increases, declines in consumer confidence,\ninternational conflicts and domestic and foreign political unrest, that impact us and our customers, cannot be determined with\nprecision, actual results could differ from those estimates and many of our estimates and assumptions have required increased\njudgement and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are detailed in “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the audited\nannual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 included in the Company’s Annual Report\non Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (the “Annual Report”). There have been no material changes to our\nsignificant accounting policies.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n12\nTable of Contents\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Restricted cash consists of letters of credit related to\nour leased properties. For cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities, we are exposed to credit risk in the\nevent of default by the financial institutions to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in excess\nof the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities\nbalances are maintained at financial institutions that management believes are of high-credit, quality financial institutions,\nwhere deposits, at times, exceed the FDIC limits.\nSignificant customers are those which represent 10% or more of our total revenue for the period, or accounts receivable\nat the balance sheets dates. For the three and six months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, no customer accounted for 10%\nor more of our total revenue.\nFor accounts receivable, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by customers to the extent of the\namounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. As of July 31, 2024, no customers accounted for 10% or more of our total\naccounts receivable balance. As of January 31, 2024, one customer accounted for approximately 11% of our accounts\nreceivable.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires\ndisclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), an\namount for other segment items with a description of the composition, and disclosure of the title and position of the CODM.\nASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the update should be applied retrospectively to each period\npresented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the consolidated\nfinancial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09 Income\nTaxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, (“ASU 2023-09”), which requires public business entities on an\nannual basis to disclose specific categories in a tabular rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling\nitems that meet a five percent quantitative threshold. Additionally, the ASU requires all entities to disclose the amount of\nincome taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, as well as individual jurisdictions where income taxes paid\nare equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the updated should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective\napplication permitted in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNo other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material\nimpact on the consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n13\nTable of Contents\n3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nDisaggregated Revenue Streams\nThe following disaggregation depicts the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows related to the primary\ntypes of revenue from contracts with customers.\nThe following table presents total revenue by type (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSubscription $ 139,960 $ 109,711 $ 270,108 $ 206,857\nProfessional services and other 5,539 5,396 10,850 10,030\nTotal $ 145,499 $ 115,107 $ 280,958 $ 216,887\nThe following table presents total revenue by geography (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnited States $ 80,233 $ 65,114 $ 155,872 $ 123,617\nInternational 65,266 49,993 125,086 93,270\nTotal $ 145,499 $ 115,107 $ 280,958 $ 216,887\nRevenue by geography is determined based on the location of our users. Other than the United States, no other individual\ncountry accounted for 10% or more of total revenue for any of the periods presented.\nUnbilled Accounts Receivable\nUnbilled accounts receivable included in trade accounts receivable, net, which generally arise from our contractual right\nto bill our customers in advance of services on the contract effective date, were $1.1 million and $1.5 million as of July 31,\n2024 and January 31, 2024, respectively.\nContract Balances\nContract Assets\nContract assets as of July 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024 were $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The change in\ncontract assets for all periods presented primarily reflects revenue recognized in excess of billings partially offset by contract\nassets earned during the period.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe change in deferred revenue for all periods presented primarily reflects cash payments received during the period for\nwhich the performance obligation was not satisfied prior to the end of the period, partially offset by revenues recognized during\nthe period. Revenue recognized during the three and six months ended July 31, 2024 from amounts included in deferred\nrevenue at January 31, 2024, was $59.9 million and $158.3 million, respectively. Revenue recognized during the three and six\nmonths ended July 31, 2023 from amounts included in deferred revenue at January 31, 2023, was $51.1 million and $128.2\nmillion, respectively.\n14\nTable of Contents\nCredit Losses\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable (in thousands):\nAllowance for\nCredit Losses\nBalance at January 31, 2024 $ 2,772\nReserve:\nCredit losses 369\nDeferred revenue 1,659\nWrite-offs (2,304)\nRecoveries 190\nBalance at July 31, 2024 $ 2,686\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents amounts under non-cancelable contracts\nexpected to be recognized as revenue in future periods, and may be influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the\ntiming of renewals, the timing of service delivery and contract terms. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance\nobligations are subject to future economic risks including bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors.\nThe following table presents remaining performance obligations as of the dates indicated below (in millions):\nLess than 1\nTotal Year 1-5 Years\nJuly 31, 2023 $ 523.5 $ 353.3 $ 170.2\nOctober 31, 2023 560.1 369.9 190.2\nJanuary 31, 2024 639.2 409.1 230.1\nApril 30, 2024 657.3 419.8 237.5\nJuly 31, 2024 689.6 438.3 251.3\n4. Variable Interest Entity and Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest\nOn September 14, 2020, we, along with Japan Cloud Computing Co., Ltd., and M30 LLC, (the “Investors”), entered into\nan agreement, whereby each Investor agreed to purchase shares of common stock of Braze Kabushiki Kaisha (“Braze KK” and\n“Braze KK Shares”) for a total purchase price of $10.0 million in two tranches of $5.0 million per tranche in September 2020\nand September 2021, to engage in the investment, organization, management and operation of Braze KK focused on the\ndistribution of our products in Japan. The purpose of this arrangement was to further expand our business in the Japanese\nmarket.\nIn March 2022, we consented to the periodic issuance of stock options to purchase Braze KK Shares by certain\nemployees of Braze KK. These options cannot be exercised by the holders thereof prior to the exercise of the call or put options\ndescribed in more detail below. The Company considers the stock options to be a substantive class of equity, classified as a\nliability within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. As of July 31, 2024, the liability balance was $0.8\nmillion. The issuance of stock options does not impact our majority stake in Braze KK, as none of the vesting criteria of the\noptions were met as of the balance sheet date. The issuance of stock options did not result in a reconsideration event and\ntherefore Braze KK still met the criteria of a Variable Interest Entity as Braze KK did not have sufficient equity at risk to\nfinance their activities. As a result, we continue to operate Braze KK as a subsidiary, exposing us to business and foreign\nexchange risk. We consolidate Braze KK and present the results within the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements\nof operations, and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe common stock held by the Investors is callable by us or puttable by the Investors upon certain contingent events.\nShould the call or put option be exercised, the redemption value would be determined based on a prescribed formula derived\nfrom the discrete revenues of Braze KK and the Company and may be settled, at our discretion, with our stock or cash. The\nnon-controlling interest in Braze KK is classified in mezzanine equity as redeemable non-controlling interest as a result of the\nput right available to the Investors in the future, an event that is not solely in our control. The non-controlling interest is not\naccreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that the non-controlling interest will become redeemable.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the redeemable non-controlling interests for the periods indicated below (in\nthousands):\nBalance as of January 31, 2024 $ 192\nNet loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest (216)\nBalance as of July 31, 2024 $ (24)\n5.

In determining\nthe value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such\ninvestments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various\nrelationships between investments.\nThe fair value of our contingent consideration is estimated using Level 3 unobservable inputs. The estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are uncertain, and involve significant judgments by\nmanagement. We will reassess the fair value of the contingent consideration quarterly until the contingency is resolved. The\nliability is recorded within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value are recorded\nin operating income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThere were no transfers of financial instruments among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the periods presented.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value changes in the contingent consideration liability in connection with the\nacquisition of North Star Y, Pty Ltd (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning fair value $ 86 $ — $ 223 $ —\nAdditions/adjustments in the period — 1,593 (137) 1,593\nEnding fair value $ 86 $ 1,593 $ 86 $ 1,593\n6.

This policy is designed to minimize the Company's\nexposure to credit losses. As of July 31, 2024, the credit-quality of the Company’s marketable available-for-sale debt securities\nhad remained stable. The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale debt securities as of July 31, 2024 was\nprimarily related to the continued market volatility associated with market expectations of an aggressive pace of interest rate\nincreases by the Federal Reserve. The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a\nprice less than the amortized cost basis of the investments and it is not expected that the investments would be settled at a price\nless than their amortized cost basis. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that\nthe Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The Company is not aware\nof any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to change its assessment of credit losses for any\nmarketable available-for-sale debt security as of July 31, 2024.

Stockholders’ Equity\nClass A and Class B Common Stock\nThe Company has two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. The rights of the holders of Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, conversion and transfer rights. Each share of Class\nA common stock is entitled to one vote. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes and may be converted at\nthe option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock. In addition, all shares of Class B common stock will\nautomatically convert into shares of Class A common stock in certain circumstances, including on the earlier of (i) the last\ntrading day of the fiscal quarter during which the number of shares of Class B common stock then outstanding represents less\nthan 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, or (ii) the\nlast trading day of the fiscal quarter immediately following the fifth anniversary of the initial public offering. All shares of the\nCompany’s capital stock outstanding immediately prior to our initial public offering, including all shares held by its executive\nofficers, directors and their respective affiliates, and all shares issuable upon the conversion of our then outstanding convertible\npreferred stock, were reclassified into shares of Class B common stock immediately prior to the completion of the initial public\noffering.\nCharitable Contributions\nIn connection with our Pledge 1% commitment, we donated 32,155 and 32,155 and shares of our Class A common stock\nto a charitable donor-advised fund that resulted in the recognition of $1.3 million and $1.0 million of expense within general\n20\nTable of Contents\nand administrative in the consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nWe donated 32,155 and 32,155 shares of our Class A common stock that resulted in the recognition of $1.3 million and\n$1.0 million of expense within general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations during the six months\nended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n12.

The terms of each award and the exercise price of awards under the\n2011 Plan are determined by our board of directors. Following effectiveness of the 2021 Plan in connection with our initial\npublic offering, no further awards were made under the 2011 Plan.\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2021, our board of directors and our stockholders approved the 2021 Plan, which became effective on\nNovember 16, 2021. No grants were made under the 2021 Plan prior to its effectiveness. No further grants will be made under\nthe 2011 Plan. At effectiveness, we reserved 25,660,249 shares of our Class A common stock to be issued under the 2021 Plan.\nIn addition, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan will automatically\nincrease on February 1 of each year for a period of ten years, beginning on February 1, 2022 and continuing through February\n1, 2031, in an amount equal to (1) 5% of the total number of shares of our common stock (both Class A and Class B)\noutstanding on the preceding January 31, or (2) a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors no later than the\nFebruary 1 increase. On February 1, 2024, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our\n2021 Plan increased by an additional 5,010,520 shares.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes unvested RSU award activity and related information:\nWeighted-\nAverage Grant\nShares Date Fair Value\nBalance as of January 31, 2024 6,263,739\nGranted 2,044,022 $ 50.94\nVested (1,164,367) $ 38.50\nForfeited (291,373) $ 38.10\nBalance as of July 31, 2024 6,852,021\nRSUs granted during the six months ended July 31, 2024 contained a service-based vesting condition of up to\napproximately a four year period.

Following completion of our initial public offering, the ESPP\nauthorized the issuance of 1,825,000 shares of our Class A common stock under purchase rights granted to our employees or to\nemployees of any of our designated affiliates. The number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance will\nautomatically increase on February 1 of each year for a period of ten years, beginning on February 1, 2022 and continuing\nthrough February 1, 2031, by the lesser of (i) 1% of the total number of shares of our common stock (both Class A and Class B)\noutstanding on the preceding January 31; and (ii) 2,737,000 shares, except before the date of any such increase, our board of\ndirectors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. On February 1,\n2024, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our ESPP increased by an additional\n1,002,104 shares.\nThe ESPP is implemented through a series of offerings under which eligible employees are granted purchase rights to\npurchase shares of the Company’s Class A common stock on specified dates during such offerings. Under the ESPP, our board\nof directors will be permitted to specify offerings with durations of not more than 27 months, and may specify shorter purchase\nperiods within each offering. Each offering will have one or more purchase dates on which shares of our Class A common stock\nwill be purchased for employees participating in the offering. On each purchase date, eligible employees will purchase the\nshares at a price per share equal to 85% of the lesser of (1) the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock on\nthe first trading day of the offering period or (2) the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the last day\nof the offering period, as defined by the ESPP.\nThe Company recognized $0.5 million and $0.6 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP in the\nthree months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.3 million and $1.4 million during the six months ended July\n31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAs of July 31, 2024, $1.2 million has been withheld on behalf of our employees for a future purchase and is classified as\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, the Company issued 148,914 shares of Class A common stock under the\nESPP. As of July 31, 2024, 4,208,260 shares of Class A common stock remain available for issuance under the ESPP.\n13. Commitments and Contingencies\nIndirect Taxes\nWe are subject to indirect taxation in some, but not all, of the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we\nconduct business. Therefore, we have an obligation to charge, collect and remit Value Added Tax (“VAT”) or Goods and\nServices Tax (“GST”) in connection with certain of our foreign sales transactions and sales and use tax in connection with\n22\nTable of Contents\neligible sales to subscribers in certain U.S. states. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in South Dakota\nv. Wayfair. The State of South Dakota alleged that U.S. constitutional law should be revised to permit South Dakota to require\nremote sellers to collect and remit sales tax in South Dakota in accordance with South Dakota’s sales tax statute. Under the U.S.\nSupreme Court’s ruling, the longstanding Quill Corp v. North Dakota sales tax case was overruled, and states may now require\nremote sellers to collect sales tax under certain circumstances. We began collecting sales tax in relevant jurisdictions for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2019. As a result of this ruling and given the scope of our operations, taxing authorities continue\nto provide regulations that increase the complexity and risks to comply with such laws and could result in substantial liabilities,\nprospectively as well as retrospectively. Based on the information available, we continue to evaluate and assess the jurisdictions\nin which indirect tax nexus exists and believe that the indirect tax liabilities are adequate and reasonable. Due to the complexity\nand uncertainty around the application of these rules by taxing authorities, results may vary materially from expectations, and\nwe have recognized liabilities for contingencies related to state sales and use tax, VAT, and GST deemed probable and\nestimable totaling $1.5 million and $1.0 million as of July 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, respectively, which is included in\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. As of January 31, 2024, we have filed prior\nperiod returns in several jurisdictions in order to remediate this potential exposure, and the Company continues to evaluate the\npotential exposure on an ongoing basis.\nLegal Contingencies\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we are or may be involved in various legal or regulatory\nproceedings, claims or purported class actions related to, among other things, alleged infringement of third-party patents and\nother intellectual property rights, commercial, labor and employment, wage and hour and other claims. We have been, and may\nin the future be, put on notice or sued by third-parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent\ninfringement. We accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of\nloss can be reasonably estimated. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of July 31,\n2024, we believe that no material loss will be incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.\n14. Leases\nLeases\nThe Company’s lease portfolio consists solely of office space with lease terms ranging from approximately one to ten\nyears. Certain lease agreements include options to renew or terminate the lease, which are not reasonably certain to be exercised\nand therefore are not factored into the determination of lease payments.\nThe components of lease cost reflected on the consolidated statements of operations were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease cost $ 4,295 $ 3,862 $ 9,836 $ 7,513\nVariable lease cost 60 778 870 1,450\nShort-term lease cost 129 97 231 385\nTotal net lease cost $ 4,484 $ 4,737 $ 10,937 $ 9,348\nThe future maturities of the Company’s operating lease liabilities by fiscal year are as follows (in thousands):\nAmount\nRemainder of 2025 $ 8,226\n2026 16,356\n2027 15,506\n2028 13,210\n2029 12,652\nThereafter 51,302\nTotal future undiscounted lease payments $ 117,252\nLess: imputed interest (29,365)\nTotal reported lease liability $ 87,887\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe Company's lease terms and discount rates are as follows:\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years) 7.9 6.2\nWeighted-average discount rate 7.3 % 5.6 %\nOther information for the Company's leases is as follows (in thousands):\nSix Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 7,381 $ 5,788\nOperating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 1,837 $ 1,524\nSydney Lease Agreement\nIn May 2024, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a new office space in Sydney, Australia. The lease\ncommencement date, which is when the premises will become available to the Company for use, is expected to be in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. The Company is obligated to pay $0.1 million per month beginning in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 through the third quarter of fiscal 2030, the expiration date.\n15. Income Taxes\nThe Company computes its provision for interim periods by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to anticipated\nannual pretax income or loss as directed by ASC 740. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the Company’s year\nto date income or loss, and is adjusted for discrete items recorded in the period. The Company recorded an income tax expense\nof $0.7 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the\nthree months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 was (3.1)% and (1.7)%, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax\nprovision of $1.5 million and $0.9 million for the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate\nfor the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 was (2.6)% and (1.3)%, respectively.\nThe provision for income taxes recorded for the three and six months ended July 31, 2024 consists of income taxes in\nstate jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business. The primary difference between the\neffective tax rate and the statutory rate is the change in the valuation allowance recorded. The Company continues to maintain a\nfull valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the\ndeferred tax assets will be realized. When the Company determines that it will be able to realize some portion or all of its\ndeferred tax assets, an adjustment to its valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets would have the effect of increasing net\nincome in the period such determination is made.\n16. Net Loss per Share\nWe compute the basic and diluted net loss per share of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The\nrights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are substantially\n24\nTable of Contents\nidentical, other than voting rights.

We have\npurchased services from Datadog, Inc. in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.4 million and $0.4 million during the three\nmonths ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.8 million and $1.2 million during the six months ended July 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\n18. Restructuring\nIn May 2023, the Company implemented a workforce reduction designed to rebalance talent to better meet customer\nneeds and achieve business priorities. No restructuring costs were recognized during the three months ended July 31, 2024.\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2023, $0.6 million of restructuring costs were recognized.\n19. Business Combination\nAcquisition of North Star Y, Pty Ltd\nOn June 1, 2023, the Company acquired all the outstanding stock of North Star Y, Pty Ltd (“North Star”), Braze’s then\nexclusive reseller in Australia and New Zealand. The transaction provides Braze with a direct market presence in Australia and\nNew Zealand, along with local market expertise from the North Star team.\nThe total purchase price consideration, as adjusted, of $26.9 million consisted of cash payments of $17.6 million, $6.1\nmillion in issuances of Braze Class A common stock, and contingent consideration payments, the fair value of which was $1.8\nmillion as of the acquisition date. The sellers are eligible to receive cash earn-out payments calculated based on qualified\n25\nTable of Contents\nrevenue performance metrics for the two individual twelve month periods immediately subsequent to the closing of the\nacquisition. The earn-out payments are capped at $10.0 million for the first earn-out period and $16.0 million for the second\nearn-out period. The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability has been influenced by developments in\nthe significant inputs for such calculation, notably the new and incremental actual and forecasted deal closings from the\nAustralia-New Zealand region. As a result, during the quarter ended July 31, 2024, the Company maintains the contingent\nconsideration liability of $0.1 million which represents the liability for the second earn-out period.\nThe preliminary purchase price, as adjusted, was allocated to intangible assets in the amount of $3.8 million and\ngoodwill in the amount of $28.4 million based on the respective estimated fair values. The resulting goodwill is not deductible\nfor income tax purposes.\nAn indemnification holdback of $2.8 million that was previously recorded within accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets was extinguished in the three months ended April 30, 2024. The indemnification\nholdback represents security for potential indemnification claims against the seller. The indemnification holdback was released\nin full.\nOf the initial $0.5 million working capital holdback, $0.3 million has been released based on the completion of post-\nclose adjustment procedures.\nThe results of operations of North Star, which were not material, have been included in the Company’s consolidated\nstatements of operations for the six months ended July 31, 2024.\n20.

Subsequent Events\nIn August 2024, in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment, the Company donated 32,155 shares of Class A\ncommon stock to a charitable donor-advised fund that resulted in the recognition of approximately $1.4 million of operating\nexpense.\nIn August 2024, the Company granted RSUs for a total of 225,121 shares of Class A common stock to employees\npursuant to the 2021 Plan. The RSUs vest over a service period of approximately four years. The grant date fair value of these\nawards was $9.7 million.\n27\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction\nwith our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q and our audited annual consolidated financial statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2024 that are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, or the Annual Report, filed with the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on April 1, 2024. In addition to historical financial information, the following\ndiscussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks\nand uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a\nresult of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of\nPart II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nBraze is a leading customer engagement platform that empowers brands to Be Absolutely Engaging™. Our platform\nempowers brands to listen to their customers better, understand them more deeply, and act on that understanding in a way that\nis human and personal. Using our platform, brands ingest and process customer data in real time, orchestrate and optimize\ncontextually relevant, marketing campaigns across multiple channels. Our platform is designed so that interactions between\nbrands and consumers have the same relevance and cross-channel continuity as human interactions.\nOur customers include many established global enterprises and leading technology innovators, and span a wide variety of\nsizes and industries, including retail and consumer goods, media and entertainment, restaurants and on-demand healthcare and\nlife sciences, financial services, travel, transportation, and hospitality.\nWe primarily generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to customers for the use of our platform. Our subscription\nfees are principally based on an upfront commitment by our customers for messaging volumes, a specific number of monthly\nactive users, platform access and/or support and certain add-on products. Additionally, we provide professional services, which\nbetter enable customers to successfully onboard and use our platform, including certain premium professional services such as\nemail deliverability support and dedicated technical support staff.\nWe employ a land-and-expand business model centered around offering products that are easy to adopt and have a rapid\ntime to value. We expand our reach within existing customers when our customers add new channels, purchase additional\nsubscription products, implement new engagement strategies, or onboard new business units and geographies. We also grow as\nour customers grow because our pricing is based in large part on the number of consumers that our customers reach and the\nvolume of messages our customers send. Accordingly, as our customers increase the use of our platform and increase the\nnumber of end users reached via our platform, the value of our contracts with such customers also increases.\nWe have grown significantly in recent periods. We generated revenue of $145.5 million and $115.1 million in the three\nmonths ended July 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 26.4%, and $281.0 million and\n$216.9 million in the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had net losses of $23.1 million and $32.0\nmillion in the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $58.9 million and $70.9 million in the six months\nended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $31.0 million in the six months\nended July 31, 2024 and net cash provided by operating activities of $5.0 million in the six months ended July 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Our Non-GAAP free cash flow was $18.7 million and $3.0 million in the six months ended July 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. See the section titled “— Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow” for additional information about how we calculate\nfree cash flow, a non-GAAP financial metric, and a reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly\ncomparable measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S.\nGAAP.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe believe there is substantial opportunity to continue to grow our customer base. We intend to continue to expand our\ncustomer base in verticals where we already have a strong presence, such as retail, media and entertainment, on-demand\nservices, gaming, health and lifestyle, and financial services — and to increase our presence in verticals where we are not yet\nstrongly represented. Through our sales and marketing efforts, we also plan to capitalize on industries subject to ongoing digital\ntransformation and where direct-to-consumer relationships are accelerating, to further propel adoption of our technology. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, we had 2,163 customers across a broad range of sizes and industries. Our ability to attract new customers will\ndepend on a number of factors, including the quality and pricing of our products, offerings of our competitors and the\neffectiveness of our marketing efforts.\n28\nTable of Contents\nWe define a customer as the separate and distinct, ultimate parent-level entity that has an active subscription with us to\nuse our products. A single organization could have multiple distinct contracting divisions or subsidiaries, all of which together\nwould be considered a single customer.\nExpanding Within Our Existing Customer Base\nWe believe we can achieve significant growth by expanding sales within our existing customer base. We expand the use\nof our platform by existing customers by, among others, adding new channels and increasing the messaging volume we sell to\nour customers as their businesses and needs continue to grow and as they connect directly with additional consumers, which in\nturn leads to a need for greater messaging capacity. We intend to continue to invest in developing and enhancing our products\nand functionality. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including our\ncustomers’ satisfaction with our solutions, the ability of our customers to attract new end users, competition, pricing and overall\nchanges in our customers’ spending levels.\nHistorically, we have experienced significant expansion within a customer’s business once our platform is deployed,\nwith customers typically increasing the number of monthly active users, channels and use cases, as well as purchasing\nadditional products. A monthly active user is an end user of a customer who has engaged with the customer’s applications and\nwebsites in the previous thirty-day period. We include each distinguishable end user in our calculation of monthly active users,\neven though some users may access our customers’ applications and websites using more than one device, and multiple users\nmay gain access using the same device. As of July 31, 2024, we had approximately 6.7 billion monthly active users, up from\napproximately 6.2 billion monthly active users as of January 31, 2024.\nBraze supports interactions across a broad range of both in-product and out-of-product messaging channels. The\nflexibility of our platform also allows us to add new channels quickly and efficiently as they become relevant to our customers.\nThe breadth of channels we offer, and our ability to efficiently expand our offering of channels, allows us to expand our reach\nwithin existing customers as they purchase additional channels from us.\nIn addition to monthly active users, we have a history of increasing annual recurring revenue, or ARR, from our\ncustomers. We define ARR as the annualized value of customer subscription contracts, including certain premium professional\nservices that are subject to contractual subscription terms, as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires\nduring the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms (including contracts for which we are negotiating a renewal). Our\ncalculation of ARR is not adjusted for the impact of any known or projected future events (such as customer cancellations,\nexpansion or contraction of existing customers relationships or price increases or decreases) that may cause any such contract\nnot to be renewed on its existing terms. Our ARR may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including\ncustomers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our products and professional services, pricing, competitive offerings, economic\nconditions or overall changes in our customers’ spending levels. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and does not\nrepresent our GAAP revenue on an annualized basis or a forecast of revenue, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted\nby contract start and end dates and renewal rates.\nFor clarity, we use annualized invoiced amounts per customer subscription contract, including certain premium\nprofessional services that are subject to contractual subscription terms, as compared to revenue calculated in accordance with\nGAAP, to calculate our ARR. Our invoiced amounts are not matched to the performance obligations associated with the\nunderlying subscription contract and premium professional service obligations as they are with respect to our GAAP revenue.\nThis can result in timing differences between our GAAP revenue and ARR calculations. For our revenue calculated in\naccordance with GAAP, we recognize revenue related to contracts with customers in an amount that reflects the consideration\nto which we expect to be entitled in exchange for subscription and professional services. See the section titled “— Critical\nAccounting Policies and Estimates” and the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” contained in our Annual Report for additional information regarding how we recognize revenue on a\nGAAP basis. Investors should not place undue reliance on ARR as an indicator of our future or expected results. Moreover,\nARR may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies and may not be comparable to such other metrics.\nA further indication of the propensity of our customer relationships to expand over time is our dollar-based net retention\nrate. We calculate our dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all\ncustomers as of 12 months prior to such period-end, or the Prior Period ARR. We then calculate the ARR from these same\ncustomers as of the current period-end, or the Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of\ncontraction or attrition over the last 12 months but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide the\ntotal Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the point-in-time dollar-based net retention rate. We then\ncalculate the weighted average point-in-time dollar-based net retention rates as of the last day of each month in the current\ntrailing 12-month period to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. Our dollar-based net retention rate for the trailing 12\nmonths ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023 was 114% and 120%, respectively, for all our customers, and 117% and 123%,\n29\nTable of Contents\nrespectively, for our customers with ARR of $500,000 or more. In addition, 222 and 173 of our customers had ARR of\n$500,000 or more as of July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, respectively.\nExpanding Geographically\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand our presence in international markets we have already\npenetrated and by entering markets we have not yet penetrated. For the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023,\napproximately 45% and 43% of our revenue was generated outside of the United States, respectively. We expect to increase\nmarket penetration in regions including Europe and Asia-Pacific and to further capitalize on the greenfield opportunity in\nregions such as Latin America. Although these investments in geographic regions may negatively affect our operating results in\nthe near term, we believe that they will contribute to our long-term growth.\nSustaining Innovation and Technology Leadership\nOur success is dependent on our ability to sustain innovation and technology leadership in order to maintain our\ncompetitive advantage. We are focused on investing in research and development to continue to enhance our platform. For\nexample, we continue to develop our artificial intelligence capabilities, to enable brands to better analyze and act on customer\ndata, and to expand our channel offerings. We believe our market-driven product development approach maximizes the return\non new feature development and channel expansion. Our customers consistently volunteer to participate in the testing of new\nproducts, which indicates their appetite for new and innovative functionality. We believe our continued innovation will provide\nnew avenues for growth through which we will continue to deliver differentiated outcomes for our customers. We intend to\ncontinue to invest in building additional products that expand our capabilities and facilitate the extension of our platform to new\nchannels and use cases.\nMacroeconomic Conditions on Our Business\nUnfavorable conditions in the economy, both in the United States and abroad, may negatively affect the growth of our\nbusiness and our results of operations. General macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions such as, among others, instability\nin the banking and financial services sector, international and domestic supply chain risks, inflationary pressure, interest rate\nincreases, declines in consumer confidence, international conflicts and domestic and foreign political unrest have led to\nincreased economic uncertainty. We cannot predict if these trends will continue, and, accordingly, we are not able to estimate\nthe ongoing effects on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity as a result of these macroeconomic factors. For\nadditional details, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nRevenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) subscription services and (2) professional services and other.\nSubscription services primarily consist of access to our customer engagement platform and related customer support. Our\ncustomers enter into a subscription for committed contractual entitlements. To the extent that our customers’ usage exceeds the\ncommitted contractual entitlements under their subscription plans, they are charged for excess usage, or they may exercise an\noption to purchase an incremental volume tier of committed contractual entitlements. Revenue associated with platform\nsubscriptions is recognized ratably over the contract term, which is consistent with the period over which services are provided\nto the customer. Fees associated with excess usage and incremental volume are also treated as subscription revenue. To date,\nfees associated with excess usage have not been material.\nProfessional services and other revenue consists of fees for distinct services rendered in training and assisting our\ncustomers to configure our platform for their use at the onset of their initial contract or when a new product is purchased. Such\nrevenue is generally recognized over a period of up to six months from providing access to the platform. We also provide\nadditional platform and feature enhancement and optimization services which are generally recognized ratably over the contract\nterm.\nDeferred revenue consists of customer billings in advance of revenue being recognized. We generally invoice our\ncustomers for subscription services arrangements annually in advance and for professional services upfront.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of direct costs related to providing platform access to our customers and to performing\nonboarding and professional services including consulting services. These costs primarily include payments to third-party cloud\n30\nTable of Contents\ninfrastructure providers for hosting software solutions, costs associated with application service providers utilized to deliver the\nplatform, personnel-related costs, including salaries, cash-based performance compensation, benefits and stock-based\ncompensation, and overhead cost allocations, including rent, utilities, depreciation, information technology costs, amortization\nof internal use software and certain administrative personnel costs.\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure and our customer support and success\norganizations to expand the capabilities of our platform. The level, timing and relative investment in our infrastructure could\naffect our cost of revenue in the future. We expect our cost of revenue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to\ngrow our business.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue.\nOur gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue and cost of revenue fluctuates, including as a result of the\ntiming and amount of resources we dedicate to improving our platform and expanding our products.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative\nexpenses. Personnel costs, including salaries, cash-based performance compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation,\nare the most significant component of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs, which\ninclude rent, utilities, depreciation, information technology costs and certain administrative personnel costs. As we continue to\nexpand our operations, we expect an increase in personnel headcount and expansion of our global footprint.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing organization, sales\ncommissions, costs related to brand awareness, sponsorships, customer marketing events and advertising, agency costs, travel-\nrelated expenses and allocated overhead costs.\nWe intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to help drive the growth of our business. We expect our sales and\nmarketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales and marketing activities to acquire new\ncustomers and increase sales to existing customers.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our engineering, service, design and\ninformation technology teams. Additionally, research and development expenses include allocated overhead costs and\ncontractor fees. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized internal-use software development costs\nare excluded from research and development expenses as they are capitalized as a component of property and equipment, net\nand amortized to cost of revenue over the software’s expected useful life, which is generally three years.\nWe expect to continue our investment in research and development to enhance the user experience of our current\ncustomers and attract new customers. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we\ncontinue to invest in enhancing our platform.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance, legal, human resources and other\nadministrative functions, as well as non-personnel costs such as legal, accounting and other professional service fees, software\ncosts, certain tax, license and insurance-related expenses and allocated overhead costs. Additionally, from time to time general\nand administrative expenses may include expenses associated with our donation of shares of Class A common stock to a\ncharitable donor-advised fund in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment.\nWe expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and vary from period to period as a\npercentage of revenue for the foreseeable future but decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term, as we focus on\nprocesses, systems, and controls to enable our internal support functions to scale with the growth of our business. We have\nincurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses\nto comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, expenses related to\ncompliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and higher expenses for insurance,\ninvestor relations and professional services.\n31\nTable of Contents\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net, primarily consists of net exchange gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and investment\nincome consists primarily of income earned on our investments, cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we\nconduct business.

Total customers grew to 2,163 as of July 31, 2024 from 1,958 as of July 31, 2023.\nProfessional services revenue increased $0.1 million, or 2.7%, due to an increase in deliverability services, technical account\nmanagement, and support engagement services. These increases were partially offset by the decline in onboarding revenue as a\nresult of the continued engagement of new customers with third-party partner-led onboarding. Additionally, in the three months\nended July 31, 2024, our international revenue increased by $15.3 million as we continued to expand market penetration in\nregions such as Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 43,420 $ 35,474 $ 7,946 22.4 %\nGross profit $ 102,079 $ 79,633 $ 22,446 28.2 %\nGross margin 70.2 % 69.2 %\nThe increase in cost of revenue of $7.9 million, or 22.4%, for the three months ended July 31, 2024, compared to the\nthree months ended July 31, 2023, was primarily driven by an increase of $1.1 million in hosting, infrastructure, and other\nthird-party fees associated with delivering our platform and a $5.7 million increase in third-party messaging fees associated\nwith growth in premium messaging channels. In addition, we had an increase in personnel costs and overhead costs of $0.9\nmillion. The increased infrastructure, messaging, and personnel costs were incurred to support overall revenue growth.\n33\nTable of Contents\nOur gross profit increased $22.4 million, or 28.2%, in the three months ended July 31, 2024, compared to the three\nmonths ended July 31, 2023, and our gross margin increased 1.0% to 70.2% in the three months ended July 31, 2024 from\n69.2% in the three months ended July 31, 2023. These margin increases were due primarily to improved personnel efficiencies,\neconomies of scale, and the optimization of costs of our tech stack as our infrastructure costs to support our revenue growth did\nnot increase at the same pace as our revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expense\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nSales and marketing $ 68,569 $ 60,417 $ 8,152 13.5 %\nThe increase in sales and marketing expense of $8.2 million, or 13.5%, for the three months ended July 31, 2024,\ncompared to the three months ended July 31, 2023, was primarily driven by an increase in personnel costs and overhead costs\nof $5.2 million, which included $2.1 million of stock-based compensation costs. Additionally, the increase was driven in part\nby an increase of $1.5 million in promotional and product marketing, primarily related to the hosting of regional customer\nevents and sales related events, and an increase of $1.0 million in software costs.\nResearch and Development Expense\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nResearch and development $ 33,141 $ 29,132 $ 4,009 13.8 %\nThe increase in research and development expense of $4.0 million or 13.8%, for the three months ended July 31, 2024,\ncompared to the three months ended July 31, 2023, was primarily driven by an increase of personnel and overhead costs of $3.7\nmillion, which included $1.5 million of stock-based compensation costs. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to a\nperiod-over-period increase in headcount to support our continued investment in the features and functionality of our platform.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nGeneral and administrative $ 28,319 $ 25,453 $ 2,866 11.3 %\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses of $2.9 million, or 11.3%, for the three months ended July 31, 2024,\ncompared to the three months ended July 31, 2023, was primarily driven by an increase of personnel and overhead costs of $3.1\nmillion, which included $1.3 million of stock-based compensation costs. The increases were primarily due to investments in our\nfinance and administrative functions to continue to scale our processes, systems, and controls, to enable our ongoing\ncompliance with public company legal and regulatory requirements. The increases in expenses were partially offset by a\ndecrease in software costs of $0.4 million.\nOther Income, Net\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nOther income, net $ 5,503 $ 3,865 $ 1,638 42.4 %\nThe increase in other income, net of $1.6 million, or 42.4%, for the three months ended July 31, 2024, compared to the\nthree months ended July 31, 2023, was attributable to a $1.5 million increase in investment income from marketable securities.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe investment income increase was driven primarily by the graded maturation of the portfolio positions at higher interest rates\nand the reinvestment of proceeds in a high interest rate environment.\nComparison of the Six Months Ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023\nRevenue\nSix Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nRevenue $ 280,958 $ 216,887 $ 64,071 29.5 %\nThe increase in revenue of $64.1 million, or 29.5%, for the six months ended July 31, 2024, compared to the six months\nended July 31, 2023, was primarily driven by a $63.3 million, or 30.6%, increase in subscription revenue. Approximately\n60.0% of the increase in subscription revenue was attributable to the growth from existing customers, increase in monthly\nactive users, expansion across channels, and committed entitlements and features, and the remaining 40.0% was attributable to\nnew customers. Total customers grew to 2,163 as of July 31, 2024 from 1,958 as of July 31, 2023. Professional services\nrevenue increased $0.8 million, or 8.2%, due to an increase in deliverability services, technical account management, and\nsupport engagement services. These increases were partially offset by the decline in onboarding revenue as a result of the\ncontinued engagement of new customers with third-party partner-led onboarding. Additionally, in the six months ended July 31,\n2024, our international revenue increased by $31.8 million, as we continued to expand market penetration in regions such as\nEurope and Asia-Pacific.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nSix Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 87,968 $ 68,161 $ 19,807 29.1 %\nGross profit $ 192,990 $ 148,726 $ 44,264 29.8 %\nGross margin 68.7 % 68.6 %\nThe increase in cost of revenue of $19.8 million, or 29.1%, for the six months ended July 31, 2024, compared to the six\nmonths ended July 31, 2023, was primarily driven by an increase of $5.8 million in hosting, infrastructure and other third-party\nfees associated with delivering our platform and a $11.6 million increase in third-party messaging fees associated with growth\nin premium messaging channels. In addition, we had an increase in personnel costs and overhead costs of $1.8 million. The\nincreased infrastructure, messaging, and personnel costs were incurred to support overall revenue growth.\nOur gross profit increased $44.3 million, or 29.8%, in the six months ended July 31, 2024, compared to the six months\nended July 31, 2023, and our gross margin increased 0.1% to 68.7% in the six months ended July 31, 2024, compared to the six\nmonths ended July 31, 2023. These margin increases were due primarily to improved personnel efficiencies, economies of\nscale, and the optimization of costs of our tech stack as our infrastructure costs to support our revenue growth did not increase\nat the same pace as our revenue. These increases were partially offset by expenses associated with the continued adoption of\npremium messaging channels and a one-time charge to revenue related to our April service disruption.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expense\nSix Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nSales and marketing $ 138,396 $ 117,679 $ 20,717 17.6 %\nThe increase in sales and marketing expense of $20.7 million, or 17.6%, for the six months ended July 31, 2024,\ncompared to the six months ended July 31, 2023, was primarily driven by an increase in personnel costs and overhead costs of\n$12.1 million, which included $3.7 million of stock-based compensation costs, as a result of a period-over-period increase in\nheadcount. Additionally, the increase was primarily due to an increase in net amortization of deferred contract costs of $1.2\n35\nTable of Contents\nmillion as a result of sales growth, an increase of $1.6 million related to software costs, and an increase of $5.6 million in travel,\nentertainment, and marketing expenses primarily related to the hosting of regional customer events and sales related events.\nResearch and Development Expense\nSix Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nResearch and development $ 67,514 $ 58,877 $ 8,637 14.7 %\nThe increase in research and development expense of $8.6 million, or 14.7%, for the six months ended July 31, 2024,\ncompared to the six months ended July 31, 2023, was primarily driven by an increase of personnel and overhead costs of $7.7\nmillion, which included $2.5 million of stock-based compensation costs, and an increase in software costs of $0.7 million. The\nincrease in personnel costs and software costs were primarily due to a period-over-period increase in headcount to support out\ncontinued investment in the features and functionality of our platform.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nSix Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nGeneral and administrative $ 55,110 $ 49,436 $ 5,674 11.5 %\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses of $5.7 million, or 11.5%, for the six months ended July 31, 2024,\ncompared to the six months ended July 31, 2023, was primarily driven by an increase in personnel and overhead costs of $6.8\nmillion, which included $1.3 million of stock-based compensation costs.

Our cash and cash equivalents consist of deposit accounts, interest-bearing money market accounts, and U.S.\ngovernment securities that are stated at fair value. Our marketable securities positions consist mostly of highly liquid short-term\ninvestments. The investment income that we generate on these investments is not material to our overall cash balance, but may\nbe adversely affected due to volatility in interest rates.\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds received from the sales of\nequity securities and cash generated from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. We have generated losses from our\noperations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $541.7 million as of July 31, 2024, and cash flows provided by operating\nactivities for the six months ended July 31, 2024 of $31.0 million.\nA substantial source of our cash provided by operating activities is our deferred revenue, which is included on the\nconsolidated balance sheets as a liability. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions,\n36\nTable of Contents\nwhich is recorded as revenue over the term of the subscription agreement. As of July 31, 2024, we had total deferred revenue of\n$212.4 million, of which, $212.1 million was recorded as a current liability. Deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue\nwhen all of the revenue recognition criteria are met.\nCash Flow Overview\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nSix Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 31,007 $ 5,032\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (27,431) $ (3,488)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 4,041 $ 7,333\nOperating Activities\nFor the six months ended July 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $31.0 million, primarily due to a\nnet loss of $58.9 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $80.8 million, and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities\nof $9.1 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily relate to stock-based compensation of $58.8 million and amortization of\ndeferred contract costs of $17.0 million. The cash inflow from changes in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily due\nto a decrease in accounts receivable of $20.7 million and increase in deferred revenue of $7.8 million as a result of billings for\nnew bookings and renewals. The cash inflow was offset by cash outflows primarily from an increase in deferred contract costs\nof $22.0 million as a result of commissions on new bookings and renewals.\nFor the six months ended July 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 million, primarily due to a net\nloss of $70.9 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $70.0 million, and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of\n$5.9 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily relate to stock-based compensation of $49.0 million and amortization of\ndeferred contract costs of $13.9 million. The cash inflow from changes in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily due\nto a decrease in accounts receivable of $8.9 million and increase in deferred revenue of $6.5 million as a result of billings for\nnew bookings and renewals. The cash inflow was offset by cash outflows primarily from an increase in deferred contract costs\nof $21.0 million as a result of commissions on new bookings and renewals.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $27.4 million for the six months ended July 31, 2024, primarily consisting of\npurchases of marketable securities of $142.1 million, purchases of property and equipment of $10.2 million, and capitalization\nof internal-use software costs of $2.1 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of $127.0 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.5 million for the six months ended July 31, 2023, primarily consisting of\npurchases of marketable securities of $121.4 million, cash paid for the acquisition of North Star Y, Pty Ltd of $16.3 million,\nand capitalization of internal-use software costs of $1.6 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of\n$136.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $4.0 million for the six months ended July 31, 2024, primarily consisting\nof proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $2.2 million and proceeds from stock associated with employee\nstock purchase plan of $4.8 million, partially offset by payments of deferred purchase consideration of $2.9 million,\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $7.3 million for the six months ended July 31, 2023, consisting solely of\nproceeds from the exercise of common stock options.\nNon-GAAP Free Cash Flow\nWe report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements, we provide investors with the amount of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Our\nmanagement uses free cash flow to assess our operating performance and our progress towards our goal of positive free cash\nflow. We define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment\nand amounts capitalized for internal-use software development costs. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of\nliquidity as it measures our ability to generate cash, or our need to access additional sources of cash, to fund operations and\ninvestments.\nFree cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (1) it is not a substitute for net cash provided by/\n(used in) operating activities, (2) other companies may calculate free cash flow or similarly titled non-GAAP measures\n37\nTable of Contents\ndifferently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow\nas a tool for comparison, and (3) the utility of free cash flow is further limited as it does not reflect our future contractual\ncommitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for any given period.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, the\nmost directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented:\nSix Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 31,007 $ 5,032\nLess:\nPurchases of property and equipment (10,224) (427)\nCapitalized internal-use software costs (2,108) (1,640)\nNon-GAAP free cash flow $ 18,675 $ 2,965\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (27,431) $ (3,488)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 4,041 $ 7,333\nOur free cash flow increased for the six months ended July 31, 2024 from the six months ended July 31, 2023, primarily\ndue to higher collections as a result of an increase in billings that are aligned with new contracts and contract renewals. We\nexpect our free cash flow to fluctuate in future periods with changes in our operating expenses and as we continue to invest in\nour growth.\nLiquidity Outlook\nWe assess our liquidity primarily through our cash on hand as well as the projected timing of billings under contracts\nwith our paying customers and related collection cycles. While our future capital requirements will depend on many factors,\nincluding revenue growth and costs incurred to support customer usage and growth in our customer base, increased research\nand development expenses to support the growth of our business and related infrastructure, and increased general and\nadministrative expenses to support being a publicly-traded company, we believe our current cash, cash equivalents, and\nmarketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12\nmonths.\nOur most significant funding requirements are principally comprised of employee compensation and related taxes and\nbenefits, non-cancelable purchase commitments, and operating lease obligations. Non-cancelable purchase commitments for\nbusiness operations and operating lease obligations total $189.1 million and $117.8 million, respectively, as of July 31, 2024.\nPurchase commitments for business operations are predominately related to cloud hosting, infrastructure, and other software-\nbased services and due primarily over the next three years. Our future funding requirements to settle our obligations in foreign\njurisdictions are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign exchange rates.\nWhile we anticipate being able to satisfy our commitments through a combination of our available current cash, cash\nequivalents, and marketable securities, and cash generated from the sale of subscriptions to our platform, if our estimates prove\nto be inaccurate we may seek to sell additional equity or other securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders, issue\ndebt or seek other third-party funding, in order to satisfy our future funding requirements.\nSeasonality\nWe have experienced seasonality in our cost of revenue as a result of our customers’ increased usage of our platform\nbased on their business demands. We typically experience the highest sequential increase in overall messaging volume and\ncompute and storage requirements during the fourth quarter due to the increased activity related to the holiday season and\ngeneral customer engagement efforts around the end of the calendar year.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are\n38\nTable of Contents\nbased on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our\nactual results could differ from these estimates.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those previously reported and\ndisclosed in our Annual Report other than those referenced in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” contained in our Annual Report provides a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies\nand estimates.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, if\napplicable.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may\nimpact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily\nthe result of fluctuations in interest rates.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations,\nother than its impact on the general economy. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to inflationary pressures, we\nmight not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk and Market Risk\nWe had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $504.5 million as of July 31, 2024, of which $424.9 million\nwas invested in U.S. government securities, foreign securities, and corporate debt securities. Our cash and cash equivalents are\nheld for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our investments in marketable securities are made for capital\npreservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOur cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates.\nFixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities\nmay produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. As of July 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates\nwould not have had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Because we classify our debt securities as\n“available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to\nmaturity or unless declines in fair value are determined to be non-temporary.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nOur reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is\nprimarily the respective local currency. Substantially all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our only sales\ndenominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollars are our sales in Japan, which are denominated in Yen. Therefore, our\nrevenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies\nof the countries in which our operations are located, which are primarily the United States, United Kingdom, Singapore and\nJapan. The consolidated results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The assets and\nliabilities of each of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet\ndate. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a\nseparate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Gains or losses due to transactions in foreign\ncurrencies are included in interest and other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We have\nexperienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses related to changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. In the event our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, revenue, or expenses increase, our\nresults of operations may be more greatly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do\nbusiness. To date we have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions, although we may choose to do so in the\n39\nTable of Contents\nfuture. A hypothetical 10% change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies during any of the periods\npresented would not have had a material effect on our realized and unrealized gains (losses) on foreign exchange transactions.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information\nrequired to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\nDisclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable\nassurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of July 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective as of July 31, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under\nthe Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected,\nor is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are\nmet. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls\nmust be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls\ncan provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\n40\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business\nactivities. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are not presently a party to any litigation the outcome of\nwhich, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Defending such proceedings can be costly and can impose a\nsignificant burden on management and employees. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with\ncertainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources and other factors.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. You\nshould carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties\ndescribed below are not the only ones we face. Additional risk and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently\ndeem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following\nrisk factors is realized, our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of\nyour investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business operations are subject to numerous risks, factors and uncertainties, including those outside of our control,\nthat could cause our actual results to be harmed, including risks regarding the following:\n• Unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial\ncondition, and share price.\n• Our rapid revenue growth may not be indicative of our future revenue growth. Our rapid revenue growth also makes it\ndifficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\n• We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\n• We have a limited history operating at our current scale, and our future results of operations may fluctuate significantly\ndue to a wide range of factors, which make it difficult to forecast our future results of operations.\n• We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\n• The estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in\nwhich we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\n• We face intense competition, including from well-established companies that offer products that compete with ours.\n• We may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position, which may harm\nour ability to add new customers, retain existing customers, and grow our business.\n• If we are unable to attract new customers and renew existing customers, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations will be adversely affected.\n• If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, or changing\nregulations, or to changing customer or consumer needs, requirements or preferences, our platform may become less\ncompetitive.\n• We are substantially dependent upon customers renewing their subscriptions to, and expanding their use of, our\nplatform to maintain and grow our revenue, which requires us to scale our platform infrastructure and business quickly\nenough to meet our customers’ growing needs. If we are not able to grow in an efficient manner, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\n• Failure to effectively develop our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to expand our customer base\nand achieve broader market adoption of our platform and products.\n• We are dependent on a single platform, and the failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our platform could\ncause our results of operations to suffer.\n• If our platform fails to perform properly or there are defects or disruptions in the rollout of our platform updates or\nenhancements, our reputation could be adversely affected, our market share could decline, and we could be subject to\nliability claims.\n• We may need to reduce prices or change our pricing model to remain competitive.\n• Our business depends on our ability to send consumer engagement messages over a number of different channels and\nany significant disruption in service with our third-party providers or on mobile operating systems could result in a\n41\nTable of Contents\nloss of customers or less effective consumer-brand engagement, which could harm our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\n• We rely upon third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, to host our\nproducts. Any disruption in the operations of these third-party providers or limitations on capacity or interference with\nour use could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n• We are subject to stringent and changing laws and regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations related to\nprivacy, data security and data protection. The restrictions and costs imposed by these requirements and our actual or\nperceived failure to comply with them, could harm our business.\n• If we or our third-party service providers experience a security breach or unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access\nto our customers’ data, our data or our platform, our solution may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may\nbe harmed, demand for our platform and products may be reduced and we may incur significant liabilities.\n• Changes in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in the internet infrastructure itself may diminish the\ndemand for our platform and could have a negative impact on our business.\n• We employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or\nerrors or vulnerabilities in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which\nwould adversely affect our business.\n• The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our executive officers,\ndirectors and significant holders of our capital stock, which limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock\nto influence the outcome of important transactions.\nRisks Related to Our Growth and Capital Requirements\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and\nshare price.\nThe global economy, including credit and financial markets, has experienced extreme volatility and disruptions,\nincluding severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth,\nincreases in unemployment rates, increases in inflation rates, higher interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability.\nThese unfavorable conditions have been, and may continue to be, exacerbated in the United States and abroad by global and\ndomestic socioeconomic conditions, including the failure of high-profile banking and other financial institutions, the Federal\nReserve’s attempts to combat inflation through interest rate increases, unrest in international trade relations, domestic and\nforeign political turmoil, natural catastrophes, pandemics related to highly infectious diseases, warfare and terrorist attacks on\nthe United States, Europe, the Asia Pacific region or elsewhere, and international military conflicts and the related political and\neconomic responses. Continued volatility and disruptions may have adverse consequences on us or the third parties on whom\nwe rely. If the financial, equity or credit markets further deteriorate, including as a result of the measures taken to combat\ninflation, volatility in the banking and financial services sector, political unrest or war, it may make any necessary debt or\nequity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. Increased\ninflation rates can adversely affect us by increasing our costs, including labor and employee benefits costs. In addition, higher\ninflation and macroeconomic turmoil and uncertainty could also adversely affect our customers, which could reduce demand for\nour products and services. For instance, we were founded in 2011, but our business and revenue have grown rapidly over the\nlast several years. As a result of our limited history operating at our current scale, our ability to accurately forecast our future\nresults of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future\ngrowth, particularly in a volatile economic environment. Recent increases in inflation, economic volatility and related increases\nin interest rates have affected customer spending behavior. Significant continued increases in inflation, continued economic\nvolatility and related increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. To the extent there is a sustained general economic downturn and our customer engagement platform is\nperceived by customers and potential customers as too costly, or too difficult to deploy or migrate to, our revenue may be\ndisproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general customer engagement technology spending. This perception has\npreviously, and may continue to, result in an extension of our sales cycle with potential customers, thus increasing the time and\ncost associated with our sales process. Further, even if our customers choose to use our platform, they may nonetheless reduce\ntheir customer engagement technology spending and elect not to purchase additional products and services in the future due to\nbudget limitations. Also, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our\ncurrent and potential customers. In addition, macroeconomic uncertainty may result in an increased pace of consolidation in\ncertain industries in which our customers operate. If this were to occur it may result in reduced overall spending on our\nservices, particularly if our customers are acquired by organizations that do not use our services. We cannot predict the timing,\nstrength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular industry. If the\neconomic conditions of the general economy or the markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur rapid revenue growth may not be indicative of our future revenue growth. Our rapid revenue growth also makes it\ndifficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOur revenue was $281.0 million and $216.9 million for the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. You\nshould not rely on our historical revenue growth as an indication of our future performance. Even if our revenue continues to\nincrease, we expect that our annual revenue growth rate will decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including the\nmaturation of our business. Overall growth of our revenue depends on several factors, including our ability to:\n• expand subscriptions for additional functionality within our platform to our existing customers;\n• expand the products for and functionality of our platform and achieve market acceptance for them;\n• attract new customers, particularly in verticals and organizations where we have already experienced revenue growth;\n• succeed in selling our products outside the United States;\n• continue to partner with existing customers to improve our platform and its products and functionality;\n• keep pace with technological developments;\n• price our platform subscriptions effectively;\n• provide our customers with support that meets their needs;\n• successfully identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or\nexpand our platform; and\n• increase awareness of our brand on a global basis and successfully compete with other companies.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives and, as a result, it is difficult for us to forecast our future\nresults of operations. If the assumptions that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our\nmarket or as a result of macroeconomic pressures on us or our customers, or if we are unable to maintain revenue growth, our\nstock price could be volatile, it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability, and our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected. The adverse effect on our results of operations resulting from a failure to\nachieve our revenue expectations may be particularly acute because of the significant research, development, marketing, sales\nand other expenses we expect to incur.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if\nat all.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, including through the public markets\nin our initial public offering, and sales of subscriptions to our platform. We cannot be certain when or if our operations will\ngenerate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make\ninvestments to support our business and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to\ndevelop new features or enhance our platform, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and\ntechnologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Additional financing\nmay not be available on terms favorable to us, including as a result of inflationary pressure and a higher interest rate\nenvironment, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth\nopportunities, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we incur debt, the debt holders\nwould have rights senior to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of\nany debt could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters,\nany of which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Furthermore, if\nwe issue equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to\nthose of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will\ndepend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or\nnature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt\nor equity securities reducing the value of our Class A common stock and diluting their interests.\nWe have a limited history operating at our current scale, and our future results of operations may fluctuate significantly due\nto a wide range of factors, which make it difficult to forecast our future results of operations.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to many factors, many of which are\noutside of our control, including:\n• failure to execute on our growth strategies;\n• the level of demand for our platform;\n• the rate of renewal of subscriptions with, and extent of sales of additional subscriptions to, existing customers;\n• the size, timing, duration and pricing, and other terms of our subscription agreements with existing and new customers;\n• the introduction of new products and product enhancements by existing competitors or new entrants into our market,\nand changes in pricing for products offered by our competitors;\n• network outages, security breaches and other cyber-attacks, technical difficulties with or interruptions to our platform;\n• customers delaying purchasing decisions in anticipation of new developments or enhancements by us or our\ncompetitors or otherwise;\n• changes in customers’ budgets;\n43\nTable of Contents\n• seasonal variations related to sales and marketing and other activities, such as expenses related to our customers’\nincreased usage of our platform and products during the fourth quarter;\n• our ability to increase, retain and incentivize the strategic partners that market and sell our platform;\n• the timing of growth of our business, in particular through our hiring of new employees and international expansion;\n• our ability to control our operating expenses and other costs;\n• our ability to hire, train and maintain our direct sales team;\n• unforeseen litigation and inability to enforce, protect or defend our intellectual property, or claims of infringement by\nthird parties;\n• the timing of our adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to us and the impact on our results\nof operations;\n• fluctuations in our effective tax rate; and\n• general economic and political conditions, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which\nour customers operate.\nAny one of these or other risks or uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this report or the cumulative effect of some of\nthese factors may result in fluctuations in our revenue, results of operations and cash flows, meaning that quarter-to-quarter\ncomparisons of our revenue, results of operations and cash flows may not necessarily be indicative of our future performance,\nmay cause us to miss our guidance and analyst expectations and may cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nAdditionally, if our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change, including as a result of global\nor domestic macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions such as, among others, instability in the banking and financial\nservices sector, international and domestic supply chain risks, inflationary pressure, interest rate increases, declines in consumer\nconfidence, international conflicts and domestic and foreign political unrest, that impact us and our customers, or if we do not\naddress these risks successfully, our revenue and results of operations could differ materially from our expectations, and our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have experienced net losses in each of our last several fiscal years. We generated a net loss of $58.9 million and\n$70.9 million for the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of July 31, 2024, we had an accumulated\ndeficit of $541.7 million. While we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, we cannot guarantee\nwhether or when we will achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We also expect our costs and expenses to increase in\nfuture periods, which could negatively affect our future results of operations if our revenue does not continue to increase. In\nparticular, we intend to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n• our technology infrastructure and operations, including systems architecture, scalability, availability, performance and\nsecurity;\n• our sales and marketing organization, to engage our existing and prospective customers, increase brand awareness and\ndrive adoption of our products;\n• platform development, including investments in our platform development team and the development of new products\nand functionality for our platform, as well as investments in further improving our existing platform and infrastructure;\n• acquisitions or strategic investments;\n• international expansion; and\n• general administration, including increased insurance, legal and accounting expenses associated with being a public\ncompany.\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue. If we are unable to maintain or increase our revenue at a rate\nsufficient to offset the expected increase in our costs, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be\nadversely affected, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability over the long term.\nOur customers may face challenges to their businesses as a result of macroeconomic pressures or changes in the interest\nrate environment. We have in the past, and may in the future, adapt our strategy to address these market dynamics. We cannot\nguarantee that any change in strategy will be successful and such changes may cause our revenue to decline, which may inhibit\nour ability to scale our business and prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability over the long term. Our customers\nmay also terminate their contracts, renew their agreements on terms less favorable to us, or fail to purchase additional product\nsubscriptions. Our historical data and operating experience may also be insufficient to adequately inform our future pricing and\ncontracting strategies in changing market environments. Any reduction in our prices or an increase in our discounting could\nadversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position, and cash flow.\nThe estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which\nwe compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\n44\nTable of Contents\nMarket estimates and growth forecasts are uncertain and based on assumptions and estimates that may be inaccurate. Our\naddressable market depends on a number of factors, including businesses’ desire to differentiate themselves through digital\ncustomer engagement, partnership opportunities, changes in the competitive landscape, technological changes, data security or\nprivacy concerns, customer budgetary constraints, changes in business practices, changes in the regulatory environment and\nchanges in economic conditions. Our estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected growth of our market may prove\nto be inaccurate, and our ability to produce accurate estimates and forecasts may be impacted by economic uncertainty that is\noutside our control, including as a result of global or domestic macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions such as, among\nothers, instability in the banking and financial services sector, international and domestic supply chain risks, inflationary\npressure, interest rate increases, declines in consumer confidence, international conflicts and domestic and foreign political\nunrest, that impact us and our customers. Any of these risks could have a significant impact on our business or the business of\nour customers, either of which could result in a material adverse effect on our results and operations and cause our current\nestimates and projections to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth rates\nwe forecast, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain\nof our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in\nsuch metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including, among others, the number of customers, monthly active users, platform\nenabled interactions, consumer generated data points, customer messages, annual recurring revenue, dollar-based net retention\nrate and Non-GAAP free cash flow. Our operational metrics are tracked with internal systems and tools that are not\nindependently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due\nto differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of\nlimitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes\nto our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics\nundercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate.\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of\nmeasurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations. In addition,\nlimitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our\nunderstanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not\naccurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover\nmaterial inaccuracies with respect to these figures, we expect that our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of\noperations would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Brand\nWe face intense competition, including from well-established companies that offer products that compete with ours. We may\nlack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position, which may harm our ability to\nadd new customers, retain existing customers, and grow our business.\nThe market for customer engagement products is evolving and highly competitive. There are several established and\nemerging competitors that address specific aspects of customer engagement. We face intense competition from software\ncompanies that offer marketing solutions, such as legacy marketing clouds like Adobe and Salesforce, and point solutions like\nAirship, Iterable, Klaviyo, CleverTap (Leanplum) and MoEngage. Many of our existing competitors have, and our potential\ncompetitors could have, substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger\nsales and marketing budgets and resources, greater customer support resources, lower labor and development costs, larger and\nmore mature intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. In\naddition, our competitors may have an advantage in markets where our policies regarding the use of customer data are more\nrestrictive than local laws, regulations, policies and standards. For example, competitors willing to sell customer data in markets\nwhere such activity is permissible may have a pricing advantage over us in such markets. Any such pricing advantages that our\ncompetitors have may negatively affect our ability to gain new customers and retain existing customers. Additionally, to the\nextent there is a sustained general economic downturn, our customers and potential customers may experience delays and\nreductions in general customer engagement technology spending. As a result, our competitors have in the past responded, and\nmay continue in the future to respond, to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our current and\npotential customers. With the introduction of new technologies and the entry of new competitors into the market, we expect\ncompetition to persist and intensify in the future. In addition, in recent years, there has been significant merger and acquisition\nactivity among our competitors, including the acquisition of Leanplum by CleverTap. Continued merger and acquisition\nactivity in the technology industry could further increase the likelihood that we compete with other large technology companies.\nThis could harm our ability to increase sales, maintain or increase subscription renewals, and maintain our prices.\nConditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering by\nour competitors or continuing market consolidation. Some of our larger competitors also have substantially broader product\n45\nTable of Contents\nlines and market focus and therefore may not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. New start-up companies\nthat innovate, and large companies that are making significant investments in research and development, may invent similar or\nsuperior products and technologies that compete with one or more of our platform offerings. In addition, some of our\ncompetitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with agency\npartners, technology and application providers in complementary categories, or other parties. Competitors may also consolidate\nwith existing service providers or strategic partners that we rely on, and as a result we could lose partnerships that are difficult\nto replace. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure, a loss of\nmarket share or a smaller addressable share of the market and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical,\nmarketing, service and other resources, all of which could harm our ability to compete.\nSome of our larger competitors may use their broader product offerings to compete with us, including by bundling their\ncompetitive products with other products being purchased from that company by a customer or by restricting access to their\ntechnology platforms thereby making it more difficult for customers to integrate the use of our platform with other competitor\nproducts. Potential customers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of\nproduct performance or features. Furthermore, potential customers may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their\nexisting infrastructure from competitors than to replace their existing infrastructure with our platform and products. These\ncompetitive pressures in our market, or our failure to compete effectively, may result in price reductions, fewer sales, reduced\nrevenue and gross margins, increased net losses and loss of, or failure to expand, our market share. Any failure to address these\nchallenges could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers and renew existing customers, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenue, we must continue to attract new customers and retain, and sell more products to, existing\ncustomers. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of our platform and products as an\nalternative to existing products in which many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources and,\ntherefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to abandon. In addition, as our market matures, our products evolve and competitors\nintroduce lower cost or differentiated products that are perceived to compete with our platform, products and services, our\nability to sell subscriptions for our products could be impaired. Similarly, our subscription sales could be adversely affected if\ncustomers or users within these organizations perceive that features incorporated into competitive products reduce the need for\nour products or if they prefer to purchase other products that are bundled with products offered by other companies that operate\nin adjacent markets and compete with our products. In addition, the value of our products and services to our customers\ndepends, in part, on our customers’ ability to use them as part of an overall effective marketing strategy. To the extent our\ncustomers’ marketing strategies are not effective, they may reduce the use of our products and services or fail to renew their\nexisting contracts. Further, to the extent there is a sustained general economic downturn and our customers and potential\ncustomers experience delays or reductions in general customer engagement technology spending, potential customers may be\nunwilling to take on the additional cost associated with adopting our platform as an alternative to their existing products or\nservice providers, and if they choose to adopt our platform, they may not purchase additional products and services in the future\ndue to budget limitations. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to attract new customers, which may have an\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, or changing\nregulations, or to changing customer or consumer needs, requirements or preferences, our platform may become less\ncompetitive.\nOur ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to\nenhance and improve our platform and its products and functionality, increase adoption and usage of our platform, and\nintroduce new products and functionality. The market in which we compete is subject to rapid technological change, evolving\nindustry standards and changing regulations, as well as changing customer and consumer needs, requirements and preferences,\nincluding changes in the use of channels through which consumers desire to communicate with brands.Additionally, we cannot\npredict what, if any, actions regulators will take regarding the use and sale of customer engagement software or in our key\nmarkets in the future. Any regulatory restrictions on the use of customer engagement tools from domestic or foreign regulators\ncould have the effect of reducing demand for our platform in this and other markets. Further, recent advances in, and the public\navailability of, generative artificial intelligence may be a significant disruptor in consumer engagement and marketing\nstrategies. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a\ntimely basis. If we are unable to enhance our platform offerings to keep pace with rapid technological and regulatory change, or\nif new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or\nmore securely than our platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Further\nas we develop, acquire, and introduce new services and technologies, including those that may incorporate artificial intelligence\nand machine learning, we may be subject to new or heightened legal, ethical, and other challenges.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThe success of our platform depends, in part, on our ability to continuously modify and enhance our platform to adapt to\nchanges and innovation in existing and new technologies to maintain and grow our integrations. We expect that the number of\nintegrations with our customers’ infrastructure that we will need to support will continue to expand as developers adopt new\nsoftware solutions, and we will have to develop new versions of our platform to work with those new solutions. This\ndevelopment effort may require significant engineering, sales and marketing resources, all of which could adversely affect our\nbusiness. Any failure of our platform to operate effectively with customer infrastructures could reduce the demand for our\nplatform, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are substantially dependent upon customers renewing their subscriptions to, and expanding their use of, our platform to\nmaintain and grow our revenue, which requires us to scale our platform infrastructure and business quickly enough to meet\nour customers’ growing needs. If we are not able to grow in an efficient manner, our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations could be harmed.\nAs usage of our platform grows and as customers use it for more complex projects, we may need to devote additional\nresources to improving our platform architecture, updating our platform’s products and functionality, integrating with third-\nparty systems and maintaining infrastructure performance. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business\nas well as grow our partner services network to serve our growing customer base, particularly as our customer base expands\nover time. Our ability to scale our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our revenue through new and\nrenewed customer subscriptions to our platform, from which we derive substantially all of our revenue. We cannot assure you\nthat we will be able to renew subscriptions with any of our customers at the same or higher contract value, particularly if our\ncustomers experience reductions or delays in general customer engagement technology spending in connection with a sustained\ngeneral economic downturn. In addition, some customers have multiple order forms with different divisions of their entities,\nwhich could increase the complexity of negotiating renewals.\nThe market for customer engagement products is still evolving, and competitive dynamics may cause our pricing to\nchange as the market matures and as existing and new market participants introduce new types of products and different\napproaches to enable customers to address their needs. As a result, we may be forced to reduce the prices we charge for our\nsubscriptions and may be required to offer terms less favorable to us for new and renewal agreements, particularly for mid- to\nlarge-size enterprises that may demand substantial price discounts as part of the negotiation of subscription contracts.\nFurther, some of our contracts limit the amount we can increase prices from period to period or include pricing\nguarantees. Accordingly, these pricing restrictions may cause the revenue generated from these contracts to not keep pace with\nour costs, particularly if we are adversely affected by increasing costs caused by inflation, including labor and employee benefit\ncosts. We have in the past, and may in the future, adapt our strategy to address these market dynamics for customers that were\nsignificantly negatively impacted by the macroeconomic environment. We cannot guarantee that any change in strategy will be\nsuccessful and such changes may cause our revenue to decline, which may inhibit our ability to scale our business and prevent\nus from achieving and maintaining profitability over the long term. Our customers may also terminate their contracts, renew\ntheir agreements on terms less favorable to us, or fail to purchase additional product subscriptions. As such, our revenue may\ndecline, and, as a result, our ability to scale our business may be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of\noperations would likely be harmed as a result.\nAny failure of or delay in efforts to scale our business could cause difficulty or delay in deploying our products or\nfunctionality to customers, could lead to impaired performance, other declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increased\ncosts, difficulty in introducing new features or other operational inefficiencies or failures. These issues could reduce the\nattractiveness of our platform to customers, resulting in decreased subscriptions with existing and new customers, lower\nsubscription renewal rates, the issuance of service credits or requests for refunds, which could hurt our revenue growth and our\nreputation. Even if we can upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will be expensive and complex,\nrequiring management time and attention, as well as improvements to our operational and financial controls and reporting\nsystems and procedures. Because of these risks and other inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding\nour information technology systems, any needed expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems may not be\nfully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. Any such expansion efforts may reduce revenue or may not bring\nthe benefits we anticipate, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFailure to effectively develop our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to expand our customer base and\nachieve broader market adoption of our platform and products.\nOur ability to expand our customer base and achieve broader market adoption of our platform will depend on the\nproductivity of our sales and marketing operations. We plan to continue expanding our sales team and strategic partners over\nthe long term, both domestically and internationally; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and\nretaining talented sales personnel or strategic partners or that any new sales personnel will be able to achieve productivity in a\nreasonable period of time or at all. We also plan to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs to drive new\ncustomer acquisition, as well as engage with customers to promote upsell and cross-sell opportunities. For example, to\n47\nTable of Contents\nencourage awareness, usage, familiarity and adoption of our platform and products, we plan to offer free trials of our platform.\nThis strategy may not be successful in leading customers to purchase long term subscriptions of our product, as usage of our\nfree tier may not cause users or others within their organization to purchase and deploy our platform. We also engage with\nindustry analysts, consulting firms, marketing service providers, data and technology partners, marketing agencies and other\nsolution partners, business and trade press, and other industry experts who exert considerable influence in our market to\npromote our platform and our brand. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our sales and\nmarketing efforts do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated revenue\ngrowth from expanding our sales team if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our new sales\npersonnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing\nprograms are not effective. If the cost of marketing our platform and products increases or competition reduces the effectiveness\nof our marketing efforts, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a single platform, and the failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our platform could cause\nour results of operations to suffer.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is attributable to subscriptions for our cloud-based platform. We expect that we will be\nsubstantially dependent on our platform to generate revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, our results of operations\ncould suffer due to:\n• any decline in demand for our platform, including as a result of reductions or delays in general customer engagement\ntechnology spending by our customers and potential customers in connection with a sustained general economic\ndownturn;\n• the failure of our platform to achieve continued market acceptance;\n• the market for our platform not continuing to grow, or growing more slowly than we expect;\n• the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an\nimprovement over, our platform;\n• technological innovations or new standards that our platform does not address;\n• incidents or interruptions with third-party service providers, including Apple or Google services, that affect the ability\nof our customers to use our platform;\n• sensitivity to current or future prices offered by us or our competitors;\n• our inability to release enhanced versions of our platform on a timely basis;\n• the development of new communication channels with which we are not able to adequately integrate our platform; and\n• changes to mobile devices and platforms that prevent or degrade the functionality of our platform, or our inability to\nmaintain interoperability of our platform with such mobile devices and platforms.\nIf the market for our platform grows more slowly than anticipated or if demand for our products does not grow as\nquickly as anticipated, whether as a result of competition, pricing sensitivities, product obsolescence, technological change,\nunfavorable economic conditions, uncertain geopolitical environment, budgetary constraints of our customers or other factors,\nwe may not be able to grow our revenue, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely\naffected.\nIf our platform fails to perform properly or there are defects or disruptions in the rollout of our platform updates or\nenhancements, our reputation could be adversely affected, our market share could decline, and we could be subject to\nliability claims.\nOur platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors. Any defects or errors that impact\nfunctionality or that cause interruptions in the availability of our platform could result in:\n• loss or delayed market acceptance and subscriptions;\n• breach of warranty claims;\n• breach of contract claims;\n• sales credits or refunds for prepaid amounts;\n• loss of customers;\n• diversion of development and support resources; and\n• injury to our reputation.\nThe costs we would be forced to incur to correct any material defects or errors could be substantial and could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customer agreements often provide service level commitments. We have in the past, and may in the future, fail to\nmeet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability of our platform. Any such incident could\nresult in us being obligated to provide these customers with service credits. We could also face contract terminations or refusal\n48\nTable of Contents\nby certain of our customers to renew as a result of any such outages. We outsource substantially all the infrastructure relating to\nour cloud-based platform to third-party hosting providers and, as a result, our services may be impacted in the future, and have\nbeen impacted in the past, by unscheduled downtime at such providers that is beyond our control. Our revenue has in the past\nbeen affected, and could be significantly affected in the future, by unscheduled downtime that exceeds the allowed downtimes\nunder our agreements with our customers.\nBecause of the large amount of data that we collect, process, transmit, store and manage, it is possible that hardware\nfailures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete which may\nresult in breach of contract claims, damage our reputation or subject us to regulatory fines or investigations. Furthermore, the\navailability or performance of our platform could be adversely affected by a number of factors outside our control, including\ncustomers’ inability to access the internet, the failure of software systems caused by our third-party vendors, security breaches,\ncyberattacks or variability in user traffic for our services. For example, our customers access our platform through their internet\nservice providers. If a customer’s service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our platform or otherwise\nexperiences service outages, such failure could interrupt our customers’ access to our platform and adversely affect their\nperception of our platform’s reliability. In addition to potential liability, if we experience interruptions in the availability of our\ncloud-based platform, our reputation could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers or have difficulty acquiring new\ncustomers.\nWe also provide frequent incremental releases of updates and functional enhancements to our platform. Despite\nextensive pre-release testing, such new versions occasionally contain undetected errors when first introduced or released. We\nhave, from time to time, found errors in our platform, and new errors in our platform may be detected in the future. Since our\ncustomers use our products for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in our platform or other\nperformance problems with our solutions could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses. If that occurs,\nsome of our customers may delay or withhold payment to us, elect not to renew their subscriptions with us, make service credit\nclaims, warranty claims or other claims against us, and we could lose future sales. The occurrence of any of these events could\nresult in an increase in our bad debt expense, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or a decrease in future\nrevenue and earnings, or could cause us to incur the risk or expense of litigation.\nWe may need to reduce prices or change our pricing model to remain competitive.\nOur subscription fees are principally based on an upfront commitment by our customers for a specific number of\nmonthly active users, messaging volume, platform access and/or support and certain add-on products. We expect that we may\nneed to change our pricing from time to time. As new or existing competitors introduce products that compete with ours or\nreduce their prices, we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers. We also must determine the\nappropriate price to enable us to compete effectively internationally. Customers may demand substantial price discounts as part\nof the negotiation of subscription agreements. As a result, we may be required or choose to reduce our prices or otherwise\nchange our pricing model, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales cycle with large enterprise customers can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable\ntime and expense.\nThe timing of our sales cycles with our large enterprise customers and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict\nbecause of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for these customers. Large enterprise customers may have a lengthy\nsales cycle for the evaluation and procurement of our platform. Additionally, to the extent there is a sustained general economic\ndownturn resulting in delays or reductions in general customer engagement technology spending by large enterprise customers,\nwe may experience an extension of our sales cycle with potential customers or a reduction in sales cycle win rates due to\nbudgetary constraints. Any delays in our sales cycles may cause a delay between increasing operating expenses for such sales\nefforts and, upon successful sales, the generation of corresponding revenue. We are often required to spend significant time and\nresources to better educate our potential large enterprise customers and familiarize them with the platform. The length of our\nsales cycle for these customers, from initial evaluation to contract execution, is generally three to six months but can vary\nsubstantially and sometimes extend for over 12 months. Large enterprise customers often view a subscription to our platform\nand products as a strategic decision with significant investment. As a result, customers frequently require considerable time to\nevaluate, test and qualify our platform prior to entering into or expanding a subscription. During the sales cycle, we expend\nsignificant time and money on sales and marketing and contract negotiation activities, which may not result in a sale. Moreover,\nlarge enterprise customers may demand complicated configuration and integration services, which can increase our upfront\ninvestment with no guarantee that these customers will deploy our offering widely enough across their organization to justify\nour substantial upfront investment. Further, if we are not able to satisfy the demands of our enterprise customers, we may also\nface reputational harm.\nAdditional factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include:\n• the effectiveness of our sales team as we hire and train our new salespeople to sell to large enterprise customers;\n49\nTable of Contents\n• our ability to meet with customers in person during a sales cycle;\n• the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;\n• the obstacles placed by customers’ procurement process;\n• economic conditions and other factors impacting customer budgets;\n• customers’ familiarity with our products;\n• customers’ evaluation of competing products during the purchasing process; and\n• evolving customer demands.\nGiven these factors, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed. Consequently, a shortfall in\ndemand for our products and services or a decline in new or renewed contracts in a given period may not significantly reduce\nour revenue for that period but could negatively affect our revenue in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and reputation could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with the integration,\nimplementation, or services provided by us or our partners.\nThe success of our business depends on our customers’ satisfaction with our platform, the support that we provide for\nour platform and the services that we provide to help integrate and utilize our platform. Onboarding services may be performed\nby our own staff, by a third party or by a combination of the two. We have partnered with third parties to increase the breadth,\ncapability and depth of capacity for delivery of these onboarding services to our customers, and third parties provide a\nsignificant portion of such support. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or\nwith the solutions delivered, we could incur additional costs to address the deficiency, which would diminish the profitability of\nthe customer relationship. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our\nability to sell new products to existing and new customers will suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers\nwill be harmed, even if the dissatisfaction is with services provided by a third party partner. Further, customer dissatisfaction\nwith our services could impair our ability to expand the subscriptions within our customer base or adversely affect our\ncustomers’ renewal of existing subscriptions. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of\naccuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with actual and prospective\ncustomers.\nBecause we generally recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription agreement, downturns or upturns in our\nsales may not be immediately reflected in our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription agreement. Consequently, while a decline in new sales\nor renewals in any one period may not be reflected in our revenue for that period, this decline will negatively affect our revenue\nin future periods. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our products and potential\nchanges in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our model also\nmakes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers\ngenerally is recognized over the term of the applicable agreement.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base may be impaired and our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is important to support the marketing and sale of our existing and\nfuture products to new customers and expand sales of our platform and products to existing customers. We also believe that the\nimportance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successfully maintaining and enhancing\nour brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide reliable products that continue\nto meet the needs of our customers at competitive prices, our ability to maintain our customers’ trust, our ability to continue to\ndevelop new functionality and use cases, and our ability to successfully differentiate our products and platform capabilities\nfrom competitive products. If we are not able to effectively differentiate our platform and its capabilities from those of our\ncompetitors, we may experience difficulty in attracting new customers. Our brand promotion activities may not generate\ncustomer awareness or yield increased revenue and, even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we\nincur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service\nand customer satisfaction or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe may continue to experience rapid growth and organizational change, which may continue to place significant\ndemands on our management and our operational and financial resources. We have also experienced growth in the number of\ncustomers, the number of engagements we enable and the amount of data that our infrastructure supports. In particular,\nacquiring and supporting enterprise customers can require significant resources due to their size, volume of messaging and\n50\nTable of Contents\ncomplexity. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively. We will require significant capital\nexpenditures and valuable management resources to grow without undermining our culture of innovation, teamwork and\nattention to customer success, which has been central to our growth so far.\nWe intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. Our expansion will continue to place a\nsignificant strain on our managerial, administrative, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage our growth\nsuccessfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIt is important that we maintain a high level of customer services, integration services, technical support and satisfaction\nas we expand our business. As our customer base continues to grow and as our penetration within existing customers expands,\nwe will need to expand our account management, customer service and other personnel. Failure to manage growth could result\nin difficulty or delays in launching our platform, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in\nintroducing new features, or other operational difficulties. Any of these could adversely impact our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe anticipate that our operations will continue to increase in complexity as we grow, which will create management\nchallenges.\nOur business has experienced strong growth and is complex. We expect this growth to continue and for our operations to\nbecome increasingly complex. To manage this growth, we continue to make substantial investments to improve our operational,\nfinancial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to implement and\nscale improvements to our systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect\nour results of operations. For example, we may not be able to effectively monitor certain contract requirements for specific\nproducts. We may have difficulty managing improvements to our systems, processes and controls or in connection with third-\nparty software, which could impair our ability to provide our platform to our customers, causing us to lose customers, limiting\nour platform to less significant updates or increasing our technical support costs. If we are unable to manage this complexity,\nour business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs our customer base continues to grow, we will need to expand our services and other personnel, and maintain and\nenhance our partnerships, to provide a high level of customer service. We also will need to manage our sales processes as our\nsales personnel and partner network continue to grow and become more complex and as we continue to expand into new\ngeographies and market segments. If we do not effectively manage this increasing complexity, the quality of our platform and\ncustomer service could suffer, and we may not be able to adequately address competitive challenges. These factors could impair\nour ability to attract and retain customers and expand our customers’ use of our platform.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain\nhighly skilled employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers, particularly our chief executive\nofficer. We rely heavily on our chief executive officer’s vision, expertise and reputation. We rely on our leadership team for\nresearch and development, marketing, sales, services and general and administrative functions, and on mission-critical\nindividual contributors. From time to time, our executive management team may change due to the hiring or departure of\nexecutives, which could disrupt our business. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key\npersonnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period; therefore, they could terminate their\nemployment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers, particularly our chief executive officer, or\nkey employees (including any limitation on the performance of their duties or short-term or long-term absences as a result of\nillness or disability) could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is\nintense, especially for experienced software engineers and senior sales executives. We expect to continue to experience\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, as a result of our hybrid work model,\nwe have a large, remote workforce, which adds to the complexity and costs of our business operations. Our hybrid work model\nmay impact our ability to identify, hire and train new personnel. Also, as a public company, potential candidates may not\nperceive our compensation package, including our equity awards, as favorably as employees hired prior to our initial public\noffering or as compared to our private competitors. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology and approach may need\nto be altered to address a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such changes in a\ntimely manner. Also, it is not uncommon for companies to see significant turnover in their workforce following an initial public\noffering, a trend which may only be further amplified by the competitive market for highly-skilled employees. If we fail to\nattract new personnel, experience significant turnover or the loss of key personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current\npersonnel, it could adversely affect our business and future growth prospects. Further, many of the companies with which we\ncompete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other\n51\nTable of Contents\ncompanies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting\nin a diversion of our time and resources.\nIf we are unable to maintain our culture and core values as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion and\nfocus on execution that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe our culture and core values are critical to our success and have delivered tangible financial and operational\nbenefits to our customers, employees and stockholders. We are a mission-driven company and have designed our core values as\na guiding set of principles for our employees and business. Accordingly, we have invested substantial time and resources in\nbuilding a team that reflects our culture and core values. As we grow and develop our infrastructure as a public company, our\noperations may become increasingly complex. We may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture and\ncore values. In addition, the growth of our remote workforce may impact our ability to preserve our culture and core values.\nAny failure to preserve our culture or core values could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and\nrecruit personnel, and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property\ninfringement, violations of privacy, data protection and other laws, regulations or contractual obligations, data breaches and\nother losses.\nMany of our agreements with customers and certain other third parties include indemnification provisions under which\nwe agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, violation\nof applicable privacy, data protection or other laws, regulations or contractual obligations, data breaches or other liabilities\nrelating to or arising from our platform, products or other contractual obligations. Some of these agreements provide for\nuncapped liability for losses caused by claims alleging gross negligence or willful misconduct, or claims alleging third party\nintellectual property infringement, and some indemnity provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable\nagreement. While we generally cap all other liabilities, in some instances, the cap may represent a significant amount of\npotential liability, and such large indemnity payments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to these obligations, we may still incur substantial liability\nrelated to them and we may be required to cease use of certain functionalities offered by our platform as a result of any such\nclaims. Additionally, while we maintain insurance related to these matters, this insurance might not cover all such claims,\nprovide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more of such claims or continue to be available on terms\nacceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could result in unanticipated costs, and our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Further, any dispute with a customer with\nrespect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer, other existing customers and new\ncustomers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current operations are international in scope, and we plan further geographic expansion. This will create a variety of\noperational challenges.\nA component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally.\nWe currently have customers in North America, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. We are\ncontinuing to adapt and develop strategies to address international markets, but such efforts may not be successful. In addition,\nany future stay-at-home, business closure and other restrictive orders and travel restrictions into and outside the United States as\na result of international conflicts, domestic unrest or the emergence of new highly infectious diseases, if any, may pose\nadditional challenges for international expansion and may impact our ability to launch new locations and further expand\ngeographically.\nWe expect that our international activities will continue to grow over the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue\nopportunities in existing and new international markets. This and any other future expansion of our international activities and\noperations will require significant management attention and financial resources.\nOur current international operations and future initiatives involve a variety of risks, including:\n• changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;\n• the need to adapt and localize our platform for specific countries;\n• greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;\n• unexpected changes in laws, regulatory requirements, taxes or trade laws;\n• more stringent regulations relating to privacy, data security and data protection and the collection, transmission, use or\nother processing of, or access to, sensitive, proprietary, confidential, regulated and personal data, particularly in\nEurope;\n• differing labor regulations, especially in regions where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as\ncompared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in some of these locations;\n52\nTable of Contents\n• difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative\ndispute systems and regulatory systems;\n• increased travel, real estate, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international operations;\n• currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses and the cost and risk of\nentering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future;\n• laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general preferences for local vendors;\n• limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing our intellectual property;\n• political instability, economic sanctions, terrorist activities, or international conflicts may impact the operations of our\nbusiness or the businesses of our customers;\n• risks related to global health epidemics and related restrictions on our ability and our customers’ ability to travel;\n• exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the\nU.S. Travel Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the U.K. Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and similar laws and regulations\nin other jurisdictions; and\n• adverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.\nFailure to overcome any of these difficulties could negatively affect our results of operations. If we invest substantial\ntime and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully, our business, financial condition\nand results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe have a limited history of operating with a substantial remote workforce and the long-term impact of this workplace\narrangement on our financial results and business operations is uncertain.\nIn September 2022, we implemented our hybrid work model, pursuant to which each department may choose to have its\nemployees function primarily as in-person, remote or hybrid workers. We have also hired a large number of employees who are\npermanently remote, regardless of their department’s determination. As a result, remote work has become the primary\nexperience for a large number of our employees, and our intention is for our workforce to continue to have remote work\nopportunities into the future. However, we have a limited history of operating with a large remote workforce and, while we\nanticipate that implementing our hybrid work model will have a long-term positive impact on our financial results and business\noperations, the impact remains uncertain, particularly in the near term. Additionally, there is no guarantee that we will realize\nany anticipated benefits to our business, including any cost savings, operational efficiencies or productivity.\nOur continuing shift to hybrid and remote work may make it increasingly difficult to manage our business and\nadequately oversee our employees and business functions, potentially resulting in harm to our company culture, increased\nemployee attrition, the loss of key personnel, difficulty in properly classifying employees and a potentially negative impact on\nproduct research and development, and the growth of our business. We may also experience an increased risk of privacy and\ndata security breaches and incidents involving our or our customers’ data as a result of the decentralization of the technology\nused to operate our business. The mobility of our remote workers may also subject us to an increased risk of regulatory claims\nif our remote employees establish a nexus for our business in unanticipated jurisdictions. This could cause us to be subject to\ntax and employment claims in the applicable jurisdiction. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition\nand operating results.\nWe may also face operational or other challenges as we and our customers, partners, suppliers and vendors and other\nparties with whom we do business continue to adjust to a hybrid model of remote and onsite work. These challenges may result\nin operational inefficiencies or employee dissatisfaction, either of which could harm our business.\nAcquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify, pose integration challenges, divert\nthe attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, joint ventures, products and platform\ncapabilities, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products and platform capabilities, enhance our\ntechnical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Further, our proceeds from our initial public offering increase the\nlikelihood that we will devote resources to exploring larger and more complex acquisitions and investments than we have\npreviously attempted. We may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or business opportunities or be\nsuccessful in entering into an agreement with any particular strategic partner. Additionally, any such acquisition or investment\nmay divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing\nsuitable opportunities, whether or not the transactions are completed, and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and\nexpenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products and\nplatform capabilities, personnel or operations of any acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of an acquired\ncompany choose not to work for us, their software is not easily adapted to work with our platform or we have difficulty\nretaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management or otherwise. These transactions\n53\nTable of Contents\nmay also disrupt our business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be\navailable for development of our existing business. Any such transactions that we are able to complete may not result in any\nsynergies or operational, financial or other benefits we had expected to achieve, which could result in impairment charges that\ncould be substantial. These transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt,\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the resulting business\nfrom such a transaction fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be\nadversely affected, or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nOur business depends on our ability to send consumer engagement messages over a number of different channels and any\nsignificant disruption in service with our third-party providers or on mobile operating systems could result in a loss of\ncustomers or less effective consumer-brand engagement, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract new customers depend on the reliable performance of our technology\ninfrastructure and content delivery. Our platform engages with consumers through a number of channels and integrations, and\nwe are dependent on third-party providers for delivery of content in many of these channels and integrations, including, among\nothers, emails, SMS/MMS, third-party messaging services and audience sync advertising campaigns. We are also dependent on\nApple services and Google services for delivery of mobile and web notifications. If any of these third-party providers change\ntheir policies regarding the delivery of certain messages or content, or if our customers do not comply with these third-party\nproviders’ current policies or procedures, some of our customers may no longer be able to use the applicable channels and\nintegrations through our platform. Further, if any of these third-party providers were to suspend or terminate our customers’ use\nof their services or to suffer extended service outages, then our customers may not be able to deliver the applicable messages or\ncontent using our platform. If this were to occur, it could lead to customer dissatisfaction, harm to our reputation or subject us\nto liability, any of which may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, any incident\nbroadly affecting the interaction of Apple or Android devices with necessary Apple or Google services (e.g., iCloud or Apple\npush notifications), including any delays or interruptions in such Apple or Google services, could adversely affect our business.\nFurther, any cybersecurity events affecting Apple or Google Android devices could result in a disruption to Apple or Google\nservices, regulatory investigations, reputational damage and a loss of sales and customers for Apple or Google, which could in\nturn impact our business. A prolonged disruption, cybersecurity event or any other negative event affecting Apple or Google\ncould lead to customer dissatisfaction and could in turn damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us\nto liability and cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We will\nalso face similar risks as we add new channels and integrations to our platform that are supported by third parties if such third\nparties were to face similar challenges or disruptions with regard to their respective channels or integrations. Additionally,\nmany of the third parties that we use or with which we integrate hold us responsible for the acts and omissions of our\ncustomers. While we contractually obligate our customers to comply with the requirements of third-party providers and\napplicable laws when using our platform to deliver content through our messaging channels or integrations, we cannot\nguarantee that all customers will do so at all times. If any of our customers were to use our platform in violation of the policies\nof third-party providers or applicable law, even without our knowledge, we may be subject to financial penalties and\nreputational harm.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective infrastructures, to send\nnotifications through various applications that utilize our platform. Any changes in such systems that negatively impact the\nfunctionality of our platform could adversely affect our ability to interact with consumers in a timely and effective fashion,\nwhich could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers. For example, any anti-tracking features adopted by\nApple or Google that require applications to obtain additional permissions to track end user data may impact our customers’\ndecisions relating to how to interact with end users through our platform. Additionally, if such mobile operating systems change\ntheir policies or otherwise limit or prohibit us from sending notifications or otherwise make changes that degrade the\nfunctionality of our platform, such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile, web, email and other messaging platforms are released, there is no guarantee that\nthese mobile devices and platforms will continue to support our platform or effectively roll out updates to our customers’\napplications. The parties that control the operating systems for mobile devices and such platforms have no obligation to test the\ninteroperability of new mobile devices or platforms with our platform, and third parties may produce new products that are\nincompatible with or not optimal for the operation of our platform. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality customer\nengagement, we need to ensure that our platform is designed to work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems,\nnetworks and standards. If consumers choose to use products or platforms that do not support our platform, or if we do not\nensure our platform can work effectively with such products or platforms, our business and growth could be harmed. We also\nmay not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that permit such\ninteroperability. If we are unable to adapt to changes in popular operating systems, we expect that our customer retention and\ncustomer growth would be adversely affected.\n54\nTable of Contents\nWe rely upon third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, to host our products. Any\ndisruption in the operations of these third-party providers or limitations on capacity or interference with our use could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe outsource substantially all the infrastructure relating to our cloud-based platform to third-party hosting providers.\nOur customers need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance, and we\nprovide many of them with service-level commitments with respect to uptime and, occasionally, throughput. Our products\ndepend on protecting the virtual cloud infrastructure hosted by third-party hosting providers by maintaining its configuration,\narchitecture, features and interconnection specifications, as well as the information stored in these virtual data centers, which is\ntransmitted by third-party internet service providers. Any limitation on the capacity or availability of our third-party hosting\nproviders could impede our ability to onboard new customers or expand the usage of our existing customers, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Currently, we rely on cloud computing\ninfrastructure, particularly from Amazon Web Services, or AWS, to host our platform and support our operations and many of\nthe internal products we use to operate our business. We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS or\nother cloud providers. Each provider’s respective facilities may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes,\nhurricanes, floods, fires, cybersecurity attacks, security breaches, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures\nand other events beyond our or their control. In the event that AWS’s or any other third-party provider’s systems or service\nabilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, our ability to operate our platform may be impaired, our customers\nmay be impacted, we may be subject to claims for refunds or terminations under our contracts, and our reputation and brand\nmay be harmed. A decision to close these facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems, could result in\nlengthy interruptions to our platform. All of the aforementioned risks may be exacerbated if our or our partners’ business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate in such a scenario.\nAdditionally, AWS or other cloud providers may experience threats, attacks or security breaches from computer\nmalware, ransomware, viruses, social engineering (including phishing attacks), denial-of-service or other attacks, employee\nerror, theft or misuse and general hacking, including from state-sponsored or criminal hacking groups, which have become\nmore prevalent in our industry. Any of these security incidents could result in unauthorized access or damage to, or the\ndisablement, encryption, use or misuse, disclosure, modification, destruction or loss of our data or our partners’ data, including\npersonal data, or disrupt our ability to provide our platform or services. Our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted\nperformance is critical to our success. Users may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide\nour platform to them and could make claims for refunds or terminations under our contracts. We may not be able to easily\nswitch our AWS operations to another cloud or other data center provider if there are disruptions or interference with our use of\nany third-party provider’s services, and even if we do switch our operations, the process can require significant time and\nexpense and other cloud and data center providers are subject to the same risks. Sustained or repeated system failures would\nreduce the attractiveness of our platform to our partners, thereby reducing revenue. Moreover, negative publicity arising from\nthese types of disruptions could damage our reputation and may adversely impact use of our platform. We may not carry\nsufficient business interruption insurance or have sufficient contractual remedies to compensate us for losses that may occur as\na result of any events that cause interruptions in our service.\nIn the event that our service agreements with our third-party hosting providers are terminated or there is a lapse of\nservice, elimination of services or features that we utilize, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or damage to\nsuch facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as significant delays and additional expense\nin arranging or creating new facilities and services and/or re-architecting our cloud solution for deployment on a different cloud\ninfrastructure service provider, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur agreement with AWS allows AWS to terminate for any reason with 30 days’ advance notice or in case of a breach of\ncontract if such breach is uncured for 30 days. AWS may also terminate immediately upon notice if (1) AWS determines that\nour use of its service poses a security risk to its services or any other third party, could otherwise adversely impact AWS’s\nsystems, could subject AWS to liability or could be fraudulent, (2) we fail to pay AWS in accordance with our agreement, (3)\nwe cease to operate in the ordinary course, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or become the subject of any\nbankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar proceeding, (4) AWS’s relationship with any third-party\nproviders terminates or requires AWS to change the way it provides services or (5) termination is necessary to comply with the\nlaw or the requests of governmental entities. Although we expect that we could receive similar services from other third parties\nif any of our arrangements with AWS are terminated, transitioning the cloud infrastructure currently hosted by AWS to\nalternative providers would likely be disruptive, and we could incur significant one-time costs. If we are unable to renew our\nagreement with AWS on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our agreement with AWS is prematurely terminated or we\nadd additional infrastructure providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition\nof, new data center providers. If AWS or other infrastructure providers increase the costs of their services, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\n55\nTable of Contents\nIn order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will continue to depend on relationships with strategic partners,\nincluding cloud alliance/marketing, infrastructure and technology partners, to provide broader customer coverage and solution\ndelivery capabilities, and also achieve product stickiness. While our strategic partners have not played a lead role in our\ncustomer generation process in the past, we intend to develop these relationships to rely more heavily on our partners to help us\ngenerate business going forward. Identifying partners, and negotiating, documenting and maintaining relationships with them,\nrequires significant time and resources. Our agreements with our strategic partners are non-exclusive and do not prohibit them\nfrom working with our competitors or recommending competing products. Our competitors may be effective in providing\nincentives to such third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our services. If our\npartners choose to place greater emphasis on products of their own or those offered by our competitors or do not effectively\nmarket and sell our platform, our ability to grow our business and sell our products and services may be adversely affected. In\naddition, acquisitions of our partners by our competitors could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential\ncustomers, as our partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our platform by potential customers.\nWe are highly dependent upon our relationship with the developer platforms, web browsers and operating systems\nprovided by third-party technology companies such as Apple and Google. Changes to mobile device operating systems may\ndiminish the usefulness of marketing providers or require significant modifications or demands on our business to continue\nsupporting those operating systems. Changes to developer platform policies related to third-party software, such as Apple or\nGoogle, creating restrictions that limit the ability of our existing or potential customers to use software development kits or that\nfurther limit the use of cookies could similarly adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the\nmarketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations may\nsuffer. Even if we are successful, it is not assured that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of our platform\nor increased revenue.\nRisks Related to Privacy, Data Security and Data Protection Laws\nWe are subject to stringent and changing laws, regulations, rules, industry standards and contractual obligations related to\nprivacy, data security and data protection. The restrictions and costs imposed by these requirements and our actual or\nperceived failure to comply with them, could harm our business.\nOperating our business and platform involves the collection, use, storage, transfer, sharing and other processing of\nsensitive, proprietary, confidential, regulated and personal data, including such information that we handle on behalf of our\ncustomers. These activities subject us to numerous privacy, data security and data protection obligations, such as various laws,\nregulations, rules, guidance, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts, and other obligations that govern the\nprocessing of personal data by us and on our behalf.\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous privacy, data security and data\nprotection laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, and consumer protection laws. For\nexample, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health\nInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations,\nimposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nFederal laws also limit the processing of personal data of children under 13. Violations of these laws can lead to statutory\npenalties (up to $46,515 per violation in the case of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, for example). If a private\nplaintiff or regulator alleges that our privacy, data security or data protection policies and practices are either unfair or\ndeceptive, we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement. In the United States, there are federal and state laws that\nprohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices, with federal enforcement typically arising out of Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act, or FTC Act. State analogs to the FTC Act, such as the California Unfair Competition Law, often allow for a\nprivate right of action as well.\nSimilarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act), or the CCPA,\nimposes privacy, data security and data protection obligations on businesses to which it applies. These obligations include, but\nare not limited to, providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording California residents certain rights related to\ntheir personal data. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation) and provides a private\nright of action for certain data breaches. Numerous other states also have enacted, or are considering enacting, comprehensive\ndata privacy laws. If we become subject to further new privacy, data security or data protection laws at the state level, the risk\nof enforcement action against us could increase because we may become subject to additional obligations, and the number of\nindividuals or entities that can initiate actions against us may increase (including individuals, via a private right of action, and\nstate actors).\n56\nTable of Contents\nOutside of the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, rules and industry standards apply with respect\nto privacy, data security and data protection. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or the EU\nGDPR, and the version thereof implemented into the laws of the United Kingdom, or the U.K. GDPR, impose strict\nrequirements with respect to processing the personal data of individuals located within the European Economic Area, or the\nEEA, and the United Kingdom, or the U.K., respectively. While the EU GDPR and the U.K. GDPR remain substantially similar\nfor the time being, the U.K. government has announced that it will seek to chart its own path on data protection and reform its\nrelevant laws, including in ways that may differ from the EU GDPR. While these developments increase uncertainty with\nregard to data protection regulation in the U.K., even in their current, substantially similar form, the EU GDPR and U.K. GDPR\ncan expose businesses to divergent parallel regimes that may be subject to different interpretations and enforcement actions for\ncertain violations and related uncertainty. Under the EU GDPR, government regulators may impose temporary or definitive\nbans on data processing, as well as fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater (and the\nU.K. GDPR currently imposes comparable penalties). Furthermore, because both regimes allow for private rights of action,\nindividuals in the EEA and the U.K. may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data.\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. These\nlaws may make it more difficult for us to transfer personal data across jurisdictions, which could impede our business. For\nexample, legal developments in the EEA have created complexity and uncertainty regarding processing and transfers of\npersonal data from the EEA to the United States and other countries outside the EEA. Similar complexities and uncertainties\nalso apply to transfers from the U.K. to third countries. While we have taken steps to mitigate the impact on us, such as\nimplementing the European Commission’s updated standard contractual clauses, or the SCCs, and the U.K.’s international Data\nTransfer Agreement (or the U.K.’s international data transfer addendum that can be used with the SCCs), the validity of relying\non the SCCs as a transfer mechanism has been, and is expected to continue to be, the subject of further litigation in the EU. For\nexample, on May 22, 2023, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission fined Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. 1.2 billion euros for\nviolating the EU GDPR’s data transfer requirements by unlawfully transferring the personal data of Facebook users from the\nEEA to the United States, and ordered Meta to suspend any future transfers of such personal data to the United States within\nfive months and to stop further processing and storing of such personal data in the U.S. within six months, finding that Meta did\nnot have adequate supplementary measures in place in addition to the SCCs. This decision is subject to appeal and applies\nsolely to Meta, however it is possible that, as a result of such decision, where Braze relies on the SCCs for international\ntransfers, that the supplementary measures we have implemented in addition to the SCCs will not be deemed adequate. Since\nthis Meta decision, the EU, U.K. and Switzerland have agreed to a ‘Data Privacy Framework’ for transfers of personal data\nfrom Europe to the U.S. For the time being, this provides an additional valid mechanism for the international transfer of\npersonal data. Privacy activists are expected to challenge the adequacy of this transfer mechanism, and therefore we cannot\nguarantee that such mechanism will remain available to us indefinitely.\nIn addition to EU and U.K. restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal data, other jurisdictions have enacted or are\nconsidering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and data localization laws, any of which could increase the cost and\ncomplexity of doing business in those jurisdictions. If we cannot implement a workable, valid compliance mechanism for cross-\nborder transfers of personal data, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions\nagainst processing or transferring personal data from the EEA or elsewhere. The inability to import personal data to the United\nStates could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, including by limiting our ability to offer our full range\nof services in the EEA and elsewhere, limiting our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to EU and other privacy,\ndata security and data protection laws or requiring us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in the EEA and\nelsewhere at significant expense.\nOur obligations related to privacy, data protection and data security are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent\nfashion. These obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or in conflict\namong jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources (including,\nwithout limitation, financial and time-related resources). These obligations may necessitate changes to our information\ntechnologies, systems and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. In addition, these\nobligations may require us to change our business model. Although we endeavor to comply with all applicable privacy, data\nsecurity and data protection obligations, we may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) to do so. Moreover, despite our\nefforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations which could impact our\ncompliance posture. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with privacy, data security and data\nprotection obligations, we could face significant consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to,\ngovernment enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar actions), litigation\n(including class-related claims), additional reporting requirements or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to\ndelete or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial\ncondition, including, but not limited to, loss of customers, interruptions or stoppages in our business operations, inability to\nprocess personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions, limited ability to develop or commercialize our products, expenditure\nof time and resources to defend any claim or action, adverse publicity or revision or restructuring of our operations.\n57\nTable of Contents\nFor more information on the privacy, data security and data protection laws and regulations to which we are or may\nbecome subject, see the section titled “Business – Privacy, Data Security and Data Protection” in our Annual Report.\nIf we or our third-party service providers experience a security breach or unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access to our\ncustomers’ data, our data or our platform, our solution may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be\nharmed, demand for our platform and products may be reduced and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOperating our business and platform involves the collection, storage, transmission and other processing of sensitive,\nregulated, proprietary and confidential information, including personal data of our customers, their users and our personnel and\nour customers’ proprietary and confidential information. We may rely upon third parties (such as service providers) for our data\nstorage- and data processing–related activities. We may share or receive sensitive data with or from third parties. Cyberattacks,\nmalicious internet-based activity, and online and offline fraud are prevalent and continue to increase in frequency and severity.\nThese threats are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, and these threats come from a variety of sources. In addition to\ntraditional computer “hackers,” threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states, and\nnation-state-supported actors now engage in cyberattacks, including, without limitation, nation-state actors for geopolitical\nreasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. We may be subject to a variety of evolving threats,\nincluding, but not limited to, social-engineering attacks (including through phishing, vishing and hybrid phishing attacks),\nmalicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-\nservice attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error by us or third-party service providers, ransomware\nattacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other\ninformation technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats.\nAdditionally, our customers have been and may be in the future, targeted by similar cyberthreats, and bad actors have accessed,\nand may in the future, access our platform and services using such customer’s credentials. Accordingly, the failure of our\ncustomers to use appropriate cybersecurity technology and practices can result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to our\nplatform and customer data. Ransomware attacks, including those perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states,\nand nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in\nour operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the\nnegative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example,\napplicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. Threat actors could also use artificial intelligence technology for\nmalicious purposes, increasing the frequency and complexity of their attacks, e.g., phishing attacks, fraud, social engineering,\nand other possible malicious uses, such as with writing malware. Code, including code generated by generative artificial\nintelligence, could potentially be used and deployed that contains undetected vulnerable or malicious components. This could\ncause widespread deployment of vulnerable code within our systems. Any of the previously identified or similar threats could\ncause a security incident. We have also implemented a free trial program that may increase the number of users with access to\nour platform, and some of these users may include malicious actors who may attempt to breach our platform’s security. This\nmay heighten the likelihood of us experiencing a cybersecurity incident. Additionally, the risk of these threats may increase for\nus and our third-party service providers due to ongoing international instability. In the past, nation-states have sponsored\ncyberattacks against private companies in response to U.S. governmental actions or for other strategic purposes. We cannot\nguarantee that similar actions will not occur in the future. A security incident could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or\naccidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to data. A security incident\ncould disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our platform.\nWe may expend significant resources or modify our business activities in an effort to protect against security incidents.\nCertain data privacy and security obligations require us to implement and maintain specific security measures, industry-\nstandard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and data. While we have taken steps\ndesigned to protect the proprietary, regulated, sensitive, confidential and personal data in our control, our security measures or\nthose of the third parties on which we rely may not be effective against current or future security risks and threats. Moreover,\nwe or our third-party service providers may be more vulnerable to such attacks in remote work environments, which have\nincreased in recent years and will likely continue into the foreseeable future.\nIf we, our customers or our third-party service providers suffer, or are perceived to have suffered, a security breach or\nother security incident, we may experience adverse consequences. Applicable data privacy and security obligations may require\nus to notify relevant stakeholders or regulators of security incidents. We may also be required to publicly disclose certain\ncybersecurity incidents pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. Such disclosures are costly, and the\ndisclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. If we, our customers or a third\nparty upon whom we rely experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may\nexperience adverse consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, government enforcement actions\n(for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections), additional reporting requirements or oversight,\nrestrictions on processing data (including personal data), litigation (including class action claims), indemnification obligations,\nnegative publicity, reputational harm, monetary fund diversions, interruptions in our operations (including availability of data to\nus and our customers), financial loss and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may cause\n58\nTable of Contents\ncustomers to stop using our platform, deter new customers for using our platform and negatively impact our ability to grow and\noperate our business.\nOur inability to comply with agreements we enter into with our customers regarding the collection, use, disclosure and other\nprocessing of personal data could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our products.\nWe enter into agreements with our customers regarding our collection, use, disclosure and other processing of personal\ndata in relation to the services we provide to them. Although we endeavor to comply with such agreements, we may at times\nfail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so, including due to the errors or omissions of our personnel and third-\nparty service providers. Such failures or perceived failures can subject us to customer lawsuits, termination of customer\nagreements and governmental enforcement actions. Even if we eventually prevail in any such dispute, resolving them could be\nexpensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity and reputational harm that could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Other Laws and Litigation\nChanges in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in the internet infrastructure itself may diminish the\ndemand for our platform and could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe future success of our business depends upon the continued use of smart cell phones, other mobile devices and\ninternet-connected devices as primary mediums for commerce, communication and business applications. Government bodies\nor agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet and\ninternet-connected devices and cell phones as commercial mediums. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to\nmodify our platform in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may\nbegin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet. These laws or\ncharges could limit the growth of internet-related commerce or communications generally, resulting in reductions in the demand\nfor internet-based solutions such as ours.\nIn addition, the use of the internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or\nadoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease of use,\naccessibility and quality of service. The performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool have been adversely\naffected by “viruses,” “worms” and similar malicious programs, along with distributed denial-of-service and similar attacks. As\na result, the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of such damage to or attacks on portions of\nits infrastructure. If the use of the internet is adversely affected by these issues, demand for our platform could suffer.\nAny future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe have in the past, and may continue in the future to, become subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the\nordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes or employment\nclaims made by our current or former employees. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management’s\nattention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance might\nnot cover such claims, provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more of such claims or continue to be\navailable on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could result in unanticipated\ncosts, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to provide services that our customers can use in compliance with regulations and/or industry standards, our\nrevenue and results of operations could be harmed.\nSince our customers are able to upload data into our platform, we may be hosting or otherwise processing substantial\namounts of personal data. Our cloud platform has completed a SOC 2 Type 2 audit for security, is ISO 27001 certified and is\ndesigned to comply, in all material respects, with various HIPAA standards. Governments and industry organizations may also\nadopt new laws, regulations, rules, certifications, requirements or standards, or make changes to existing laws, regulations,\nrules, requirements or standards, that could impact the demand for, or value of, our platform. If we fail to maintain our current\nsecurity certifications and/or to continue to meet security standards, or if we are unable to adapt our platform to changing legal\nand regulatory standards or other requirements in a timely manner, our customers may lose confidence in our platform, and our\nrevenue, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws\ncan subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the\nU.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the U.K. Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and other anti-corruption laws in countries in which we\n59\nTable of Contents\nconduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit our company from authorizing, offering or\nproviding, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We use third-party\nlaw firms, accountants and other representatives for regulatory compliance, sales and other purposes in several countries. We\ncan be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party representatives, our employees, contractors,\npartners and other agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. In addition, although we have implemented\npolicies and procedures to ensure compliance with anti-corruption laws, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners\nand agents may not comply with these laws at all times.\nNoncompliance with these laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements,\nprosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or\ninjunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm,\nadverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or\nother sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition\nand results of operations could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially\nsignificant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nEnforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, as an issuer of securities, we also are subject to the accounting and internal controls provisions of the FCPA.\nThese provisions require us to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal controls sufficient to detect and\nprevent corrupt conduct. Failure to abide by these provisions may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets\nand subject us to liability if we violate the controls.\nOur platform is subject to U.S. export controls, including the Export Administration Regulations and economic sanctions\nadministered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. We incorporate encryption technology into\nour platform. These encryption products and the underlying technology are currently considered “publicly available” by the\nExport Administration Regulations and may be exported outside of the United States. However, if they cease to be considered\n“publicly available,” then these encryption products and underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States\nonly with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government\nauthorizations.\nFurthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the shipment of\ncertain products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. embargoes or sanctions. Obtaining the\nnecessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be time consuming and may result in the delay or loss\nof sales opportunities even if the export license ultimately may be granted. While we take precautions to prevent our platform\nfrom being exported in violation of these laws, including obtaining authorizations for our platform and performing geolocation\nIP blocking and screenings against United States and other lists of restricted and prohibited persons, we cannot guarantee that\nthe precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws. Additionally, U.S. embargoes and\nsanctions can change rapidly and unpredictably in response to international events, such as the application of new and broad\nsanctions against Russia and Belarus in connection with the invasion of Ukraine. Future embargoes or sanctions could have a\nsignificant impact on our business or the business of our customers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial results and operations. Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control laws can result in incarceration for responsible\nemployees and managers or the imposition of significant fines or penalties.\nIf our partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely\naffected through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties.\nWe presently incorporate export control compliance requirements into our strategic partner agreements, however, our partners\nmay not comply with such requirements.\nVarious countries regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export\nlicensing requirements. Some countries have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit\nour customers’ ability to implement our platform in those countries. Changes in our platform or future changes in export and\nimport regulations may create delays in the introduction of our platform in international markets, prevent our customers with\ninternational operations from launching our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to\ncertain countries, governments or persons altogether. Various governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of\nencryption technology, including the escrow and government recovery of private encryption keys. Any change in export or\nimport regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies\ntargeted by such regulations, could limit our ability to export or sell our platform to existing or potential customers with\ninternational operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\n60\nTable of Contents\nOur international operations may subject us to potential adverse tax consequences.\nWe are expanding our international operations and staff to better support our growth into international markets. Our\ncorporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate future growth into the international markets, and\nconsider the functions, risks and assets of the various entities involved in the intercompany transactions. The amount of taxes\nwe pay in different jurisdictions may depend on (1) the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the\nUnited States, to our international business activities, (2) changes in tax rates, (3) new or revised tax laws or interpretations of\nexisting tax laws and policies and (4) our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and\nintercompany arrangements. Taxing authorities may challenge the pricing methodologies of our intercompany arrangements or\ndisagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a challenge or\ndisagreement were to occur and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and\npenalties. This could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability\nof our operations. Our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of January 31, 2024, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of\napproximately $355.4 million and $248.4 million, respectively, some of which may be available to offset taxable income in the\nfuture, and which expire in various years beginning in 2035 for federal purposes and 2026 for state purposes if not utilized.\nUnder current law, U.S. federal NOLs incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward\nindefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs is limited to 80% of taxable income in tax years beginning after December\n31, 2020. Accordingly, $316.0 million of our NOLs may be carried forward indefinitely for federal tax purposes and various\nstates have enacted tax policies or rules that conform to federal tax laws. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect\nour ability to utilize NOLs incurred in tax years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, before they expire. In general,\nunder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the IRC or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an\n“ownership change” (which generally is defined under Section 382 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations as a\ngreater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period) is subject to limitations on its ability to\nutilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We have experienced ownership changes in the past and we may\nexperience a future ownership change under Section 382 of the Code that could affect our ability to utilize the NOLs to offset\nour income, some of which may be outside of our control. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have\nacquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as\nsuspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to\nreduce future income tax liabilities, including for state tax purposes. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material\nportion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheets, even if we attain profitability, which could potentially result in increased\nfuture tax liability to us and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including:\n• changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have\ndiffering statutory tax rates;\n• expansion to new jurisdictions;\n• changes in tax laws, tax treaties and regulations or the interpretation of them;\n• changes in our assessment of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future\nresults, the advisability and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic and political environments\nin which we do business;\n• the outcome of future tax audits, examinations or administrative appeals; and\n• limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.\nAny of these developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our\ncustomers would have to pay for our products and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAn increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-\nof-state companies. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 2018 in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al,\nor Wayfair, that online sellers can be required to collect sales and use tax despite not having a physical presence in the buyer’s\nstate. In response to Wayfair, or otherwise, state or local governments have adopted and may continue to adopt, or begin to\nenforce, laws requiring us to calculate, collect and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. In addition, we are subject to\nindirect taxes in foreign jurisdictions, such as value-added tax and goods and services tax, in connection with certain foreign\n61\nTable of Contents\nsales transactions. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not\ndo so, or to collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest that we otherwise have not accounted for in our\nfinancial statements. The imposition by tax authorities of indirect tax collection obligations on out-of-jurisdiction sellers also\ncould create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage if similar obligations are not imposed\non our competitors and decrease our future sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or\nerrors or vulnerabilities in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which would\nadversely affect our business.\nOur platform incorporates certain third-party software obtained under licenses from third parties. We anticipate that we\nwill continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools from third parties in the future. Although we believe\nthat there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, including open-source\nsoftware, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to migrate to other third-party software. Our use of\nadditional or alternative third-party software may require us to enter into new license agreements with third parties, which may\nnot be available on as favorable terms as our current licenses. In addition, integration of the third-party software used in our\nsoftware with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and\nresources, or require downtime affecting our service level commitments. Also, any undetected errors, defects or security\nvulnerabilities in third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our software, delay new\nupdates or enhancements to our platform, result in a failure of our platform and injure our reputation.\nWe use open-source software in our products, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our services or subject us to\nlitigation or other actions.\nWe use open-source software in our products, and we expect to continue to incorporate open-source software in our\nservices in the future. Few of the licenses applicable to open-source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk\nthat these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to\ncommercialize our products or to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary source code. Moreover, we may encounter\ninstances in which we have incorporated additional open-source software in our proprietary software in a manner that is\ninconsistent with the terms of the applicable license or our current policies and procedures. While we have adopted guidelines\nfor the appropriate use of, and regularly audit our use of, open-source software, these measures may not always be effective. If\nwe were to combine or link our proprietary software products with open-source software in a certain manner, we could, under\ncertain open-source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software products and allow others to use\nit at no cost. If an author or other third party that distributes such open-source software were to allege that we had not complied\nwith the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against\nsuch allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our products that contained the open-\nsource software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these products, which could disrupt the\ndistribution and sale of these products or put our proprietary source code at risk.\nFrom time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership rights in open-source software against companies\nthat incorporate it into their products and the licensors of such open-source software provide no warranties or indemnities with\nrespect to such claims. As a result, we and our customers could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we\nbelieve to be open-source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our\nproducts. Some open-source projects have known vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities and are provided on an “as-is”\nbasis which, if not properly addressed, could negatively affect the performance of our product. If we inappropriately use or\nincorporate open-source software subject to certain types of open-source licenses that challenge the proprietary nature of our\nproducts, we may be required to re-engineer such products, discontinue the sale of such products or take other remedial actions.\nAny failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual\nproperty. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and\ncontractual protections, all of which provide only limited protection and may not now or in the future provide us with a\ncompetitive advantage.\n62\nTable of Contents\nAs of July 31, 2024, we owned 25 granted patents related to our platform and its technology and had 5 patent\napplications pending for examination in the United States and no non-U.S. patents or patent applications pending. Our patent\napplications may not result in the issuance of a patent, or the examination process may require us to narrow our claims. Any\npatents that issue from any patent applications may not give us the protection that we seek or may be challenged, invalidated or\ncircumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future from our pending or future patent applications may not provide\nsufficiently broad protection and may not be valid and enforceable in actions against alleged infringers or provide us with a\ncompetitive advantage. Any patents we have obtained or may obtain in the future may be found to be invalid or unenforceable\nin light of recent and future changes in the law, or because of technology developed prior to the inventions we have sought to\npatent or because of defects in our patent prosecution process. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO,\nand various foreign governmental patent agencies also require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee\npayment and other similar provisions during the patent application process and after a patent has issued. There are situations in\nwhich noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss\nof patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nWe have registered the “Braze” name, logo, and/or other marks as trademarks in Australia, Canada, EU, Japan, New\nZealand, Singapore, Tonga, United Kingdom, and the United States. However, any pending or future trademark applications\nmay not be approved, and any registered trademarks may not be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary\nrights. The USPTO and various foreign trademark offices also require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary,\nfee payment and other similar provisions during the trademark registration process and after a registration has issued. There are\nsituations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or cancellation of a trademark filing, resulting in partial or\ncomplete loss of trademark rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, our competitors might be able to enter the market\nunder identical or similar brands or we may be forced to abandon marks that we currently rely on.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we also rely on trade secret laws and confidentiality and\ninvention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, strategic partners, vendors and others. Also, despite our\nefforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, copy,\nreverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets. Further,\nthe contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or\nintellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our\nproprietary technology or intellectual property rights. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, trade secrets\nand intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in countries where the laws may not be as\nprotective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual\nproperty rights may be weak. For instance, in response to U.S. sanctions, the Russian government has adopted a decree which\nallows local companies and individuals to use inventions, utility models and industrial designs held by owners from “unfriendly\ncountries” without the owner’s consent and without paying any compensation. If similar policies or laws are adopted in other\njurisdictions, it may be difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights internationally and subject us to material risk of\nunauthorized use of our technologies, trade secrets and intellectual property. As we expand our activities outside of the United\nStates, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our platform and proprietary information may increase. We may be\nunable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use or infringement of our platform, technologies or intellectual property\nrights.\nThe steps that we take may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property, others may\ndevelop or patent similar or superior technologies, products or services, or our trademarks, patents and other intellectual\nproperty may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. Furthermore, effective trademark, patent, copyright and\ntrade secret protection may not be available or commercially feasible in every country in which our software is available or\nwhere we have employees or independent contractors.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and\nprotect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming\nand distracting to management. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses,\ncounterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure,\nprotect and enforce our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our brand and business. An adverse\ndetermination of any litigation proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted\nnarrowly and could put our related patents, patent applications and trademark filings at risk of not issuing or being cancelled.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, some\nof our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. Our inability to\nprotect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our platform, impair the functionality\nof our platform, delay introductions of new functionality to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly\ntechnologies into our platform or injure our reputation. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable\nto enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. If we fail to meaningfully protect our\n63\nTable of Contents\nintellectual property and proprietary rights, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which are extremely costly to defend, could require\nus to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nWe cannot guarantee that the operation of our business does not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nCompanies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own significant\nnumbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of\ninfringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, many of these companies have the capability to\ndedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought\nagainst them. Further, patent litigation may involve patent holding companies, commonly known as patent “trolls,” or other\nadverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenue and against which our patents may therefore provide little or no\ndeterrence. In the past, we have been subject to allegations of patent infringement that were unsuccessful, and we may in the\nfuture be subject to claims that we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties’ intellectual property rights, and, to\nthe extent we gain greater market visibility or face increasing competition, we face a higher risk of being the subject of\nintellectual property infringement claims, which is not uncommon with respect to enterprise software companies. In addition,\nwe may in the future be subject to claims that employees or contractors, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or\ndisclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of our competitors or other parties. Because patent applications can take\nyears to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications,\nunknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products. To the extent that intellectual\nproperty claims are made against our customers based on their usage of our technology, we have certain obligations to\nindemnify and defend such customers from those claims. The term of our contractual indemnity provisions often survives\ntermination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments, defense costs or damage claims from\ncontractual breach could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming, could be expensive to settle or\nlitigate, could divert our management’s attention and other resources and could result in adverse publicity. These claims could\nalso subject us to making substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments and other costs or damages, potentially\nincluding treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. Intellectual property claims could\nalso result in our having to stop making, selling, offering for sale or using technology found to be in violation of a third party’s\nrights. We might be required to seek a license for the third-party intellectual property rights, which may not be available on\nreasonable terms or at all. Even if a license is available to us, we may be required to pay significant upfront fees, milestone\npayments or royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. Moreover, to the extent we only have a license to any\nintellectual property used in our platform, there may be no guarantee of continued access to such intellectual property, including\non reasonable terms. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require\nsignificant effort and expense. If a third party is able to obtain an injunction preventing us from accessing such third-party\nintellectual property rights, or if we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would\nbe forced to limit or stop sales of our products or cease business activities covered by such intellectual property and may be\nunable to compete effectively. Any of these results would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe could face liability, or our reputation might be harmed, as a result of the activities of our customers, the content sent\nthrough our platform or the data they store on our servers.\nAs a provider of cloud-based solutions, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers on or in\nconnection with the content or data they store on or send through our servers. Although our customer terms of use and our\nacceptable use policy, or AUP, prohibit (1) illegal use of our services by our customers, (2) the use of our services for certain\nactivities that do not comply with industry standards and guidelines outlined in our AUP, or (3) the use of our services in any\nmanner that would infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, customers may\nnonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of our agreement, our AUP, applicable\nlaw or the customer’s own policies, which could subject us to liability and/or harm our reputation.\nWe do not typically monitor the content, activities or messages of our customers in connection with their use of our\nservices, so inappropriate content may be sent to third parties, which could subject us to legal liability. Even if we comply with\nlegal obligations to remove or disable certain content, our customers may continue to send messages through our platform that\nthird parties may find hostile, offensive or inappropriate. The activities of our customers or the content of our customers’\nmessages may lead us to experience adverse political, business and reputational consequences, especially if such use is high\nprofile. For instance, if our customers use our platform in violation of law it may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny or\ndirect financial penalties, either of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial results, even if we have\ncomplied with our legal obligations. Conversely, actions we take in response to the activities of our customers or users, up to\nand including suspending their use of our products or services, may harm our brand and reputation.\n64\nTable of Contents\nThere are certain statutory and common law frameworks and doctrines that offer defenses against liability for customer\nactivities, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Communications Decency Act and the fair use doctrine in the\nUnited States and the Electronic Commerce Directive in the European Union. Although these and other statutes and case law in\nthe United States offer certain defenses against liability from customer activities under U.S. copyright law or regarding\nsecondary liability from the Telephone Consumer Protection Act or the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography\nand Marketing Act, they are subject to uncertain or evolving judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments,\nand in any event we cannot assure you that we will be successful in asserting them. In addition, pending or recently adopted\nlegislation in the European Union may impose additional obligations or liability on us associated with content uploaded by\nusers to our platform. Laws governing these activities are unsettled in many international jurisdictions, or may prove difficult or\nimpossible for us to comply with in some international jurisdictions. Even if ultimately resolved in our favor, we may become\ninvolved in related complaints, lawsuits or investigations which add cost to our doing business and may divert management’s\ntime and attention or otherwise harm our reputation.\nOur use of artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning in our platform and our business, as well as our potential\nfailure to effectively implement, use, and market these technologies, may result in reputational harm or liability, or could\notherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe have incorporated and may continue to incorporate AI and machine learning solutions and features, including\ngenerative AI solutions and features, into our platform, and otherwise within our business, and these solutions and features may\nbecome more important to our operations or to our future growth over time. There can be no assurance that the use of AI and\nmachine learning solutions and features will enhance our products or services, produce the intended results, or be beneficial to\nour business, including our efficiency or profitability, and we may fail to properly implement or market our AI and machine\nlearning solutions and features. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI and machine learning tools into their\nproducts, offerings, and solutions more quickly or more successfully than we do, which could impair our ability to compete\neffectively, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, our AI and machine learning solutions and features may expose us to additional claims, demands, and\nproceedings by private parties and regulatory authorities and subject us to legal liability as well as brand and reputational harm.\nThere are significant risks involved in utilizing AI and machine learning technologies, and in particular, generative AI\ntechnologies. For example, AI and machine learning algorithms may be flawed, insufficient, or of poor quality, reflect\nunwanted forms of bias, or contain other errors or inadequacies, any of which may not easily be detectable. AI and machine\nlearning technologies have also been known to produce false or “hallucinatory” inferences or outputs. Further, inappropriate or\ncontroversial data practices by developers and end-users, or other factors adversely affecting public opinion regarding the use of\nAI and machine learning, could impair the acceptance of AI and machine learning solutions, including those incorporated into\nour products and services. If the AI and machine learning tools incorporated into our platform, or the content generated by such\ntools, is harmful, biased, inaccurate, discriminatory or controversial, we could suffer operational efficiencies in addition to\nlegal, competitive and reputational harm, and our customers may be less likely to utilize our AI and machine learning tools or\nmay cease using our platform altogether. If we do not have sufficient rights to use the output of such AI and machine learning\ntools, or the data or other material or content on which the AI and machine learning tools we use rely, we also may incur\nliability through the violation of applicable laws and regulations, third-party intellectual property, privacy or other rights, or\ncontracts to which we are a party.\nIn addition, we are subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal\nliability, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation and AI and machine learning technologies, any of\nwhich could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. The technologies underlying AI and machine\nlearning and their uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations related to online services, intermediary liability,\nintellectual property rights, privacy, data security and data protection, consumer protection, competition and equal opportunity\nlaws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws and regulations.\nAI and machine learning technologies are the subject of ongoing review by various federal, state and foreign governments and\nregulators, which are applying, or are considering applying, their platform moderation, privacy, data security and data\nprotection laws and regulations to such technologies or are considering general legal frameworks for the appropriate use of AI\nand machine learning. As the legal, regulatory, and policy environments around AI and machine learning evolve, we may\nbecome subject to new legal and regulatory obligations in connection with our use of AI and machine learning technology,\nwhich could require us to make significant changes to our policies and practices, necessitating expenditure of significant time,\nexpense, and other resources. We may not be able to anticipate how to respond to rapidly evolving legal frameworks, and we\nmay have to expend resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI and machine learning\nproducts are not consistent across jurisdictions. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI\nand machine learning solutions that we may face, and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations governing the use of AI\nand machine learning solutions may adversely affect our ability to use or sell these solutions or subject us to legal liability.\nRisks Related to Socioeconomic Factors\n65\nTable of Contents\nOur future revenue and results of operations could be harmed if the increases in demand we have seen from certain\nindustries as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic fail to continue over the long term.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments previously instituted shelter-in-place orders, social distancing\nrequirements, travel restrictions and similar measures to slow infection rates. These restrictions prompted shifts from physical\ncommerce to e-commerce, from in-room dining to take out and delivery, from gyms to at home health and fitness and from the\ntheaters to in-home media streaming services. Despite our penetration in these industries that benefited from increased demand\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, this trend may not continue over the long term. Some of our customers may experience\ndecreases or decreased growth rates in transactions, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results\nof operations. We may also experience decreases or decreased growth rates in sales of new subscriptions to some of our\ncustomers, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural catastrophic events and human-made problems such as climate change, power disruptions, computer viruses, global\npandemics, data security breaches and terrorism may disrupt our business.\nWe rely heavily on our network infrastructure and information technology systems for our business operations. An\nonline attack, damage as a result of civil unrest, earthquake, fire, terrorist attack, power loss, global pandemics,\ntelecommunications failures, climate change-related events or other similar catastrophic event could cause system interruptions,\ndelays in accessing our service, reputational harm and loss of critical data. Such events could prevent us from providing our\nplatform and products to our customers. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers, or\nour network infrastructure, or information technology systems, including any errors, defects, or failures in third-party hardware,\ncould affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, many\ncompanies that provide cloud-based services have reported a significant increase in cyberattack activity in recent years. Further,\nevents outside of our control, including natural disasters, climate change-related events, pandemics or health crises may arise\nfrom time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions. Any such events and responses, including regulatory\ndevelopments, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries\nor sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage,\nand may materially and adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as our business and results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to Public Company Reporting and Public Disclosure Practices\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to\nmaintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result,\nthe value of our Class A common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other\nthings, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. This assessment must include\ndisclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In\naddition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we incur substantial expenses and\nexpend significant management efforts. We have hired, and need to continue to hire, additional accounting and financial staff\nwith appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act.\nDuring the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls in future years, if we identify one or more material\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to certify that our internal control over financial\nreporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial\nreporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to\naccurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness\nin our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our\nfinancial reports, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or\ninvestigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict\nour future access to the capital markets.\nWe are subject to risks related to our environmental, social, and governance practices and disclosures.\nThere is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social,\nand governance, or ESG, matters, both in the United States and internationally. Often those stakeholders have differing, and\n66\nTable of Contents\nsometimes conflicting, priorities or requirements regarding ESG matters. The heightened and sometimes conflicting stakeholder\nfocus on ESG issues related to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations,\nstandards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements. Our interpretation or application of such reporting\nrequirements may change over time or differ from other similarly situated companies. Certain organizations also provide ESG\nratings, scores and benchmarking studies that assess companies’ ESG practices. Although there are no universal standards for\nsuch ratings, scores or benchmarking studies, they are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions.\nIt is possible that our future shareholders or organizations that report on, rate or score ESG practices will not be satisfied with\nour ESG strategy or performance. Unfavorable or inaccurate press about ratings or assessments of our ESG strategies or\npractices, regardless of whether or not we comply with applicable legal requirements, may lead to adverse investor sentiment\ntoward us, which in turn could have an adverse impact on our share price, demand for our securities and our access to, and cost\nof, capital.\nIn addition, any of our current or future social impact practices and initiatives could be difficult to achieve and costly to\nimplement. In the event that we publicly disclose, voluntarily or otherwise, certain practices and initiatives regarding ESG\nmatters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such practices or initiatives, or we could be criticized for\nthe scope of such practices or initiatives, which could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain employees or customers\nor reduce the attractiveness of our stock in the investment community. There has also been a recent increase in litigation\nsurrounding ESG practices and related disclosures. For example, there is increased focus by regulators, investors and other\nstakeholders on greenwashing and sustainability-related claims. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to\nallegations or claims associated with our sustainability-related claims or other ESG practices and initiatives.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your\ninvestment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and we do not intend to\npay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the\ndevelopment of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the\ndiscretion of our board of directors and governed by the limitations of any credit agreements we may become party to.\nAccordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as\nthe only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our executive officers,\ndirectors and significant holders of our capital stock, which limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to\ninfluence the outcome of important transactions.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock, which is the stock listed on the\nNasdaq Global Select Market, has one vote per share. As a result, as of July 31, 2024, holders of our Class B common stock\ncollectively beneficially owned, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 71.3% of the voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock, and our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our common stock (by voting\npower) collectively beneficially owned, in the aggregate, outstanding shares representing approximately 76.9% of the total\nvoting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, the holders of our Class B common stock, and in particular our\nexecutive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our common stock (by voting power), will be able to exercise\nconsiderable influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of\nsignificant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, even if their stock holdings\nrepresent less than 50% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock. This concentration of ownership will limit the ability of\nother stockholders to influence corporate matters and may cause us to make strategic decisions that could involve risks to\nholders of our Class A common stock or that may not be aligned with the interests of holders of our Class A common stock.\nThis control may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nFurther, future transfers by holders of our Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into\nshares of our Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for tax or estate planning\npurposes. The conversion of shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock will have the effect,\nover time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long\nterm.\nWe cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure, combined with the concentrated control of certain stockholders,\nincluding our executive officers, employees and directors, investors and their affiliates, will result in a lower or more volatile\nmarket price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index\n67\nTable of Contents\nproviders have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple class share structures in certain of their indexes,\nand our dual class capital structure may make it more difficult for us, or make us ineligible, to be included in certain stock\nindexes. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from\nstock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less\nattractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nAn active public trading market for our Class A common stock may not develop or be sustained.\nPrior to the closing of our initial public offering, no public market for our Class A common stock existed. An active\npublic trading market for our Class A common stock may not continue to develop or, if further developed, it may not be\nsustained. The lack of an active market may impair the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to sell their shares at the\ntime they wish to sell them or at a price that the holders of our Class A common stock consider reasonable. The lack of an\nactive market may also reduce the fair value of shares of our Class A common stock. An inactive market may also impair our\nability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or\ntechnologies by using our shares as consideration.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company\nmore difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of\nour Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, each as currently\nin effect, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Such amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n• authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred\nstock with terms, rights and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our Class A\ncommon stock;\n• require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by\nwritten consent;\n• specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our\nboard of directors or our chief executive officer;\n• establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including\nproposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n• establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n• prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n• provide that our directors may be removed for cause only upon the vote of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares\nof voting stock;\n• provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even\nthough less than a quorum; and\n• require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of voting\nstock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current\nmanagement by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for\nappointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the\nprovisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which generally, subject to certain exceptions,\nprohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested”\nstockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder. Any of\nthe foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A\ncommon stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that holders of our\nClass A common stock would receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock in an acquisition.\nThe provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the Court of Chancery\nin the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect\nof discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation as currently in effect provides that, unless we consent in writing to\nthe selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n• any derivative claim or cause of action brought on our behalf;\n• any claim or cause of action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n• any claim or cause of action against us arising under the DGCL;\n68\nTable of Contents\n• any claim or cause of action arising under or seeking to interpret our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nor our amended and restated bylaws; and\n• any claim or cause of action against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation as currently in effect further provides that, unless we consent in\nwriting to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest\nextent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolutions of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising\nunder the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, including all causes of action asserted against any\ndefendant named in such complaint. The exclusive forum clauses described above shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a\nduty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. For the\navoidance of doubt, this provision is intended to benefit and may be enforced by us, our officers and directors, the underwriters\nto any offering giving rise to such complaint, and any other professional entity whose profession gives authority to a statement\nmade by that person or entity and who has prepared or certified any part of the documents underlying any offering.\nAlthough we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of applicable law\nin the types of lawsuits to which they apply, the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors\nand officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been\nchallenged in legal proceedings, and there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions. In addition,\ninvestors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. It is possible that,\nin connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our\ncurrently effective amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. If so,\nwe may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our Class A common stock\nto decline.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that\nthese sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise\ncapital through the sale of additional equity securities. Many of our existing equity holders have substantial unrecognized gains\non the value of the equity they hold, and therefore they may take steps to sell their shares or otherwise secure the unrecognized\ngains on those shares. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nWe have registered all of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, settlement of\noutstanding restricted stock units, or RSUs, or otherwise issuable pursuant to the terms of the purchase rights under our\nemployee stock purchase plan or any equity incentives we may grant in the future, for public resale under the Securities Act.\nSuch underlying common stock will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent such options or purchase rights\nare exercised or RSUs are settled, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.\nFurther, the holders of Class A and Class B common stock issued in connection with the conversion of our previously\noutstanding convertible preferred stock immediately prior to the completion of our initial public offering have rights, subject to\nsome conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in\nregistration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially as a result of a\nvariety of factors. Factors that may affect the market price of our Class A common stock include:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations;\n• variance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;\n• changes in the prices of our products and services;\n• changes in our projected financial condition and results of operations;\n• changes in laws or regulations applicable to the provision of our products and services or changes that may cause us to\nincur, among other elements, additional or unforeseen expenses associated with regulatory compliance;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions or new offerings;\n• security breaches impacting us or similar companies;\n• our involvement in any material litigation;\n• future sales of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders or our sales of other securities in the future;\n69\nTable of Contents\n• changes in senior management or key personnel;\n• the trading volume of our Class A common stock;\n• changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market;\n• general economic, regulatory and market conditions; and\n• technical factors in the public trading market for our Class A common stock that may produce price movements that\nmay or may not comport with macro, industry, or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the\nsentiment of retail investors, the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in\noptions and other derivatives on our Class A common stock and other technical trading factors.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you of the liquidity of an active trading market, your ability to sell your shares of our\nClass A common stock when desired, or the prices that you may obtain for your shares of our Class A common stock. The lack\nof an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider\nreasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our\nability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or\ntechnologies by using our shares as consideration.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the\nmarket prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the\noperating performance of those companies. Additionally, the recent and acute volatility among certain financial institutions\nhave raised questions regarding the stability of the banking sector and, while such volatility has not adversely affected our\noperations, it has had an adverse impact on the equity and credit markets. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as\ngeneral economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common\nstock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to\nsecurities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial\ncosts and divert our management’s attention.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans\nor otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to\ngrant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our equity incentive plans and purchase rights to our\nemployees under our employee stock purchase plan. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part\nof our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services or technologies and issue equity\nsecurities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders\nto experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Class A common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish negative reports about our\nbusiness, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry\nanalysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If our financial performance fails to\nmeet analyst estimates or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares,\nour share price would likely decline. Our business results may vary significantly from such analyst estimates or any analyst\nconsensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including due to the global economic\nuncertainty and financial market conditions, including as a result of global or domestic macroeconomic and socioeconomic\nconditions such as, among others, instability in the banking and financial services sector, international and domestic supply\nchain risks, inflationary pressure, interest rate increases, declines in consumer confidence, international conflicts and domestic\nand foreign political unrest, that impact us and our customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand results of operations. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on\nus, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nThe following sets forth information regarding all of our unregistered securities sold in the fiscal quarter ended July 31,\n2024:\n• On May 1, 2024, we issued 32,155 shares of our Class A common stock to a charitable donor-advised fund\nfor no consideration in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as\nthis issuance did not involve a public offering.\nUse of Proceeds\n70\nTable of Contents\nNot applicable.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\n(a)\nOn September 4, 2024, the compensation and leadership development committee of our board of directors amended and\nrestated the Company’s executive severance plan, or the Severance Plan, applicable to certain employees of the Company,\nincluding the Company’s named executive officers, in connection with a periodic review of the Severance Plan.\nThe Severance Plan was amended and restated to include (a) an amendment to the definition of “Cause” to clarify that\nCause for a Covered Employee (as defined in the Severance Plan) includes the Covered Employee’s (i) gross negligence or\ngross misconduct in the performance of the Covered Employee’s employment duties; (ii) refusal or willful failure to\nsubstantially perform his or her duties to the Company; (iii) dishonesty, willful misconduct, misappropriation, breach of\nfiduciary duty or fraud with regard to the Company or its Affiliates (as defined in the Severance Plan); (iv) violation of a\nconfidentiality, non-solicitation, non-competition, or non-disparagement obligation to the Company, whether pursuant to\nagreement, policy, or otherwise; (v) improper disclosure of proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company’s business;\n(vi) falsification of any records or documents of the Company; (vii) material non-compliance with a law or regulatory rule\napplicable to the Company’s business or any Company policy; (viii) indictment for a felony or crime involving moral turpitude;\n(ix) engagement in behavior that poses a likely and substantial risk of harm to the reputation of the Company or puts the\nCovered Employee at material risk of being prohibited from working for the Company; or (x) other willful or grossly negligent\naction that is materially harmful to the business, interests or reputation of the Company, (b) clarification that, in connection with\nan Involuntary Termination (as defined in the Severance Plan), a Tier 2 Covered Employee (as defined in the Severance Plan)\nshall be entitled to cash severance equal to the greater of the amounts due under the Severance Plan or under the Braze, Inc.\nemployee severance plan for U.S. employees, and (c) the addition of an obligation to resolve any disputes under the Severance\nPlan by arbitration.\nThe foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text\nof the Severance Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by this reference.\n(b)\nOn June 14, 2024, Jonathan Hyman, our Chief Technology Officer, modified a trading plan intended to satisfy the\naffirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The trading plan was originally adopted on\nDecember 29, 2023, and, as modified, provides for the sale of, in the aggregate, up to 217,000 shares of our Class A common\nstock, subject to the satisfaction of specified price conditions. The plan will terminate on December 31, 2024, subject to early\ntermination for certain specified events set forth in the plan.\nOn July 25, 2024, Phillip Fernandez, a member of our board of directors, terminated a trading plan intended to satisfy the\naffirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The trading plan was previously adopted on April 7,\n2024 and provided for the sale of, in the aggregate, up to 120,000 shares of our Class A common stock, subject to the\nsatisfaction of specified price conditions.\nItem 6.

We were very pleased with our second quarter results, which again demonstrated the high ROI\nand long-term value of the Braze customer engagement platform, along with strong execution from our teams around the world. We were\nencouraged by the new business one in the quarter, the progress made in our product investments and the continued development of our AI\ninitiatives.\nWe generated $145.5 million of revenue, up 26% year-over-year, while driving continued efficiency across our business. Non-GAAP gross margin\nwas 70.9%, a rise of 90 basis points compared to the previous year, and we demonstrated strong operating leverage, realizing our first-ever quarter\nof non-GAAP operating income profitability and non-GAAP net income profitability.\nWe take pride in achieving these milestones and look forward to continuing to grow our business efficiently in the coming quarters and years,\ngenerating more meaningful non-GAAP operating income and free cash flow for shareholders while also thoughtfully reinvesting in our business.\nWe've highlighted the legacy vendor replacement cycle and point solution consolidation trends over the last few quarters, and we're excited to\nsee those trends continue as marketers realize that the antiquated technology and silo architectures of the legacy marketing clouds and e-mail\nservice providers are unsuited for modern engagement use cases.\nCustomer growth in the quarter was solid, with our customer count reaching 2,163, an increase of 61 during the quarter and 205 year-over-year.\nNew business wins and upsells included Asiana Airlines, Bell Media, Gumtree, Loan Depot, N26, Papa John's Pizza, Strawberry Hotels, Supercell,\nTF1, Zalando and many others.

And now I'll turn the call over to Isabelle.\nIsabelle Winkles - Braze Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Bill, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Bill stated, we reported a solid second quarter with revenue increasing 26%\nyear-over-year to $145.5 million, driven by a combination of existing customer contract expansions, renewals and new business. Subscription\nrevenue remains the primary component of our total top line, contributing 96% of our second quarter revenue, while the remaining 4% represents\na combination of recurring professional services and onetime configuration and onboarding fees.\nTotal customer count increased 10% year-over-year to 2,163 customers as of July 31, up 205 from the same period last year and up 61 from the\nprior quarter. Our total number of large numbers, which we define as those spending at least $500,000 annually, grew 28% year-over-year to 222.\nAnd as of July 31, contributed 61% to our total ARR. This compares to a 57% contribution as of the same quarter last year.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Expansion\nwas again broadly distributed across industries and geographic regions. Revenue outside the US contributed 5% to our total revenue in the second\nquarter compared to 43% in the prior year quarter and 44% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nIn the second quarter, our total remaining performance obligation was $690 million, up 32% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Current RPO\nwas $438 million, up 24% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increases were driven by contract renewals and upsells and\nthe signing of new customer contracts. Overall, our dollar-weighted contract length remains at just over two years.\nNon-GAAP gross profit in the quarter was $103 million, representing a non-GAAP gross margin of 70.9%. This compares to a non-GAAP gross profit\nof $81 million and non-GAAP gross margin of 70% in the second quarter of last year. The year-over-year margin improvement was primarily driven\nby the continued cost optimization of our technology stack with additional benefits from personnel efficiencies.\nNon-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $58 million or 40% of revenue, compared to $52 million or 45% of revenue in the prior year quarter.\nWhile the dollar increase reflects our year-over-year investment in headcount to support our ongoing global growth and expansion, the improved\nefficiency reflects our disciplined investment approach to resource deployment across our go-to-market organization.\nNon-GAAP R&D expense was $21 million or 15% of revenue, compared to $19 million or 16% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The dollar increase\nwas primarily driven by increased headcount costs to support the expansion of our existing offerings as well as to develop new products and\nfeatures to drive growth.\nNon-GAAP G&A expense was $19 million or 13% of revenue, compared to $17 million or 15% of revenue in the prior year quarter. While the dollar\nincrease was driven investments to support our overall company growth, the improved efficiency continues to reflect our disciplined approach to\ninvestment and resource deployment as we continue to scale.\nNon-GAAP operating income was $4.2 million or 3% of revenue compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $7.6 million or 7% of revenue in the\nprior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Braze shareholders in the quarter was $9.1 million or $0.09 per share compared to a loss\nof $3.9 million or a loss of $0.04 per share in the prior year quarter.\nNow turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with $504 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and\nmarketable securities. Cash provided by operations during the quarter was $11.6 million compared to cash used of $17.5 million in the prior year\nquarter. This marks our third straight quarter of positive operating cash flow.\nIncluding the impact of capitalized costs, free cash flow in the second quarter was approximately $7.2 million compared to negative free cash flow\nof $18.7 million in the prior year quarter. And as we have noted in the past, we expect our free cash flow to continue to fluctuate from\nquarter-to-quarter given the timing of customer and vendor payments.\nNow turning to guidance. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $147.5 million to $148.5 million, which\nrepresents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 19% at the midpoint. Third quarter non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the\nrange of $3.5 million to $4.5 million. At the midpoint, this implies an operating margin of approximately negative 2.5%.\nThird quarter operating income will be affected by the cost of Forge, our annual customer conference, as well as several global customer events\nscheduled during the quarter. Taken together, these events will impact the third quarter operating expenses by an estimated $5 million to $6\nmillion.\nIn addition, the back half of the year will be impacted by our midyear compensation and promotion cycle, for which comp increases were effective\nAugust 1. Third quarter non-GAAP net loss is expected to be $0.5 million to $1.5 million, and third quarter non-GAAP net loss per share in the range\nof zero cents to a loss of $0.01 per share based on approximately 102 million weighted average basic shares outstanding during the period.\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of $7.5 million to $8.5 million.\nAt the midpoint, this implies a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately negative 1%, a roughly 750 basis point improvement versus fiscal\nyear 2024. Non-GAAP net income for the same period is expected to be in the range of $6.5 million to $7.5 million. Fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP net\nincome per share is expected to be $0.06 to $0.07 per share based on a full year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 108 million\nshares.\nI'll end by reiterating Braze's commitment to providing world-class customer engagement solutions while effectively managing cost to its share\nprofitability targets.\nAnd with that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nRyan MacWilliams, Barclays.\nRyan MacWilliams - Barclays - Analyst\nThanks for the taking the question. Bill, with Apple supporting RCS in iOS 18, have you seen any customer interest yet on RCS? And how could you\nsee this as a channel for Braze since RCS seems more complex than SMS and it has the ability to be more personalized for individual users? Thanks.\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So first, we're excited for RCS and actively preparing full support, and we're excited to share more about that at Forge in just a few weeks. Some\naspects of RCS are going to be strictly better than SMS sending even for text-only messages. And so I think that's something that will really help\nmarketers work through some of the additional complexity is that they can just lift and shift prior SMS strategies. And then they're actually get\naccess to authentication and branding as a sender, they're going to get richer analytics.\nAnd then they'll also then be able to progressively leg into these new content types. And while there's got work to do on the Braze side both for\nops because like SMS and carrier ops because of the carrier complexity, and on the go-to-market side, as we ingest what surely is going to be a\ndynamic pricing environment in the early innings of RCS's global rollout.\nMost of the R&D needs to support things like composition, previewing, testing and reporting on RCS have already been done in some fashion, due\nto our support of WhatsApp, line or other Braze zone and operated channels like content cards and in product messaging. And similarly, for any\ncustomers that are already adopting richer content formats, even if they're just in push notifications, but obviously also with WhatsApp in line. The\nshift over to RCS a lot\nAnd from an R&D perspective, it obviously increases the leverage that we get on that investment. And as a good reminder, the compounding\nbenefits that Braze grants of channel support provides us as the consumer message sending landscape continues to grow more complex over\ntime.\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

So if you remember, until the end of Q1, we actually used to require\nthat customers made commitments on a country-by-country basis for SMS and MMS sending separately.\nNow any customer who's actually bought the credits from Braze starting at the end of Q1 and then into Q2 where we saw a great uptake on that,\nboth for renewals as well as new business. We'll be able to use those same credits just with conversion ratios as RCS support becomes available.\nSo that's definitely something to look forward to as Braze continues to launch new channels into the future, including RCS, is that the go-to-market\ncomplexity and the ability for our existing customer base to adopt them quickly to be able to as any sort of stage that involves new contracting.\nRyan MacWilliams - Barclays - Analyst\nExcellent. Appreciate the color. Then for Isabelle, how should we think about member retention for the rest of this year? Do you feel like we're at\nthe right level at this point? And was there any impact to this metric based on the acquisition from a year ago? Thanks a lot.\nIsabelle Winkles - Braze Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So thanks for the question. So I've been asked this question over the last couple of quarters of sort of when can we see the bottom here. And\nI think we're not quite yet at the bottom. And as you think about how we're guiding. Think about the guide as embedding some element of kind\nof continued pressure on this metric.\nSo I don't think we are quite stabilizing here yet. We lagged out of sort of another quarter historically that had some stronger numbers. And so\nthat's part of it, is continuing to leg out of some of these stronger historical quarters. Not a huge impact here from the acquisition, small percentage\npoints, from the impact of having lapped the acquisition, but really more just lagging out of historically stronger quarters.\nRyan MacWilliams - Barclays - Analyst\nMake sense. Appreciate the color, thanks.\nOperator\nPinjalim Bora, JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora - JPMorgan Chase & Co - Analyst\nThanks for taking the question. Bill, maybe you touched on the legacy Marketing Cloud replacement cycle. Maybe talk about how often is AI or\nyour road map around AI has been cited by customers in these deals as kind of a point of differentiation? And is the intensity there in terms of the\ndisplacement cycle? Are you seeing that increase recently or are people holding on more to their incumbent solution given the challenging macro?\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So I think we're seeing both attitudes depending on the posture of the company that we're working with or selling to. In some places, there\nare especially driven by things like vendor consolidation as well as just a bit of breathing room from slower growth rates that companies are\nexperiencing right now.\nThey're taking as an opportunity to go and shore up their prior foundations, embark transformation journeys, in other places because the teams\nare static or there's not new projects launching and such, they're sticking with the status quo. And so I think you're seeing both of them at play.\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

When you're going through a legacy replacement, you\nobviously want to make sure that the vendor that moving on to is going to be future-proofed as well, especially if you're a more traditional enterprise,\nit maybe only makes a change in their technology stack like this every 5 or 10 years.\nAnd so there's a bit of a double-edged sword there in the sense that there's obviously still a lot of noise in the AI space, and it's an important part\nof every deal cycle, but customers are still in prospects still have a hard time getting full conviction behind it.\nThere's a lot of great product marketing around AI from the legacy clouds and being able to see what's real from what's noise. Still very difficult for\na lot of prospects and we take that on to try to take a very pragmatic approach and a very transparent approach about what's possible, what's not,\nwhere our advantages are we work through that with customers.\nAnd so I think it's a complicated landscape. But I think that when we look at the long-term legacy replacement cycle, what we're seeing is there's\nno meaningful new innovation or investment really going into any of these legacy Marketing Cloud offerings that compete specifically with Braze.\nTheir eye seems to be off the ball on this from a marketing and customer engagement space, and they don't have the right foundations to be able\nto compete with us over the longer term.\nWe still see them leveraging things like their ecosystem relationships through places like the GSIs or with aggressive pricing tactics. But we feel\nreally good about our position against legacy marketing cloud especially as -- we continue to look at the advantages that we have in AI adoption\nand AI development because of our stronger foundations around real-time capability, around our comprehensive data ingestion, governance and\nmanagement that we have through the Braze data platform and also the comprehensive touch points that we have across all of our channel breadth\nin order to, and take the outcomes of those decisions that are being made with AI and bring them to life for the customer.\nPinjalim Bora - JPMorgan Chase & Co - Analyst\nUnderstood. Thank you very much. One question for Isabelle. And maybe you as well, Bill. Maybe talk about the macro environment tactically\nversus business last quarter. When I look at the numbers, it seems like NRR took a bigger step down this quarter sequentially. Some of the bookings\nnumbers RPO-based, CRPO-based seems like slowed a bit. So wanted to hear if the macro environment, do you feel like it took a step down?\nOr are there some other dynamics maybe Isabelle can talk about on the deferred revenue side, which kind of sequentially seems like it's more of\na drag down this quarter than previous Q2?\nIsabelle Winkles - Braze Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Yeah, absolutely. So on the RPO, CRPO, the thing to keep in mind is we -- there having lapped the acquisition that is having an impact. So\nhaving lapped the North Star acquisition, you can see that in the RPO and CRPO. In addition, from a dollar-based net retention perspective, as I\nmentioned in the previous question that I answered, legged out of some sort of higher numbers that you're seeing from historical quarters that\nare rolling off.\nAnd then from a billings perspective and in particular, the deferred revenue that you've specifically asked about, this metric is impacted by the\ncontracting terms that we have with our customers, which is why it's a noisy metric, and we don't typically point people to it.\nAnd so one quarter ago, we had a bit of a dip in the proportion of our net new business that was on annual upfront terms, which means the invoices\nthat went out during Q2 are arguably smaller, not because the contract is necessarily smaller, but because it's more divided up into smaller\nincrements. And so you're seeing that play out in the change in deferred revenue on the balance sheet.\nPinjalim Bora - JPMorgan Chase & Co - Analyst\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Thank you. Maybe I'll ask the normalized growth question, which is let's assume we're in a similar macro environment. How do\nyou think about some of the company-specific initiatives that you're introducing the start-ups in free trial? And then the sales and marketing\nproductivity improvements you're making. If you think about everything in our gate, how do you think about the potential for the business to\nreaccelerate over, let's say, the next 12 to 18 months? Thank you.\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, thanks. Great question, and we're thinking a lot about the businesses, acquisition efficiency across the different sectors in what you're seeing\nin releases like the Braze for startups as well as broadly the building that we've been doing under the product-led growth umbrella, is really looking\nat the business over the long term and saying that we think we have a strong right to win in the commercial segments.\nIf you recall actually if you go back 12 months ago, we did do a reduction in the cyber sales team and a lot of that was focused on the SMB and the\ncommercial side. We've since started to grow that capacity again. It's been a little bit more focused in the enterprise where we feel good about the\nacquisition efficiency that we've achieved there. And we obviously continue to lean into that, and that's why you're seeing the great operating\nincome and net income results this quarter and the trajectory that we've been on there.\nBut when we look at the SMB and the commercial side, we think there's also a strong right to win in that market. And additionally achieving higher\njust sheer volume of customers as well as higher levels mind share and the two goals that I referenced in the prepared remarks about making Braze\nthe premier skill set for customer engagement, and being the reference architecture from a technical perspective.\nThose are both goals that we think will lead to category dominance for Braze. It leads to a lot of amazing positive feedback loops in terms our\necosystem, being able to support our future growth in a more efficient way, leading to more brand preference and skill set preference within the\ncustomer engagement practitioner community.\nAnd so what you're seeing within those investments that we're making right now is that we're taking advantage of this time period, even though\nthe demand environment is challenged even though the macro is in a challenging place, there's a lot of scrutiny on spend to really improve the\nefficiency in our foundations, and set the right stage to build those long-term competitive moats around our ecosystem, around the skill set and\naround our product advantage as well, obviously, as we continue to invest heavily in R&D.\nAnd so we think that the ingredients are there across both places where we have Frontier investment. And you're seeing that frontier investment\nas we continue to push into both like literal frontiers with new geographies as well as penetrate more deeply various verticals, in particular, in the\nenterprise is we're focusing in places like travel and hospitality and financial services and looking at retail and commerce.\nAnd so what you're seeing from Braze right now is a strong balancing of looking at the places that we have strength right now in order to drive\nefficient acquisition of new business, that allows us to simultaneously achieve our goals of growth and profitability while also making foundational\ninvestments to improve our future acquisition efficiency that will allow for us to achieve category dominance in customer engagement.\nWe know that now is not the right time to be drastically expanding an SMB sales team as an example, but being able to build out improved efficiency\nin that space through investments in product-led growth motions, the free trials have been super important.\n10\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

That makes a lot of sense. And Bill, maybe on the question up Frontiers, and specifically on product frontiers, remind us a little bit on how\nyou're thinking about the next milestones on the product road map. Not just in your core market of marketing, but also maybe more broader than\nthat. How do you think about your journey to being even more dominant across adjacent categories over the long run as well? Thank you.\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So first, I'd say in the short term, I'm just going to give another preview that we're really looking forward to Forge in a few weeks to share a\nlot more about the product road map. At a high level, I'm really excited about our continued leadership in the customer engagement category.\nThe compounding gains that we're achieving as we've simultaneously expanded and enhanced our channel offerings, while also increasing the\nsophistication and usability, higher up the stack.\nAnd when we combine that with the Braves data platform and augment it with our partner ecosystem, I think this is continuing to deliver more\ncapability to be more broadly integrated into our customers’ technical ecosystem to be trusted for a more workloads.\nToday, obviously, those continue to be focused within customer engagement. But customer engagement also very broad. And even in these\ncustomers that -- we've grown a big contract over the last couple of quarters we've talked about. Even within those customers, we still don't own\nevery customer touch point.\nAnd so I think there's a lot of room for us to continue to run when it comes to customer engagement. I think it's also important to remember that\nthe definition of customer engagement as a category has grown and expanded each year of our history. It obviously didn't exist when we first\nstarted, and has continued to take on more and more responsibility, more aspects of the product journey, more aspects of -- obviously, there's the\nmarketing journey looking at things like performance marketing.\nAnd then just having data and optimization and the delivery of the experience and the brand promise stores and so continuing to build on the\nperformance the stability and the reliability of Braze's underlying engine is exactly what it will take for us to have that right to expand into other\naspects of enterprise workloads.\nAnd we're really excited about what that means for our longer-term future potential. But we also have amazing line of sight to incredible growth,\nI think, still within customer engagement.

Hi. Thank you. Bill, for you. Can you touch on the Braze data platform and the role you think it might end up playing in just delivering\nadditional value to customers? And how you might end up monetizing that and for customers that have existing cloud data warehouses? Is this\nmeant to be a replacement? Is it complementary to that? Like what role does it frame the overarching data stack for your customers?\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So we launched the Braze data platform to serve as a platform for continued development of both our in-house data capabilities and the\npartner ecosystem that enhances them. And so the goal is to ensure that all data relevant to the targeting orchestration, personalization or\nmeasurement of customer messaging can get to Braze quickly, completely and with a low total customer ownership.\nAnd so those three things quickly, completely low total cost of ownership have driven our decision-making around what we build in-house, where\nwe go to the partner ecosystem, and then how we kind of interact with the architectures of our customers, which includes like data warehouses,\nCDPs, reverse ETL providers, product analytics companies, et cetera. And you can see examples of partners across all those categories within the\ndata platform launch.\nNow in order to achieve those goals across a wide range of customers requires a data platform that's simultaneously flexible and powerful while\nalso being comprehensive and well integrated. And so I think that when you look at the data platform today, it's not only comprehensive. It's been\ngrowing very quickly. It's been adapting really well to changes to the privacy and the security and the governance ecosystem.\nIt's also been growing and developing as we continue to see things like the rise of the data science teams and the closer integrations that they\nhave with customer engagement teams, moving far beyond just an analyst looking at basic reporting, which you would have expected, something\nlike a Marketing Cloud to deliver years ago and really moving into teams where there's full on data science teams that are working with advanced\nstatistical and machine learning models in order to enhance outcomes and continue to drive better personalization or better audience building\nor what have you.\nBut that ultimately, when we look at Braze's position in that value stack, we know that value is generated the interactions with the customers. And\nthat's where we're going to continue to focus our pricing as we share in the value that we create for the brands that we work with when they\nimprove the value of their customer relationships.\nAnd so I think that we broadly see the data platform is in service to the customer engagement outcomes that we are driving for our customers.\nAnd there are aspects of it that obviously get charged for, things like our product catalogs and the advanced AI features that we're building on top\nof that through things like our predictive churn models, as well as item recommendations that build on top of the product catalogs.\nBut a really big goal of the data platform is to make sure that you can get data into Braze quickly completely and with the low total cost of ownership.\nAnd when that happens, customers adopt new use cases in Braze more quickly, they expanded new channels more comprehensively, and that\ncontinues to drive increases in their lifetime contract value and increases their stickiness with Braze.\nArjun Bhatia - William Blair - Analyst\nOkay. Helpful. And then when I look at your results, I think it seems like the enterprise is doing very well. We're getting more and more eight figure\ncustomers, your primary care customers are going up and there seem to be maybe some headwinds out in the business.\n12\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Like how are you thinking about that internally to maximize your\ngrowth potential in this macro environment?\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So I just spoke about this about that balance of pre-existing acquisition efficiency with investing into new frontiers that will give us new\nopportunities and strong depth and new opportunities as we move into future years, as well as investments that will foundationally, we think,\nimprove the acquisition and see in other places.\nNow acquisition efficiency has historically been stronger in our enterprise business. And while we've obviously been investing to make further\nimprovements in that sector, and you see that in our improvements in profitability, we also think that there's a function changes and efficiency\nthat are available to us on the lower end, and we're excited about that for our future. We've actually had a year-long focus area in product around\nproduct-led growth efforts.\nAnd you've heard me reference things like usability improvements and customer education, you obviously saw the launch of the trial. And while\nwe're still far from something like a self-serve credit card sign-up offering, we are making incremental steps that are compatible with our existing\ngo-to-market engine we think are going to provide structural improvements to our efficiency there.\nI also wanted to just call out that while the kind of free trial environment has an obvious benefit in the SMB side, that it's also important to remember\nthe existence of something like a sandbox or a trial environment are increasingly table stakes for evaluations with technical stakeholders.\nAnd so if you go to that second goal I mentioned before for category dominance of being the reference architecture from a technical perspective\nfor customer engagement, as well as understanding that those technical stakeholders are almost always involved in enterprise buying cycles, and\nthat has an important interplay with the current demand environment.\nYou've heard us mention many times that deal scrutiny is higher in this macro, there's more stakeholders. And frequently, what that means is that\nthey're technical stakeholders. Similarly, in order to win something where you have a vendor consolidation play or a legacy replacement cycle that\nalso involves those technical stakeholders. And they're simply not interested in sticking to the legacy enterprise sales model that disallowed kicking\nthe tires before a contract was signed.\nAnd so Braze's product historically has not made that available. And in many ways, the legacy marketing clouds do not either. But we know that\nBraze's product has the technical excellence to satisfy those stakeholders. But we historically haven't had a great way to prove that to them and\nnow we do.\nSo we're excited about what that means to our ability to differentiate in sales cycles against copycat competitors who've created shallow copies\nof us. And that ability to go deeper than the demo and slide decks, we think, is a really great advantage for us. Because we've always lived by the\nadage of doing what you say you're going to do.\nAnd we think that the speed, the reliability and the performance that Braze delivers is -- we do what it says on the tin, if you will, pick your analogy,\nI think that we're just reliable, and we have got a lot of integrity in what we sell and how we position it. And this is something that will only help\nus when we both look at it from a multiple stakeholder buying cycle in the enterprise as well as that volume play on the lower end and achieving\nstructural improvement and acquisition efficiency within the commercial segments.\nArjun Bhatia - William Blair - Analyst\nAll right. That’s it. Thank you.\n13\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Thanks for taking the question. A couple of follow-ups, actually, Bill, to some of the answers you just gave As I think about kind of the\npositioning for Braze, like in many ways, I think of you guys is acting a lot like a CDP for customers, right? Just kind of obviates the need for a\nthird-party vendor to be in there. But then I hear the list of like the launch partners for the data platform, and there are a number of CDP guys in\nthere.\nCan you just help me anything like when a customer might need a CDP? When they might not like what dictates that difference? I mean, I would\nthink that CDP what might be one of those point solutions that you guys could consolidate. So just help me think through that?\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So I think that it's important to realize how when thinking through that, how diversified Braze's customer base is and that applies across\nverticals, across geos, across levels of position, but also across the technical ecosystems that we integrate into. And if you take a step back from\nthe use case of a CDP. In many cases, what it's trying to do is clean up the complexity of a data ecosystem.\nAnd there's a lot of places where that complexity can come from. Maybe people are trying to sync together a lot of third-party data sources that\nare coming in with less than deterministic identity. They're trying to bring in audience and cookie data, maybe they've got holistic-based matching\nor other of data science and machine learning groups that are doing probabilistic targeting and things like that. And those are all kind of data\nsignals that can, in many ways, pollute a first-party data set, and it's helpful to have a separate to be able to keep those things managed and\nseparated.\nSimilarly, if you look at within the retail space or within QSR, a lot of times, there might be kind of legacy deployments of old POS systems that are\nnot going to be upgraded for a very long time. Maybe there's old part of a data warehousing ecosystem or a lot of heterogeneity across technology\nchoices being made across the multinational, those are all places where complexity can come into a data ecosystem.\nAnd a CDP, whether it's one off the shelf and one of the ones that we've highlighted as partners or it's something that a company would call a CDP\nand build on their own on top of AWS services or on top of data warehouses like Snowflake or Databricks or what have you, at the end of the day,\nwhat it's trying to do is kind of manage and clean up complexity.\nAnd so there's a lot that the Braves data platform can do to help manage that complexity within the customer engagement sphere. But there's also\na lot of other operations and kind of responsibilities that exist across products and customers support and across other areas of performance\nmarketing and such, where the Braze data platform doesn't aim to kind of fully integrate in all those places as well as just the simple reality that a\nlot of these -- a lot of the data ecosystem has a high level of stickiness.\nAnd in many cases, it's better to be able to adapt and connect to those so that we can get data into Braze completely reliably, low total cost of\nownership. I went back to those goals. We want to make sure that those things are accomplished, so that can deliver messages to customers and\nso that they can be well personalized.\nAnd so that they can be highly responsive to new user actions or changes in the context around them, changes in inventory or what have you, we\nwant to be able to just get that data into Braze, as it's generated, as it changes so that we can act on those insights.\n14\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

At the end of the day, what we want to do is deliver great customer experiences\nand be able to really own this customer engagement space. And that data platform is a very important aspect of that, but so is the partner ecosystem.\nDJ Hynes - Canaccord Genuity - Analyst\nYeah. Okay. That makes a ton of sense. That's a helpful explanation. And then just going back to the free trial, like can you give me some color on\nthe depth of platform capabilities that a trial customer might be realized in 14 days? I mean it's a narrow window. When you talk about technical\ndecision makers, just trying to think about the potential effectiveness of that program?\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So we've already been seeing this actually because we had -- before the launch of the free trial what we refer to as a guided sandbox experience,\nwhich has allowed for technical teams to go in and build implementations against our APIs, ensure that our SDKs are going to work within their\nproduct, be able to just send test messages and test things end to end. I think this is a competitive space where there's a lot of noise, there's a lot\nof copycats out there. It's easy to copy product marketing. And there's just not a lot of trust for technical teams buying marketing software.\nAnd so what this is, is we're really just saying, hey, we stand behind that this product does what we say it's going to do. And that there's strong\nintegrity and reliability and high performance available. It's pretty easy for people to say that something is real time. And when we look at the\ndefinition of real time across the environment, it varies from milliseconds to 24 hours. In terms of what people say, and a lot of times a lot of our\ncompetition have a totally different latency depending on what part of the product you're using as an example.\nAnd I think that all buyers have just had a hard time getting conviction, especially when you have a premium price product like Braze does. And\nother people can easily kind of clone our messaging that just letting the product stand on its own has really benefited in particular, those technical\nstakeholders are evaluating the product.\nAnd it's not that you need to run a long-running campaign over the course of 60 days and prove to yourself that SMS marketing works or something\nlike that as an example. I think that customers, in general, understand the value of these channels, it's really about through the noise that's in the\ncompetitive marketplace and us being able to really just show it to them instead of needing to do these things that are higher lips with our solutions\nconsultants or with things like guided sandboxes and what have you, we're really just letting the product shine on its own.\nDJ Hynes - Canaccord Genuity - Analyst\nYeah. Very clear. Okay, great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nTyler Radke, Citi.\nAshley Kim - Citigroup - Analyst\nHi, thank you. This is Ashley Kim on for Tyler. Maybe a question for Isabelle. On the gross margins, apart from the personnel and tech stack efficiencies,\nwould there be anything call-out?

Thanks for the question. So if we rewind the clock to Q1, we had mentioned that we were experiencing a bit of a low for the year in Q1 related\nprimarily to some concentration of premium message volume that was happening during that quarter. So what I would say is the achievement\nthat we had in Q2 in terms of I think we definitely overachieved even on sort of our own internal expectations, and we're very, very pleased with\nhow quickly we were able to capitalize on some of the efficiencies that we put in. So what I mentioned in Q1 is look for us to kind of increase\nquarter-over-quarter.\nI think that the achievement that we have in Q2 here has surpassed that. And so while we believe that everything that we've put into place is\nsustainable, I would not look for that number to continue to increase certainly at the same clip that we experienced sequentially from Q1 to Q2.\nSo I definitely think about that in the context of the models that you put into place. But we're very pleased with the results that we had vis-a-vis\nthe margin improvement between Q1 and Q2.\nAshley Kim - Citigroup - Analyst\nAll right, thank you. I’ll go back in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator\nScott Berg, Needham & Company.\nScott Berg - Needham & Company - Analyst\nHi, everyone. Nice quarter here. Bill, you mentioned very briefly, I think it was to Ryan's question about your new credit strategy within premium\nmessaging platforms. It's only been a couple of months since you made that change. I guess what are you seeing across buyer behavior in trying\nto buy and hopefully expand channel usage into different countries so far with the new strategy?\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I would say that other than some of the noise that you would expect just in the early innings of it as we had some deal cycles where people\nwere already projecting their country volumes, then we showed up with a new credit model to be able to sell them, and the training that we had\nto do for our go-to-market organization and such that those -- that little bit of noise, notwithstanding that it's just been great to well received by\ncustomers.\nI think it's a win-win-win change for us, and I've been really happy that we've been able to deploy more quickly. Even more excited about the fact\nthat as we launch new channels moving into the future, and I mentioned RCS, WhatsApp is obviously going to be changing. We talked a lot about\nthat on the last quarter's call, the bringing line into general availability.\nWe've got active centers doing that sending line messages in Japan and beta right now, and so we're excited for that to launch. All these things\njust get easier launch. They're easier to sell as we move into the flexible credits model.\nWe also think that it's going to be beneficial from an unused entitlements perspective, we've spoken the last few quarters about how one of the\nsources turn that we've seen is that a lot of the contracts, particularly those that were signed during the zero interest rate environment included\nentitlements that were purchased with very optimistic or like kind of aggressive purchasing of entitlements that people have been rightsizing.\nAnd with the flexible credit model, we think that customers are going to be able to purchase more closely to what they're going to buy because\nthey don't need to make those predictions with margins of error on every individual channel.\n16\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

We will be progressively adding more and more ways for them to use those credits over the course of the contract length. And so\nwe think it's just going to be much healthier position as we continue to move into the future.\nScott Berg - Needham & Company - Analyst\nVery helpful. Thank you for taking the question.\nOperator\nBrent Bracelin, Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin - Piper Sandler - Analyst\nThank you. Good afternoon. Isabelle, I don't want to overlook the first quarter profitability here 6 months ahead of our model, fantastic to see. My\nquestion really is around new customer activity. It sounds robust even in a tough macro.\nHow is the vendor consolidation appetite impacted the size of land? I know historically, you'd land may be smaller with a large brand and then\ngain share over time. Is that starting to change now? Are you seeing maybe larger land opportunities show up in pipeline just given the legacy\nreplacement narrative you're talking about? Thanks.\nIsabelle Winkles - Braze Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean it continues to be a bit of a mix, and our lands are -- we're definitely incentivizing our sales force just to land. And so there's no incentive\nto kind of make the land as big as possible. We certainly don't want to try to force product down to our buyers. We want to make sure that we're\nallowing the buyers to kind of grow naturally and have them put together product sets that make sense for them over the long term. But I wouldn't\nnecessarily say that there's been any directional trend that is sustained or meaningful to kind of change that.\nBrent Bracelin - Piper Sandler - Analyst\nSounds good. Great to see profitability. Thanks.\nOperator\nDerrick Wood, TD Cowen.\nDerrick Wood - TD Cowen - Analyst\nGreat. Thanks. I guess, either one of you guys, just -- could you touch on the relative strength across verticals, which ones are healthier, which ones\nmaybe seeing more pressure or just any notable change in demand across any particular vertical? And then it seems like international growth has\nbeen a bit stronger than US. Could you kind of compare and contrast domestic versus international and why international may be on a bit of a\nstronger trend?\n17\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

So a few things there. First a more expansionary investments into new geos globally, and so we would expect to see that picking up. And\nyou've seen it kind of ticking up a percentage point at a time here or there, and a lot of that just reflects us moving into markets that we weren't\nin before and being able to kind of rapidly grow those at faster rates than the more core business.\nYou also do see that in reflection in some other places, like for instance, you may have seen in Salesforce's results, they actually saw faster growth\nacross EMEA than they have in the United States faster growth in Japan.\nWe're seeing some similar geographic trends there. There are not big differences from place to place. I think broadly, the macro is under pressure\neverywhere. But we are seeing some pockets of strength, and we're investing accordingly in terms of both our event strategy as well as our\ngo-to-market resource deployment there.\nWithin the Braze's customer base, things like consumables and CPG have been on the rise for us. I mentioned that a little bit before. We've also\nseen good increased penetration into financial services and travel and hospitality, as we continue to move through the adoption cycle there. We've\nobviously had great progress from a financial services perspective for many years with a lot of the startups in the FinTech world, but starting to\nbreak into more traditional banks and insurance companies and credit unions and other parts of that mental services universe has been great for\nus.\nI think that's less a reflection of the relative strengths of those verticals and really more of how we've been prioritizing our own go-to-market, and\nyou should continue to expect to see a very diversified expansion in Braze's customer base.\nGoing back to that acquisition efficiency point that I spoke about earlier, we are being very choiceful about where we are investing our efforts in\nplaces where we're developing new frontiers. It's obviously more expensive to get those first reference customers in a given new vertical or a given\nnew geo, than it is to leverage those reference customers to go deeper, penetrate more deeply into a vertical where we already have the proof\npoints and the case studies.\nAnd so what we've been doing is just making sure that we've got a good healthy balance of that so that we're taking advantage of those preexisting\nareas of strength in order to grow efficiently. We'll also reinvesting into those frontiers, whether those are geo or vertical or use case oriented.\nDerrick Wood - TD Cowen - Analyst\nUnderstood. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Nick Altmann with Scotiabank.\nNick Altmann - Scotiabank - Analyst\nAwesome. Thanks, guys. Just to build last question on international. Is there any meaningful difference in the land versus the expand side international\nversus domestic? And then when you look at sort of the international customers, how does sort of their buying propensity compared to the US\nmarket in terms of the willingness to replace legacy systems? Thanks.\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, a few things there. First, I think that the land and expand is more correlated with the customer size. You're much more likely to land at a use\ncase in the enterprise just because of the complexity of those organizations and a lot of the kind of the incumbent advantages and just simple\n18\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

When you look at markets like the US and Europe, obviously, those are places that have very mature\ne-mail markets and a big part of that is because consumers adopt and use e-mail, and it's just a very effective channel.\nFrom an enterprise perspective as well, we definitely see things where I think the west -- it tends to kind of start in the West Coast of the United\nStates and move east when you look at things like willingness to adopt new technology, and that includes kind of hopping over the Atlantic. And\nsome of the buyer trends that we saw in Silicon Valley tech companies several years ago, we're now starting to see in more conservative industries\nand more kind of conservative parts of the world.\nAnd we do a great job, I think, of transferring the learnings across verticals and across time horizons depending on where different parts of the\neconomy are in terms of their transformation or to a there was a hint out customer engagement. It also sometimes literally includes like humans\nand their skill sets and their ways of working and their ways of structuring team, moving from startups to enterprises from some geos to another\nfrom one vertical that tends to be more innovative to moving into places that are more in a from competition and move more slowly.\nAnd so get a lot of benefit out of seeing simultaneously a lot of different parts of the economy across those splits and they behave in different\nways. But we try to make that a strength because we've seen those movies play out before. And if we can effectively bring those learnings into\nnew areas we're able to leverage our global footprint as a massive competitive strength in order to be more efficient in those places.\nNick Altmann - Scotiabank - Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nBrian Peterson, Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson - Raymond James - Analyst\nSorry, guys. I got caught by that view button again. So Bill, great to see the expansion of the eight figure customers. I'm curious if there's any\ncommonality in what drove that in terms of volume, channels, new geos, any perspective there would be helpful. Thanks, guys.\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Across the three of them actually, different stories in each place. One of them, primarily driven by geo-expansion, and another one driven\nby expansion into new parts of the business and the third really driven by more channel expansion and the growth of existing kind of existing new\nprojects. And so I think even within that, without going into a tremendous amount of detail you see a great example of the diversification of races\nopportunities.\nAnd within all three of them, there's actually still a lot of room to run. So I think we're excited about them, both as a testament to the\ncomprehensiveness of Braze's offering and the value that we deliver as well as the opportunity that still lies ahead of us.\n19\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Thanks, Bill\nOperator\nMatt VanVliet, BTIG.\nMatt VanVliet - BTIG - Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, around the free trials, any impact that you're expecting to have on overall deal sizes for new customers?\nAnd then maybe more importantly, on the expansionary capabilities within existing customers. Do you think this speeds things up or just maybe\ngets into other areas and use cases that maybe were a little hesitant to spend budget when they can get their hands on the product immediately\nand then make a decision?\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So I think we're not expecting it to have any sort of material change in average sale prices because as I mentioned before, things like our\nsandbox environment have actually been more utilized in enterprise deal cycles than they were in commercial deal cycles. And over the longer\nterm, maybe that puts some downward pressure on it as we see more volume kind of come into the commercial side. But we're not anticipating\nor expecting any sort of big change there.\nAnd then I think within other organizations, yes, we've seen some great proof points of this so far as we've moved product-led growth motions\ninto some other parts of the product. So as we've allowed things like -- we have a freemium model on our product catalogs offering. We have a\ntrial option for content cards that allows for customers to -- existing customers to test that out.\nAnd so we've already seen some great examples where being able to trial new parts of the product allows for a customer to be -- allows for us to\nbe able to expand into an existing customer more efficiently and more quickly. And so we're certainly expecting a lot of those same things to be\nat play with the overall free trial.\nAnd then also, I think there's a lot of ancillary benefits to the work that gets done around this. The usability, the kind of self-serve onboarding,\nthere's a bunch of requirements to be able to build a great free trial environment. That are also going to just make our integration and onboarding\nmore efficient. We think it's going to improve customer satisfaction. It's going to speed up those integrations, so that customers get up and running\nmore quickly, more easily. We think that will also benefit our partner ecosystem as well.\nRemember that a lot of our integrations and onboardings are delivered by the partner ecosystem. And when those agencies are going to be able\nto focus more on new campaign ideas and building out new content rather than the kind of early ramp of the onboarding and of the product that\na customer will be able to do in a more self-serve manner. That just helps all boats rise from that perspective.\nMatt VanVliet - BTIG - Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nMichael Berg, Wells Fargo.\n20\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

A quick one for either one of you guys here. How do you expand more data capabilities and with your platform\nbeing entrenched in data? We refer to notes of you winning some deals within enterprises data budgets or data initiatives. Is that something you're\nseeing a trend? Or are those more one-offs? Or how can we think about potentially winning deals via data budgets?\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So when I talk about the total cost of ownership of the kind of data footprint that is an important part of it. And while these things are maybe\nbifurcated in certain organizations. When you look at that end goal of -- I need to talk to my customers, I want to deliver great customer engagement\nto them. That includes purchasing in order to get data into Braze, as well as being able to actually deliver those messages. And so I think that those\nbudgets are usually pretty co-located. But you're also seeing in that anecdote and in that evidence, you're also seeing the importance of the technical\nstakeholders and a lot of these buying decisions.\nNot only are they involved in them as stakeholders, sometimes the budgets are coming out of product groups are coming out of engineering\ngroup. And that's why we've been talking about the free trials a lot, but there's a lot that we've done in order make sure that we are kind of speaking\nto and delivering to those technical buyers, whether they're data engineering or product over the last several years, we think it's a really big\nadvantage that Braze will have in the long term. And it's one that's frankly very hard to catch up on.\nAs everyone is aware, we've got very noise on competitive landscape. And I think that Braze stands alone in terms of the stability and the performance\nat scale that we can deliver, the comprehensiveness of the APIs, the different abstraction layers that we expose up and down our stack to technical\ngroups to be able to build with Braze instead of kind of starting on a versus decision that a lot of companies grapple with.\nWe really have leaned into that build with Braze's message over the years, and it's been highly effective in the organizations where technical\nstakeholders are engaged. And so I would take that as a really positive sign. When you're seeing that, that engineering stakeholders are opening\ntheir wallets in order to buy Braze that happened with bidding technology, software very often. And the fact that you're seeing that with Braze is\njust a strong testament to what we can deliver those organizations.\nMichael Berg - Wells Fargo - Analyst\nHelpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nYun Kim, Loop Capital.\nYun Kim - Loop Capital Markets - Analyst\nOkay. Any noticeable change in the channel mix that you're seeing out there or you're expecting in the second half as the international channels\nor international business continues to grow faster? And also, is the macro driving the channel mix back towards more lower-priced channels like\ne-mail? Thanks.\nIsabelle Winkles - Braze Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean, obviously, WhatsApp is a channel that we introduced in the last couple of quarters. So we're seeing healthy uptake there of that\nchannel. I think overall, across the channel mix, we're not seeing sort of meaningful shift among them. You'll continue to see more volumes across\n21\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

I don't anticipate that, that would\nchange over time. But as we introduce new channels, of course, you will see those start to mix into the totals.\nWilliam Magnuson - Braze Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. And I do think to your question about marginal cost of different channels. We have seen across the board a lot of customers just rationalizing\nwhat channels they're using and what places. I think it's a little bit less of a concern around marketing use cases because the marginal cost of e-mail\nor SMS compared to performance advertising, as an example. They're both a lot lower than performance marketing.\nAnd I think where you're seeing optimizations like that happen more often on more utility volumes like a two-factor of code, definitely, a brand\nwould rather send that to you over e-mail or in their app rather than delivering it over SMS, which costs them a lot more. But remember that we\ndon't have a lot of those utility volumes in our customer base already because we really tried to stay upmarket and the more premium use cases\nwhere we're really delivering value to the enhancement of the customer relationship.\nYun Kim - Loop Capital Markets - Analyst\nOkay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nJeffichy (Operator Instructions).\nTaylor McGinnis - UBS - Analyst\nPerfect, thank you. This is Taylor McGinnis. Isabelle the NRR number you report is on a trailing 12-month basis, it's tough to get insight into what\nmight have happened in the quarter. So can you provide more color in terms of the in-period NRR that you might have seen? And if there were\nany changes in gross churn? And then as that relates to the renewal base in the quarter, were there any larger optimizations or slower net upsells\nto flag that might have weighed on that? Thanks.\nIsabelle Winkles - Braze Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So as I mentioned in some of the questions that I answered earlier, some of what you're seeing is the roll off. You correctly identified the\ntrailing 12-month basis. So some of it is the roll-off of sort of that prior quarter we lost in the four-quarter trailing.\nI would say that from a gross churn perspective, there was not anything unexpected in Q2. Churn does continue to remain at a level that is more\nelevated than we would like from a sustained basis. So I would say the continued compounding of that is mixing into the subsequent quarters and\nthen we're obviously losing some of the historically stronger quarters.\nSo I think that's what you're seeing in Q2. Nothing abnormal versus what we were expecting or had embedded in our own guide that happened\nin Q2.\nTaylor McGinnis - UBS - Analyst\nGreat.

Words such as \"anticipate,\" “believe,” \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"goal,\" \"hope,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" “might,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"shall,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" “will,” and\nvariations of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements are based on Braze’s current assumptions,\nexpectations, and beliefs and are subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and changes in circumstances that may cause Braze’s actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or\nachievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties related to: (1) unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on Braze’s business,\nfinancial condition and share price; (2) Braze’s recent rapid revenue growth may not be indicative of its future revenue growth; (3) Braze’s history of operating losses; (4) Braze’s limited operating history at its current scale; (5) Braze’s ability to successfully\nmanage its growth; (6) the accuracy of estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth and the impact that global and domestic socioeconomic events on Braze’s business; (7) Braze’s ability and the ability of its platform to adapt and respond to\nchanging customer or consumer needs, requirements, or preferences; (8) Braze’s ability to attract new customers and renew existing customers; (9) the competitive markets in which Braze participates and the intense competition that it faces; (10) Braze’s ability\nto adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving cybersecurity and data privacy risks, evolving industry standards, or changing regulations; and (11) Braze’s reliance on third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure. Further\ninformation on potential factors that could affect Braze’s business and financial results is included in Braze’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on September 6, 2024. Further, this presentation\nreferences some services or features that have not yet been broadly released, and represent Braze’s current expectations regarding their development and potential performance. Changes in circumstances may cause these current expectations to be\ninaccurate, and there is a risk that such new features may not be delivered on time or at all or, if delivered, they may not perform in the manner Braze currently anticipates. Braze reserves the right to modify, postpone, or cancel these future planned projects at\nany time and for any reason without further notice. The forward-looking statements included in this presentation represent Braze’s views only as of the date of this presentation and Braze assumes no obligation, and does not intend to update these\nforward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP\noperating loss and margin, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, non-GAAP free cash flow, and non-GAAP free cash flow margin. Braze defines non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense,\nnon-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating loss and margin and non-GAAP net loss as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, employer taxes\nrelated to stock-based compensation, charitable contribution expense, acquisition related expense, contingent consideration adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, and restructuring expense. Prior to the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January\n31, 2023, Braze did not adjust non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating loss and margin or non-GAAP net\nloss for acquisition related expense, because there was not acquisition activity by Braze in prior periods. Additionally, prior to the second quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, Braze did not adjust non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP\nsales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating loss and margin, or non-GAAP net loss for amortization of intangible assets, because there were no such\namortizations in prior periods, or for restructuring expense, because such amounts were not material in prior periods. Further, prior to the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, Braze did not adjust non-GAAP gross profit and margin,\nnon-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating loss and margin or non-GAAP net loss for contingent consideration adjustments, because there\nwere no such adjustments in prior periods. Braze defines non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash provided by/used in operating activities, minus purchases of property and equipment and minus capitalized internal use software costs. Braze defines non-GAAP\nfree cash flow margin as the percentage value of the company’s non-GAAP free cash flow in a specified period divided by the company’s revenue in such period. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Braze uses this non-GAAP financial information internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial\nmeasures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP\nresults. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates (GAAP), and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in\nBraze’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by Braze’s management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A\nreconciliation is provided at the end of this presentation for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Braze encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and\nthe reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly and fiscal year financial results, and not to rely on any single financial measure to\nevaluate Braze’s business. Braze has not reconciled its guidance as to non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP net loss or non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measure as a result of uncertainty\nregarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in Braze’s stock price. Accordingly, reconciliation is not\navailable without unreasonable effort, although it is important to note that these factors could be material to Braze’s results calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nCustomer Metrics and Market Data\nUnless otherwise noted, information in this presentation concerning Braze’s industry, including industry statistics and forecasts, competitive position, and the markets in which Braze operates is based on information from independent industry and research\norganizations, other third-party sources and management estimates. Management estimates are derived from publicly available information released by independent industry analysts and other third-party sources, as well as data from Braze's internal research,\nand are based on assumptions made by Braze upon reviewing such data, and Braze’s experience in, and knowledge of, such industry and markets, which it believes to be reasonable. Projections, forecasts, assumptions and estimates of the future performance\nof the industry in which Braze operates and Braze’s future performance are necessarily subject to uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors. Braze has not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by independent\nindustry and research organizations, other third parties, or other publicly available information. Accordingly, Braze makes no representations as to the accuracy or completeness of that information nor does Braze undertake to update such information after the\ndate of this presentation.\nTrademarks\nAll third-party trademarks, including names, logos and brands, referenced by Braze in this presentation are property of their respective owners.

A single organization\ncould have multiple distinct contracting divisions or subsidiaries, all of which together would be considered a single customer.\nMonthly Active User: A monthly active user is an end user of a customer who has engaged with the customer’s applications and websites in the previous 30-day period. We include\neach distinguishable end user in our calculation of monthly active users, even though some users may access our customers’ applications and websites using more than one device, and\nmultiple users may gain access using the same device.\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate: We calculate our dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from a cohort of customers as of 12 months prior to such\nperiod-end (the Prior Period ARR). We then calculate the ARR from the same cohort of customers as of the end of the current period (the Current Period ARR). Current Period ARR\nincludes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months, but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total Current Period\nARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the point-in-time dollar-based net retention rate. We then calculate the weighted average point-in-time dollar-based net retention rates as of\nthe last day of each month in the current trailing 12-month period to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (ARR): We define ARR as the annualized value of customer subscription contracts, including certain premium professional services that are subject to\ncontractual subscription terms, as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms (including contracts for which\nwe are negotiating a renewal). Our calculation of ARR is not adjusted for the impact of any known or projected future events (such as customer cancellations, expansion or contraction of\nexisting customers relationships or price increases or decreases) that may cause any such contract not to be renewed on its existing terms.\nRemaining Performance Obligations: The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents amounts under non-cancelable contracts expected to be\nrecognized as revenue in future periods, and may be influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of service delivery and contract terms.\nUnbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation are subject to future economic risks including bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors.\n118\nGuidance\nDOLLARS AND SHARES IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS\nMetric Q3’25 Guidance FY’25 Guidance\nRevenue $147.5 - 148.5 $582.5 - 585.5\nNon-GAAP Operating Loss ($3.5) - (4.5) ($7.5) - (8.5)\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) ($0.5) - (1.5) $6.5 - 7.5\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per\n$0.00 - (0.01) $0.06 - 0.07\nShare\nWeighted Average Shares\n* **\n~102.0M ~108.0M\nOutstanding\n*Weighted average common shares used in computing non-GAAP earnings per share, basic and diluted.\n**Weighted average common shares used in computing non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted\n119\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Gross Margin Reconciliation\nDOLLARS IN THOUSANDS\nFY’21 FY’22 FY’23 FY’24 1H FY’25\nGross Profit $95,680 $159,524 $239,608 $324,273 $192,990\nPlus:\nStock-based\n650 2,185 3,616 3,585 2,042\ncompensation\nexpense\nEmployer taxes related\nto stock-based compensation - - 71 125 114\nexpense\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit $96,330 $161,709 $243,295 $327,983 $195,146\nGAAP Gross Margin 63.7% 67.0% 67.4% 68.7% 68.7%\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin 64.1% 67.9% 68.5% 69.5% 69.5%\n120\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Loss\nOctober 31, October 31,\n2021 2020 2021 2020\n(34,48 (21,208\nNet loss attributable to Braze, Inc.
