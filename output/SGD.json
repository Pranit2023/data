AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n1. Description of Business\nSafe & Green Holdings Corp. (collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we”, “us” or “our”) was previously known as SG Blocks, Inc. as well as\nCDSI Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 29, 1993. On November 4, 2011, CDSI Merger Sub, Inc., the Company’s wholly-\nowned subsidiary, was merged with and into SG Building Blocks, Inc. (“SG Building,” formerly SG Blocks Inc.) (the “Merger”), with SG Building surviving\nthe Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger was a reverse merger that was accounted for as a recapitalization of SG\nBuilding, as SG Building was the accounting acquirer.\nThe Company operates in the following four segments: (i) construction; (ii) medical; (ii) real estate development; and (iv) environmental. The construction\nsegment designs and constructs modular structures built in the Company’s factories. In the medical segment, the Company uses its modular technology to (i)\nprovide turnkey solutions to medical testing and treatment and generate revenue from the medical testing and point of care treatment in our medical suites and\n(ii) sell and lease medical suites and privacy pods. The Company’s real estate development segment consists of SG DevCorp (as defined below), our majority\nowned subsidiary, which builds innovative and green single or multifamily projects in underserved regions nationally using modules (“Modules”) built in one\nof the Company’s vertically integrated factories. The environmental segment consists of a sustainable medical and waste management solution that collects\nwaste and treats waste for safe disposal.\nThe building products developed with the Company’s proprietary technology and design and engineering expertise are generally stronger, more durable,\nenvironmentally sensitive, and erected in less time than traditional construction methods. The use of the Company's Modules typically provides\nbetween four to six points towards the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) certification levels, including reduced site disturbance,\nresource reuse, recycled content, innovation in design and use of local and regional materials. Due to the ability of the Modules to satisfy such requirements, the\nCompany believes the products produced utilizing its technology and expertise is a leader in environmentally sustainable construction.\nThere are three core product offerings that utilize the Company’s technology and engineering expertise. The first product offering involves GreenSteel™\nmodules, which are the structural core and shell of an SGBlocks building. The Company procures the containers, engineers required openings with structural\nsteel enforcements, paints the SGBlocks and then delivers them on-site, where the customer or a customer’s general contractor will complete the entire finish\nout and installation. The second product offering involves replicating the process to create the GreenSteel product and, in addition, installing selected materials,\nfinishes and systems (including, but not limited to floors, windows, doors, interior painting, electrical wiring and fixtures, plumbing outlets and bathrooms,\nroofing system) and delivering SGBlocks pre-fabricated containers to the site for a third party licensed general contractor to complete the final finish out and\ninstallation. Finally, the third product offering is the completely fabricated and finished SGBlocks building (including but not limited to floors, windows, doors,\ninterior painting, electrical wiring and fixtures, plumbing outlets and bathrooms, roofing systems), including erecting the final unit on site and completing any\nother final steps. The building is ready for occupancy and/or use as soon as installation is completed. Construction administration and/or project management\nservices are typically included in the Company's product offerings.\nThe Company also provides engineering and project management services related to the use and modification of Modules in construction.\nConstruction\nDuring 2020, the Company formed SG Echo, LLC (“SG Echo”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company acquired substantially all the assets\nof Echo DCL (“Echo”), a Texas limited liability company, except for Echo’s real estate holdings for which the Company obtained a right of first refusal. Echo\nis a container/modular manufacturer based in Durant, Oklahoma specializing in the design and construction of permanent modular and temporary modular\nbuildings and was one of the Company’s key supply chain partners. Echo caters to the military, education, administration facilities, healthcare, government,\ncommercial and residential customers. This acquisition has allowed the Company to expand its reach for the Modules and offer an opportunity to vertically\nintegrate a large portion of the Company’s cost of goods sold, as well as increase margins, productivity and efficiency in the areas of design, estimating,\nmanufacturing and delivery and to become the manufacturer of the Company's core container and modular product offerings.\n7\nSAFE & GREEN HOLDINGS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n1. Description of Business (continued)\nMedical\nAs of January 2021 and through the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Chicago Airport Testing\nLLC (“CAT”). The Company had a variable interest in CAT as described further below. CAT is in the business of marketing, selling, distributing, leasing and\notherwise commercially exploiting certain products and services in the COVID-19 testing and other medical industry. In addition, during March 2023, the\nCompany formed Safe and Green Medical Corporation. The Company also entered into a joint venture with Clarity Lab Solutions LLC., to provide clinical lab\ntesting related to COVID-19, which ceased activities in 2022.\nReal Estate Development\nDuring 2021, the Company formed Safe and Green Development Corporation, formerly, SGB Development Corp. (“SG DevCorp”), as a wholly-owned by the\nCompany. SG DevCorp was formed with the purpose of real property development utilizing the Company's technologies. As described in Note 2, the activities\nof SG DevCorp were deconsolidated and determined to be a discontinued operation. As such, the activities of SG DevCorp are no longer a part of the\nCompany’s continuing activities.\nEnvironmental\nDuring 2022, SG Environmental Solutions Corp. (“SG Environmental”) was formed and is focused on biomedical waste removal and plans to utilize a patented\ntechnology that it licenses to shred and disinfect biomedical waste, rendering the waste disinfected, unrecognizable, and of no greater risk to the public health\nthan residential household waste.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn May 2, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its then-outstanding common stock (the “May Stock Split”). All share and per share\namounts set forth in the consolidated financial statements of the Company have been retroactively restated to reflect the 1-for-20 reverse stock split as if it had\noccurred as of the earliest period presented and unless otherwise stated, all other share and per share amounts for all periods presented in this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split effected in May 2024 .\n2. Separation and Distribution\nIn December 2022, the Company and then owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding securities of SG DevCorp announced its plan to separate the Company and\nSG DevCorp into two separate publicly traded companies (the “Separation”). To implement the Separation, on September 27, 2023 (the “Distribution Date”), the\nCompany, effected a pro rata distribution to its stockholders of approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of SG DevCorp’s common stock (the “Distribution”). In\nconnection with the Distribution, each Company stockholder received 0.930886 shares of SG DevCorp’s common stock for every five (5) shares of Company\ncommon stock held as of the close of business on September 8, 2023, the record date for the Distribution, as well as a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares.\nImmediately after the Distribution, SG DevCorp was no longer a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company held approximately 70% of SG\nDevCorp’s issued and outstanding securities. On September 28, 2023, SG DevCorp’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol\n“SGD.”\nIn connection with the Separation and Distribution, SG DevCorp entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with the\nCompany. These agreements provide for the allocation between SG DevCorp and the Company of the assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including,\namong others, investments, property, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) of the Company and its subsidiaries attributable to periods prior to, at\nand after the Separation and will govern the relationship between the Company and SG DevCorp subsequent to the completion of the Separation. In addition to the\nseparation and distribution agreement, the other principal agreements entered into with the Company included a tax matters agreement and a shared services\nagreement.\nDuring 2024, the Company’s ownership in SG DevCorp fell below 50%, and the Company deconsolidated SG DevCorp from its financial statements (the\n“Deconsolidation”). The decrease in ownership percentage resulted from additional equity transactions of SG DevCorp. As of September 30, 2024, the Company\naccounts for its investment in SG DevCorp on the equity method. Upon deconsolidation, the Company recognized a gain of $4,728,348 which resulted from the\ndifference between the fair value of the Company’s investment upon deconsolidation, and the net assets and carrying value of the non-controlling interest. The gain\nis included in income (loss) from discontinued operations. The fair value of the Company’s investment in SG DevCorp upon deconsolidation amounted to\n$8,126,350. The Deconsolidation represents a strategic shift in the Company’s operations and will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial\nresults. Prior year financial statements for 2023 have been restated to present the operations of SG DevCorp as a discontinued operation. This transaction is further\ndescribed in Note 19 and 20.\n8\nSAFE & GREEN HOLDINGS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n3. Liquidity\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $256,957 and a backlog of $1,919,313. See Note 12 for a discussion of\nconstruction backlog. Based on its conversations with key customers, the Company anticipates its backlog to convert to revenue over the following\nperiod:\n2024\nWithin 1 year $ 1,919,313\nTotal Backlog $ 1,919,313\nThe Company has incurred losses since its inception, has negative working capital of $9,519,438 as of September 30, 2024 and has\nnegative operating cash flows, which has raised substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying\nfinancial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or\nthe amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty concerning the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nThe Company intends to meet its capital needs from revenue generated from operations and by containing costs, entering into strategic\nalliances, as well as exploring other options, including the possibility of raising additional debt or equity capital as necessary. There is,\nhowever, no assurance the Company will be successful in meeting its capital requirements prior to becoming cash flow positive.T he\nCompany does not have any additional sources secured for future funding, and if it is unable to raise the necessary capital at the times it\nrequires such funding, it may need to materially change its business plan, including delaying implementation of aspects of such business\nplan or curtailing or abandoning such business plan altogether.\n4. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of presentation and principals of consolidation – The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") for interim financial information and with the instructions to the\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Article 8 Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for\nannual financial statements. The condensed financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and\nnotes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission on May 7, 2024. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal accruals, considered\nnecessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial statements have been included. Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nReclassifications - Certain amounts in the prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statement presentation.\nThese reclassifications have no effect on previously reported net loss or cash flows.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements - New accounting pronouncements implemented by the Company are discussed below or in the related notes,\nwhere appropriate.\nAccounting estimates – The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires\nmanagement to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period, together with amounts disclosed in the related notes to the financial statements. The Company’s estimates used in\nthese financial statements include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, accounts receivable reserves,\ninventory valuations, goodwill, the valuation allowance related to the Company’s deferred tax assets, the carrying amount of intangible\nassets, right of use assets and the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets. Certain of the Company’s estimates could be\naffected by external conditions, including those unique to the Company and general economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that\nthese external factors could have an effect on the Company’s estimates and could cause actual results to differ from those estimates.\n9\nSAFE & GREEN HOLDINGS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n4. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nOperating cycle – The length of the Company’s contracts varies, but is typically\nbetween six to twelve months. In some instances, the length of the contract may exceed twelve\nmonths. Assets and liabilities relating to contracts are included in current assets and current\nliabilities, respectively, in the accompanying balance sheets as they will be liquidated in the normal\ncourse of contract completion, which at times could exceed one year.\nRevenue recognition – The Company determines, at contract\ninception, whether it will transfer control of a promised good or\nservice over time or at a point in time, regardless of the length of\ncontract or other factors. The recognition of revenue aligns with\nthe timing of when promised goods or services are transferred to\ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the\nCompany expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or\nservices. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the\nfollowing five steps in accordance with its revenue policy:\n(1) Identify the contract with a customer\n(2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n(3) Determine the transaction price\n(4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract\n(5) Recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied\nOn certain contracts, the Company applies recognition of revenue over time,\nwhich is similar to the method the Company applied under previous guidance\n(i.e., percentage of completion). Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation\nprocess, it is possible that estimates of costs to complete a performance\nobligation will be revised in the near-term. For those performance obligations\nfor which revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost input method, changes in\ntotal estimated costs, and related progress toward complete satisfaction of the\nperformance obligation, are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the\nperiod in which the revisions to the estimates are made. When the current\nestimate of total costs for a performance obligation indicates a loss, a provision\nfor the entire estimated loss on the unsatisfied performance obligation is made\nin the period in which the loss becomes evident.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe Company’s revenues are primarily derived from construction related to\nModules projects. The Company’s contracts are with customers in various\nindustries. Revenue recognized over time was $3,932,592 and $14,566,351,\nrespectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nRevenue recognized over time was $1,753,223 and $3,965,361, respectively,\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe following tables provide further disaggregation of\nthe Company’s revenues by categories:\n10\nSAFE & GREEN HOLDINGS CORP.

Accounts receivable are recognized net of an\nallowance for credit losses. A considerable amount of judgment is required in\nassessing the likelihood of realization of receivables.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to\ncustomers.\nContract assets include unbilled amounts from long-term construction services\nwhen revenue recognized under the cost-to-cost measure of progress exceeds\nthe amounts invoiced to customers, as the amounts cannot be billed under the\nterms of the Company’s contracts. Such amounts are recoverable from\ncustomers based upon various measures of performance, including\nachievement of certain milestones, completion of specified units or completion\nof a contract. Contract assets are generally classified as current within the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets.\nContract liabilities from construction and engineering contracts occur when\namounts invoiced to customers exceed revenues recognized under the cost-to-\ncost measure of progress. Contract liabilities additionally include advanced\npayments from customers on certain contracts. Contract liabilities decrease as\nthe Company recognizes revenue from the satisfaction of the related\nperformance obligation. Contract liabilities are generally classified as current\nwithin the condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nAlthough the Company believes it has established adequate procedures for\nestimating costs to complete on open contracts, it is at least reasonably possible\nthat additional significant costs could occur on contracts prior to completion.\nThe Company periodically evaluates and revises its estimates and makes\nadjustments when they are considered necessary.\n11\nSAFE & GREEN HOLDINGS CORP.

When evaluating a VIE for consolidation, the Company must determine whether or not there\nis a variable interest in the entity. Variable interests are investments or other interests that absorb\nportions of an entity’s expected losses or receive portions of the entity’s expected returns. If it is\ndetermined that the Company does not have a variable interest in the VIE, no further analysis is\nrequired and the VIE is not consolidated. If the Company holds a variable interest in a VIE, the\nCompany consolidates the VIE when there is a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The Company is determined to have a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive\nbenefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE. This determination is evaluated\nperiodically as facts and circumstances change.\nOn August 27, 2020, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Clarity Lab Solutions,\nLLC (“Clarity Labs”) (the “JV”). In consideration and subject to Clarity Lab’s services and\ncommitments and provided the agreement remains valid and in force, and is not terminated, the\nCompany agreed to issue 200,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock over a defined\nvesting period starting in December 1, 2020. The restricted shares of the Company's common stock\nwere not issued to Clarity Labs as certain capital commitments were not met. Clarity Labs is a licensed\nclinical laboratory that uses specialized molecular testing equipment and that focuses on the diagnosis\nand treatment of critical diseases, including COVID-19. Clarity Labs was also engaged in the business\nof manufacturing, importing and distributing various medical tests. Under the JV, the Company and\nClarity Labs were to jointly market, sell, and distribute certain products and services (“Clarity Mobile\nVenture”). The Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary of Clarity Mobile Venture and\nhas thus consolidated the activities in its consolidated financial statements. Due to the ongoing lower\naffects of COVID-19 restrictions, the JV was wound down during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nOn January 18, 2021, the Company entered into an operating agreement to form CAT. The purpose of\nCAT is to market, sell, distribute, lease and otherwise commercially exploit certain products and\nservices in the COVID-19 testing and other medical industry. The Company has determined it is the\nprimary beneficiary of CAT and has thus consolidated the activities in its consolidated financial\nstatements.\nEquity Method Investments—The Company accounts for investments under the equity method of\naccounting if it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies\nof an entity, but does not have a controlling financial interest. The equity method investment is\ntypically initially recorded at cost and adjusted each period for capital contributions, distributions and\nthe Company's share of the entity’s net income or loss as well as other comprehensive income or loss.\nUpon the Deconsolidation during 2024, the Company began to report its investment in SG DevCorp on\nthe equity method. The Company has elected to measure its investment in SG DevCorp on the fair\nvalue method. Subsequent to the Deconsolidation, the Company disposed a portion of its investment in\nSG DevCorp and recorded a loss of $320,408.\n12\nSAFE & GREEN HOLDINGS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n4. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had a 31% ownership interest in SG DevCorp.\nThe approximate combined financial position of the Company’s equity affiliate (SG DevCorp) is\nsummarized below as of September 30, 2024:\nSeptember\nCondensed balance sheet information: 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nTotal assets $ 13,000,000\nTotal liabilities $ 12,200,000\nStockholder’s equity/Members’ equity $ 800,000\nCash and cash equivalents – The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include all short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily\nconvertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less upon acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents totaled\n$256,957 and $14,212 as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nShort-term investment – The Company classifies investments consisting of a certificate of deposit with a maturity greater than three months but less than one\nyear as short-term investment. The Company had no short-term investment as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, respectively.\nAccounts receivable and allowance for credit losses – Accounts receivable are receivables generated from sales to customers and progress billings on\nperformance type contracts. Amounts included in accounts receivable are deemed to be collectible within the Company’s operating cycle. The Company\nrecognizes accounts receivable at invoiced amounts.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326, Current Expected Credit Losses, on January 1, 2023, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit\nlosses using a current expected credit loss model. The allowance for credit losses on expected future uncollectible accounts receivable is estimated considering\nforecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions.\nThe allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s best estimate of expected losses inherent in the accounts receivable balances. Management provides an\nallowance for credit losses based on the Company’s historical losses, specific customer circumstances, and general economic conditions. Periodically,\nmanagement reviews accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance based on current circumstances and charges off uncollectible receivables when all attempts\nto collect have been exhausted and the prospects for recovery are remote. Recoveries are recognized when they are received. Actual collection losses may differ\nfrom the Company’s estimates and could be material to its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company accounts for the transfer of accounts receivable to a third party under a factoring type arrangement in accordance with ASC8 60, “Transfers and\nServicing”. ASC 860 requires that several conditions be met in order to present the transfer of accounts receivable as a sale. In the case of factoring type\narrangements, the Company has isolated the transferred (sold) assets and has the legal right to transfer its assets (accounts receivable).\nInventory – Raw construction materials (primarily shipping containers and fabrication materials) are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or\nnet realizable value. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the specific identification\nmethod. Medical equipment and COVID-19 test and testing supplies are valued at the lower of cost, (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was inventory of $742,144 and $156,512, respectively, for construction materials.\nGoodwill – The Company performs its impairment test of goodwill at the reporting unit level each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or circumstances\nchange that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of its reporting unit below its carrying values. The Company performs a goodwill impairment test\nby comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value\nexceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any,\nis recognized as an impairment loss. There were no impairments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\n13\nSAFE & GREEN HOLDINGS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n4. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nIntangible assets – Intangible assets consist of $68,344 of trademarks, and $6,706 of website costs that are being amortized over 5 years. The Company evaluated\nintangible assets for impairment during the year ended December 31, 2023 and determined that there was an $1,880,547 impairment loss for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 relating to intangible assets of proprietary knowledge and technology. The amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 was $10,251 and $140,437, respectively. The accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $59,975 and $2,852,929,\nrespectively.\nProperty, plant and equipment – Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the\nestimated lives of each asset. Estimated useful lives for significant classes of assets are as follows: computer and software 3 to 5 years, furniture and\nother equipment 5 to 7 years, automobiles 2 to 5 years, buildings held for lease 5 to 7 years, building 40 years, and equipment 5 to 29 years. Repairs\nand maintenance are charged to expense when incurred.\nConvertible instruments – The Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free standing derivative financial\ninstruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative\ninstrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the\nembedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles\nwith changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would\nbe considered a derivative instrument.\nCommon stock purchase warrants and other derivative financial instruments – The Company classifies as equity any contracts that (i) require physical\nsettlement or net-share settlement or (ii) provides a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in the Company’s own shares (physical settlement or net-share\nsettlement) providing that such contracts are indexed to the Company’s own stock. The Company classifies as assets or liabilities any contracts that (i) require\nnet-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if any event occurs and if that event is outside the Company’s control) or (ii) gives\nthe counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement shares (physical settlement or net-cash settlement). The Company assesses classification of\ncommon stock purchase warrants and other free standing derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between assets and\nliabilities or equity is required.\nFair value measurements – Financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are carried at\ncost, which the Company believes approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nThe Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability\n(an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nThe Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nThe Company uses three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable.\nLevel 3 Inputs that are unobservable (for example, cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions).\n14\nSAFE & GREEN HOLDINGS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n4. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nTransfer into and transfers out of the hierarchy levels are recognized as if they had taken place at the end of the reporting period. There have been no changes in\nLevel 1, Level 2, and Level 3 and no changes in valuation. The fair value of the Company’s equity-based investment in SG DevCorp was determined based on\nLevel 1 inputs. The Company does not have any financial instruments in the Level 2 or Level 3 category.\nFair value measured as of September 30, 2024\nTotal at\nSeptember 30, Quoted prices in Significant other Significant\n2024 active markets observable inputs unobservable inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets\nEquity-based investment – SG DevCorp $ 1,763,594 $ 1,763,594 $ — $ —\nShare-based payments – The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments\nbased on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, including non-employee directors, the fair value of a stock\noption award is measured on the grant date. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period services are required to be\nprovided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on\na graded-vesting basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of each award. Stock-based\ncompensation expense to employees and all directors are reported within payroll and related expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. Stock-based compensation expense to non-employees is reported within marketing and business\ndevelopment expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome taxes – The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future\ntax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes generally\nrepresents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from the differences\nbetween the financial and tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes liabilities for\nanticipated tax audit issues based on the Company’s estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts\nultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the liabilities are no longer\ndetermined to be necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nConcentrations of credit risk – Financial instruments, that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash\nequivalents. The Company places its cash with high credit quality institutions. At times, such amounts may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\ninsurance limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such account and believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on the account.\nWith respect to receivables, concentrations of credit risk are limited to a few customers in the construction industry. The Company performs ongoing credit\nevaluations of its customers’ financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers other than normal lien rights. At September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, 100% of the Company’s gross accounts receivable were due fromf our and three customers, respectively.\nRevenue relating to one customer represented approximately 84% and 100%, respectively, of the Company’s total revenue for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue relating to two and one customers represented approximately 75% and 97% of the Company’s total revenue for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThere were no vendors representing 10% or more of the Company’s total cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The\nCompany believes it has access to alternative suppliers, with limited disruption to the business, should circumstances change with its existing suppliers.\n15\nSAFE & GREEN HOLDINGS CORP.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common\nand potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of the common shares issuable upon the\nexercise of stock options and warrants. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the calculation if their effect is antidilutive.\nAt September 30, 2024, there were options, restricted stock units and warrants of 1,822, 12,406 and 4,008,411, respectively, outstanding that could potentially\ndilute future net income per share. Because the Company had a net loss as of September 30, 2024, it is prohibited from including potential common shares in\nthe computation of diluted per share amounts. Accordingly, the Company has used the same number of shares outstanding to calculate both the basic and\ndiluted loss per share. At September 30, 2023, there were no restricted stock units and options and warrants of 1,821 and 126,251, respectively, outstanding that\ncould potentially dilute future net income per share.\n12.

Share-based Compensation (continued)\nStock-Based Option Awards\nThe Company has issued no stock-based options during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 or 2023.\nBecause the Company does not have significant historical data on employee exercise behavior, the\nCompany uses the “Simplified Method” to calculate the expected life of the stock-based option awards\ngranted to employees.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to certain claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. The Company assesses liabilities and contingencies in\nconnection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that the Company will incur a loss and the\namount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal accruals may be\nincreased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, the\nCompany does not record an accrual, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, and\navailable insurance coverage, the Company believes that the established accruals are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not\nhave a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition. However, in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings, there can be no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of a matter will not exceed established accruals. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of\nmatters may be material to the results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or the income for that particular period.\n1.) Pizzarotti Litigation - On or about August 10, 2018, Pizzarotti, LLC (“Pizzarotti”) filed a complaint against the Company and Mahesh Shetty, the\nCompany’s former President and CFO, and others, seeking unspecified damages for an alleged breach of contract by the Company and another entity named\nPhipps & Co. (“Phipps”). The lawsuit was filed as Pizzarotti, LLC. v. Phipps & Co., et al., Index No. 653996/2018 and commenced in the Supreme Court of\nthe State of New York for the County of New York. On or about April 1, 2019, Phipps filed cross-claims against the Company and Mr. Shetty asserting\nclaims for indemnification, contribution, fraud, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. The Company has likewise cross claimed\nagainst Phipps for indemnification and contribution, claiming that any damages to the Plaintiff were the result of the acts or omissions of Phipps and its\nprincipals.\nPizzarotti’s suit arose from a contract dated April 3, 2018 that it executed with Phipps whereby Pizzarotti, a construction manager, engaged Phipps to perform\nstone procuring and tile work at a construction project located at 161 Maiden Lane, New York 10038. Pizzarotti’s claims against the Company arise from a\npurported assignment agreement dated August 10, 2018, whereby Pizzarotti claims that the Company agreed to assume certain obligations of Phipps under a\ncertain trade contract between Pizzarotti and Phipps. Phipps’ claims against the Company arise from a purported assignment agreement, dated as of May 30,\n2018, among Pizzarotti, Phipps and the Company (the “Assignment Agreement”), pursuant to which, it is alleged, that the Company agreed to provide a letter\nof credit in connection with the sub-contracted work to be provided by Phipps to Pizzarotti.\n39\nSAFE & GREEN HOLDINGS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n17. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)\nThe Company believes that the Assignment Agreement was void for lack of consideration and moved to dismiss the case on those and other grounds. On June\n17, 2020, the New York Supreme Court entered an order dismissing certain claims against the Company brought by cross claimant Phipps. Specifically, the\ncourt dismissed Phipps’ claims for indemnification, contribution, fraud, negligence and negligent misrepresentation. The court did not dismiss Phipps’ claim\nfor breach of the Assignment Agreement. The issue of the validity of the Assignment Agreement, and the Company’s defenses to the claims brought by the\nplaintiff Pizzarotti and cross claimant Phipps, are being litigated. The Company maintains that the Assignment Agreement, to the extent valid and enforceable,\nwas properly terminated and/or there are no damages, and, consequently, that the claims brought against the Company are without merit. The Company\nintends to continue to vigorously defend the litigation. The parties have engaged in written discovery but no depositions have been conducted as of yet. By\nmotion dated February 24, 2021, Pizzarotti moved to stay the entire action pending the outcome of a separate litigation captioned Pizzarotti, LLC v. FPG\nMaiden Lane, LLC et. al., Index No. 651697/2019, involving some of the same parties (but excluding the Company). Phipps cross moved to consolidate the\ntwo actions. The Company opposed both motions. On April 26, 2021, the court denied both motions and directed the parties to meet and confer concerning\nthe scheduling of depositions. On May 10, 2021, the parties jointly filed with the court a proposed order providing the completion of depositions of all parties\nand nonparties by September 30, 2021. On April 4, 2024, the court entered an order setting forth the following dates for the completion of the parties\ndepositions: (1) deposition of plaintiff shall occur by May 31, 2024, (2) deposition of Phipps shall occur by June 30, 2024, (3) deposition of the Company\nshall occur by July 20, 2024, (4) deposition of Mr. Shetty shall occur by August 9, 2024, (5) deposition of FPG Maiden Lane, & J. Landau shall occur by\nAugust 30, 2024, and (6) depositions of non-parties shall occur by September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company cannot estimate any\npotential loss.\n2.) CPF GP 2019-1, LLC (“CPF GP”) Litigation – In September 2023, a suit was filed in the form of a declaratory judgment to say CPF GP did not owe\ncertain monies to the Company. The Company filed counterclaims for the amounts owed. The case settled in February 2024 in exchange for mutual dismissals\nand monthly payments of the balance due, which is $745,000 in total to the Company from CPF GP.\n3.) Farnam Litigation – In October 2023, Farnam Street Financial, Inc. (“Farnam”) filed suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Minnesota (Case No. 23-CV-3212) alleging breaches by the Company under a certain lease agreement between Farnam and the Company dated as\nof October 13, 221. Farnam sought monies owed under such lease agreement. On August 1, 2024, the Company, SG Echo and SG Environmental Solutions\nCorp. (“SG Environmental”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement”) with Farnam to resolve the\npending litigation. Simultaneously with the execution of the Settlement, (i) the Company, SG Environmental and Farnam entered into an assignment and\nassumption agreement, pursuant to which SG Environmental was substituted for the Company as the lessee under the lease agreement, and (ii) SG\nEnvironmental and Farnam executed a new Lease Schedule No. 001R (“Schedule 1R”), which replaced the prior schedule in its entirety. The terms of the\nSettlement included the following: (i) SG Environmental will be the signatory under the “Lessee” under the lease; (ii) the initial term (the “Initial Term”) of\nSchedule 1R is 18 months; (iii) the “Commencement Date” of Schedule 1R is August 1, 2024; (iv) the original cost of the equipment subject to Schedule 1R\nis $1,556,163.00; (v) so long as there has been no default under the lease and Schedule 1R, SG Environmental shall have the option to purchase the equipment\nat the end of the Initial Term for thirty-five percent (35%) of the original cost of the equipment, or $544,657.05, plus applicable taxes; (vi) the “Monthly Lease\nCharge” under Schedule 1R is $65,880.95, plus applicable taxes; and (vii) SG Environmental shall provide a new security deposit under Schedule 1R in the\namount of $167,056.00, which shall be paid on or before August 1, 2024.

The construction segment designs and\nconstructs modular structures built in our factories using raw materials that are Made-in-America. In the medical segment we use our modular technology to offer turnkey\nsolutions to medical testing and treatment and generating revenue from medical testing. Our real estate development segment builds innovative and green single or\nmultifamily projects in underserved regions nationally using modules built in one of our vertically integrated factories. The environmental segment, the newest segment, is a\nsustainable medical and waste management solution that has a patented technology to collect waste and treat waste for safe disposal.\nWe are a provider of modular facilities (“Modules”). We currently provide Modules made out of both code-engineered cargo shipping containers and wood for use as both\npermanent or temporary structures for residential housing use and commercial use, including for health care facilities. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modules we\nsupplied were primarily for retail, restaurant and military use and were manufactured by third party suppliers using our proprietary technology and design and engineering\nexpertise, which modifies code-engineered cargo shipping containers and purpose-built modules for use for safe and sustainable commercial, industrial and residential\nbuilding. Since our acquisition in September 2020 of Echo DCL, LLC (“Echo”), one of our key supply chain providers, we now have more control over the manufacturing\nprocess and have increased our product offerings to add Modules made out of wood. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we began increasing our focus\non providing our Modules as health care facilities for deployable medical response solutions. In February 2023, we entered into an agreement with The Peoples Health Care,\nin Glendale, California, working in conjunction with Teamsters Local 848, to deliver four Modules to provide medical services to union members. In March 2023, we\nformed Safe & Green Medical Corporation to focus on our medical segment with an objective to establish a national presence with various clinics and labs that cater to the\nspecific needs of local communities. During 2021, through our subsidiary, Safe and Green Development Corporation. (“SG DevCorp”), we also began to focus on acquiring\nproperty to build multi-family housing communities that allows us to utilize the manufacturing services of Echo. SG Environmental Solutions Corp. (“SG Environmental”),\nformed in Delaware is focused on biomedical waste removal and will utilize a patented technology that it licenses to shred and disinfect biomedical waste, rendering the\nwaste disinfected, unrecognizable, and of no greater risk to the public health than residential household waste.\nSG DevCorp develops, co-develops builds and finances single and multi-family homes in underserved regions nationally using modules built ino ne of our vertically\nintegrated factories. SG DevCorp has a minority interest in Norman Berry II Owners LLC and JDI-Cumberland Inlet LLC.\nDuring 2024, the Company’s ownership in SG DevCorp fell below 50%, and the Company deconsolidated SG DevCorp from its financial statements (the\n“Deconsolidation”). As of September 30, 2024, the Company accounts for its investment in SG DevCorp on the equity method. Upon deconsolidation, the Company\nrecognized a gain of $4,728,348 which resulted from the difference between the fair value of the Company’s investment upon deconsolidation, and the net assets and\ncarrying value of the non-controlling interest. The Deconsolidation represents a strategic shift in the Company’s operations and will have a major effect on the Company’s\noperations and financial results. Prior year financial statements for 2023 have been restated to present the operations of SG DevCorp as a discontinued operation\nRecent Developments\nOn October 30, 2024, we have successfully completed two substantial projects for a long-time customer, a large contractor to a U.S. government agency. The contracts,\ntotaling 45 container-style office units, included one order for 15 units and another for 30 units, resulting in significant time and material savings for the customer. The\nentire design-to-completion process highlights SG Echo’s rapid production capabilities, high-quality manufacturing, and commitment to timely delivery. The office units,\ncustom-designed from shipping containers, provide flexible, “plug-and-play” temporary office solutions for U.S. military operations. Each unit is built to meet strict safety\nand quality standards, underscoring SG Echo’s reputation for reliability, durability, and cost-effectiveness in modular construction. The quick turnaround time of the project\nemphasizes SG Echo’s efficiency and capability in supporting government projects on tight timelines.\nOn November 6, 2024, we entered into an agreement with a single investor that is an existing holder of warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Company for\ncash (the “Existing Warrants”), wherein the investor agreed to exercise the Existing Warrants to purchase up 2,758,620 shares of common stock at a reduced exercise price\nof $0.8718 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $2.4 million, before deducting offering fees and other expenses payable by the Company. In\nconsideration for the exercise of the Existing Warrants for cash, the investor received new warrants (the “New Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 5,517,240\nshares of common stock. The New Warrants are exercisable after stockholder approval at an exercise price of $0.8718 per common share and will expire five years after\nstockholder approval. The Company issued and sold the New Warrants and any shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the New Warrants in reliance on the\nexemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) thereof and Rule 506 of\nRegulation D thereunder.\n49\nResults of Operations\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Nine For the Nine\nMonths Ended Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nTotal revenue $ 3,932,592 $ 14,566,351\nTotal cost of revenue 3,618,031 15,138,225\nTotal payroll and related expenses 3,507,118 5,419,852\nTotal other operating expenses 1,829,370 4,052,957\nTotal operating loss (5,021,927) (10,044,683)\nTotal other expense (8,119,147) (22,450)\nTotal loss before income tax (13,141,074) (10,067,133)\nCommon stock deemed dividend (1,146,594) —\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations 2,776,013 (2,615,965)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders of Safe & Green Holdings Corp. $ (11,511,655) $ (12,683,098)\nRevenue\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we derived revenue from our construction segment. Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\n$3,932,592 compared to $14,566,351 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of $10,633,759, or approximately 73%, was mainly driven by a decrease\nin revenues from construction services due to less jobs in progress.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nCost of revenue was $3,618,031 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $15,138,225 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of\n$11,520,194, or a decrease of approximately 76%, is primarily related to the decrease in construction services during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nGross profit (loss) was $314,561 and $(571,874) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nGross profit (loss) margin percentage increased to 8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (4)% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily due to the recognition of losses on construction services recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nPayroll and related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $3,507,118 compared to $5,419,852 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This\ndecrease was primarily caused by a decrease in the vesting of restricted stock units during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior period, as\nwell as the deconsolidation of SG DevCorp during 2024.\nOther operating expenses (general and administrative expenses and marketing and business development expenses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were\n$1,829,370 compared to $4,052,957 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to an overall decrease in operating expenses spend during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as the deconsolidation of SG DevCorp during 2024..\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $9,570 mainly derived from bank interest and interest associated with an outstanding note receivable.\nThere was $22,002 of interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was $186,634 and $690,618 of other income for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $(2,404,277) and $(735,070), respectively. The\nincrease in interest expense resulted from an increase in notes payable balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, there was a change in fair value of equity-based investments of $(5,590,666) recognized which resulted from the deconsolidation of SG DevCorp as\nwell as $320,408 recognized from the disposition of SG DevCorp shares.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a gain on deconsolidation of $4,738,348 recognized which resulted from the deconsolidation of SG DevCorp,\nas well as $1,952,335 in a net loss recognized. .\n50\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Three For the Three\nMonths Ended Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nTotal revenue $ 1,753,223 $ 3,965,361\nTotal cost of revenue 1,878,799 4,501,393\nTotal payroll and related expenses 1,761,827 591,130\nTotal other operating expenses 353,682 1,263,971\nTotal operating loss (2,241,085) (2,391,133)\nTotal other expense (1,475,020) (293,458)\nTotal loss before income tax (3,716,105) (2,684,591)\nAdd: Net income attributable non-controlling interest — —\nLoss from discontinued operations — (923,543)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders of Safe & Green Holdings Corp. $ (3,716,105) $ (3,608,134)\nRevenue\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we derived revenue primarily from our construction segment.

This\nincrease was primarily caused by a decrease in the vesting of restricted stock units during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period.\nOther operating expenses (general and administrative expenses and marketing and business development expenses) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were\n$353,682 compared to $1,263,971 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to an overall decrease in operating expenses spend during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, as well as the deconsolidation of SG DevCorp during 2024.\nOther Income (Expense)\nThere was $3,186 of interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. There was $2,652 and $102,128 of other income for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $864,007 and $398,772, respectively.

Additionally, during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, there was a change in fair value of equity-based investments of $(613,665) recognized which resulted from the deconsolidation of SG DevCorp.\nIncome Tax Provision\nA 100% valuation allowance was provided against the deferred tax asset consisting of available net operating loss carry forwards and, accordingly, no income tax benefit\nwas provided.\n51\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has caused increases on some of the Company's estimated costs for construction projects in progress and completed during the pastt wo fiscal years, which has\naffected the Company's revenue and income (loss) from continuing operations.\nOur operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 may not be indicative of our future operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an aggregate of $256,957 and $14,212, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nHistorically, our operations have primarily been funded through proceeds from equity and debt financings, as well as revenue from operations.\nWe have negative operating cash flows, which has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period ofo ne year after the date the\nfinancial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued.\nWe intend to meet our capital needs from revenue generated from operations and by containing costs, entering into strategic alliances, as well as exploring other options,\nincluding the possibility of raising additional debt or equity capital as necessary. There is, however, no assurance we will be successful in meeting our capital requirements\nprior to becoming cash flow positive. We do not have any additional sources secured for future funding, and if we are unable to raise the necessary capital at the times we\nrequire such funding, we may need to materially change our business plan, including delaying implementation of aspects of such business plan or curtailing or abandoning\nsuch business plan altogether.\nOn July 31, 2024, SG Building Blocks, Inc. (“SG Building”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Cash Advance Agreement (the “Fifth Cedar Cash\nAdvance Agreement”) with Cedar Advance LLC (“Cedar”), pursuant to which SG Building sold to Cedar $1,957,150 of its future receivables for a purchase price of\n$1,350,000, less underwriting fees and expenses paid and the repayment of prior amounts due to Cedar, for net proceeds to SG Building of $285,180. Cedar is expected to\nwithdraw $49,150 a week directly from SG Building until the $1,957,150 due to Cedar is paid in full. In the event of a default (as defined in the Fifth Cedar Cash Advance\nAgreement), Cedar, among other remedies, can demand payment in full of all amounts remaining due under the Fifth Cash Advance Agreement. SG Building’s obligations\nunder the Fifth Cash Advance Agreement have been guaranteed by SG Echo, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\n52\nOn August 27, 2024, SG Building entered into a Cash Advance Agreement (the “Pawn Cash Advance Agreement”) with Pawn Funding (“Pawn”) pursuant to which SG\nBuilding sold to Pawn $599,600 of its future receivables for a purchase price of $400,000, less underwriting fees and expenses paid and the repayment of prior amounts due\nPawn, for net funds provided of $360,000. Pursuant to the Pawn Cash Advance Agreement, Pawn is expected to withdraw $4,999.67 a week directly from SG Building until\nthe $599,600 due to Pawn is paid in full. In the event of a default (as defined in the Pawn Cash Advance Agreement), Cedar, among other remedies, can demand payment in\nfull of all amounts remaining due under the Pawn Cash Advance Agreement.\nOn August 28, 2024, the Company issued a promissory note (the “August 1800 Diagonal Note”) in favor of1 800 Diagonal in the principal amount of $290,000 for a\npurchase price of $250,000, representing an original issue discount of $40,000. A one-time interest charge of twelve percent (12%) be applied on the issuance date to the\nprincipal balance. Under the terms of the August 1800 Diagonal Note, beginning on February 28, 2025, the Company is required to make five monthly payments of accrued,\nunpaid interest and outstanding principal, subject to adjustment, in the amount of $40,600, with $162,400 being due on February 28, 2025.

The connection with the August 1800 Diagonal Note, the Company incurred $8,000 in debt\nissuance costs. The August 1800 Diagonal Note has default terms similar to the 1800 Diagonal Note as described above.\nOn September 20, 2024, SG Echo entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Enhanced Loan Agreement”) with Enhanced Capital Oklahoma Rural Fund, LLC\n(“Enhanced”) pursuant to which SG Echo borrowed $4,000,000 (the “Principal”) from Enhanced, and whereby SG Echo executed and delivered a Secured Promissory Note\n(the “Enhanced Note”) to Enhanced to evidence SG Echo’s obligations under the Enhanced Loan Agreement. The Enhanced Note shall bear interest at a rate equal to the\ngreater of (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus six and sixty-five tenths percent (6.65%) and (ii) ten percent (10.0%) per annum (the “Interest Rate”).\nSG Echo shall pay to Enhanced a closing fee of $80,000, which shall be due and payable on October 1, 2025, unless such date shall be extended by Lender. SG Echo’s\nobligations under the Enhanced Loan Agreement and the Enhanced Note have been guaranteed by the Company.\nPursuant to the terms of the Enhanced Note, SG Echo shall make monthly payments of accrued interest on the first business day of each calendar month until December 31,\n2025. Commencing January 2026, SG Echo shall make monthly payments of accrued interest and additionally shall make a monthly principal payment on the Note in an\namount equal to $22,222.22. The maturity date of the Note shall be the sixty-month anniversary of the closing date (the “Enhanced Maturity Date”). All outstanding\nprincipal and accrued interest shall be due and payable on the Enhanced Maturity Date.\nPursuant to the terms of the Enhanced Loan Agreement, on the closing date, $360,000 (the “Interest Reserve”) will be deposited in a segregated deposit account in SG\nEcho’s name, which account shall be subject to a Control Agreement in favor of the Lender (the “Interest Reserve Account”). Beginning February 1, 2025, Lender may\nwithdraw the monthly interest payments due under the Enhanced Note from the Interest Reserve Account until the Interest Reserve has been fully withdrawn. SG Echo shall\nhave no obligation to replenish amounts withdrawn from the Interest Reserve Account.\nPursuant to the terms of the Enhanced Loan Agreement, SG Echo shall grant Enhanced a first priority mortgage on the real property located at 101 Waldron Rd., Durant,\nOklahoma. Additionally, SG Echo shall grant Lender a continuing security interest in, a general lien upon, collateral assignment of, and a right of set-off against all of SG\nEcho’s right, title, and interest in and to all assets of SG Echo.\nIn the event of default (as defined in the Enhanced Loan Agreement), Enhanced, among other remedies, can demand all amounts and/or liabilities owing from time to time\nby SG Echo to Enhanced pursuant to the Enhanced Loan Agreement and the Enhanced Note (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under the Enhanced\nLoan Agreement due and payable.\n53\nWe continue to generate losses from operations. As of September 30, 2024, our stockholders’ equity was $(8,158,927), compared to $(6,334,859) as of December 31, 2023,\nand we had an accumulated deficit of $84,303,865, compared to $75,930,805 as of December 31, 2023. Our net loss attributable to our common stockholders for then ine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 was $(11,511,655) and net cash used in operating activities was $9,915,916.\nWe will need to generate additional revenues or secure additional financing sources, such as debt or equity capital, to fund future growth, which financing may not be\navailable on favorable terms or at all. We are in the process of securing funding, which we believe will provide the needed working capital until we are cash flow positive,\nwhich we believe will be in [the second half of 2024]. If we are unable to raise the necessary capital at the times we require such funding, we may need to materially change\nour business plan, including delaying implementation of aspects of such business plan or curtailing or abandoning such business plan altogether.\nCash Flow Summary\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (9,915,916)$ (4,671,863)\nInvesting activities (401,448) (692,603)\nFinancing activities 10,560,109 5,494,596\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 242,745 $ 130,130\nOperating activities used net cash of $9,915,916 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and used net cash of $4,671,863 during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Generally, our net operating cash flows fluctuate primarily based on changes in our profitability and working capital. Cash used in operating activities\nincreased by approximately $5,244,053.\nInvesting activities used net cash of $401,448 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $692,603 net cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 a\ndecrease in cash used of $291,155. This amount resulted from $8,007 in purchases of property and equipment, , $125,000 received from the sale of equity-based investment\nand $154,089 in project development costs, as well as $364,352 used in discontinued operations.\nFinancing activities provided net cash of $10,560,109 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Financing activities provided $5,494,596 net cash during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. This amount resulted from $5,143,298 in repayments of short-term notes payable, proceeds of $8,013,745 from the issuances of short-\nterm notes payable, $494,213 received from a warrant inducement transaction, $30 from prefunded warrant exercise, and $3,619,253 from proceed from issuance of\nstock, as well as $3,576,166 received from discontinued operations.\n54\nThere can be no assurance that our customers will decide to and/or be able to proceed with these construction projects, or that we will ultimately recognize revenue from\nthese projects in a timely manner or at all.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements to which we are a party.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions which, in our judgment, are normal and customary for\ncompanies in our industry sector. These agreements are typically with consultants and certain vendors. Pursuant to these agreements, we generally agree to indemnify, hold\nharmless, and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to actions taken or omitted by us. The maximum potential\namount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. We have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or\nsettle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal. Accordingly, we have no\nliabilities recorded for these provisions as of September 30, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In\nconnection with the preparation of the financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other\nfactors that we believe to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions,\nestimates, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot\nbe determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in “Note 3— Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our\nreported financial results.\nShare-based payments. We measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and\ndirectors, including non-employee directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date. For non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-\nmeasured on interim financial reporting dates and vesting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period services are\nrequired to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a graded-vesting basis over the requisite\nservice period for each separately vesting tranche of each award. Stock-based compensation expense to employees and all directors is reported within payroll and related\nexpenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Stock-based compensation expense to non-employees is reported within marketing and business development expense\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\nOther derivative financial instruments. We classify as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) provide a choice of net-cash\nsettlement or settlement in our own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement), provided that such contracts are indexed to our own stock. We classify as assets or\nliabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if any event occurs and if that event is outside SGB’s\ncontrol) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement shares (physical settlement or net-cash settlement). SGB assesses classification of\ncommon stock purchase warrants and other free-standing derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between assets and liabilities or\nequity is required\nConvertible instruments. We bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments according to\ncertain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (i) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely\nrelated to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract; (ii) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract\nis not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable GAAP measures with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur; and (iii) a separate instrument\nwith the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.\nWe determined that the embedded conversion options that were included in the previously outstanding convertible debentures should be bifurcated from their host and a\nportion of the proceeds received upon the issuance of the hybrid contract has been allocated to the fair value of the derivative. The derivative was subsequently marked to\nmarket at each reporting date based on current fair value, with the changes in fair value reported in results of operations.\n55\nCritical Accounting Estimates (continued)\nRevenue recognition – We determine, at contract inception, whether we will transfer control of a promised good or service over time or at a point in time, regardless of the\nlength of contract or other factors. The recognition of revenue aligns with the timing of when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps in\naccordance with its revenue policy:\n(1) Identify the contract with a customer\n(2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n(3) Determine the transaction price\n(4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract\n(5) Recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied\nOn certain contracts, the Company applies recognition of revenue over time, which is similar to the method the Company applied under previous guidance (i.e. percentage\nof completion). Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that estimates of costs to complete a performance obligation will be revised in the near-\nterm. For those performance obligations for which revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost input method, changes in total estimated costs, and related progress toward\ncomplete satisfaction of the performance obligation, are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions to the estimates are made. When the\ncurrent estimate of total costs for a performance obligation indicate a loss, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the unsatisfied performance obligation is made in the\nperiod in which the loss becomes evident.\nGoodwill – The Company performs its impairment test of goodwill at the reporting unit level each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that\nwould more likely than not reduce the fair value of its reporting unit below its carrying values. The Company performs a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit with its carrying value and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the\ntotal amount of goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss. There were no\nimpairments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nIntangible assets – Intangible assets consist of $68,344 of trademarks, and $6,706 of website costs that are being amortized over 5 years. The Company evaluated intangible\nassets for impairment during the year ended December 31, 2023 and determined that there was an $1,880,547 impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 2023\nrelating to intangible assets of proprietary knowledge and technology. The amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $10,251 and\n$140,437, respectively. The accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $59,975 and $2,852,929, respectively.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements.\n56\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to our results under GAAP, we also present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for historical periods. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and have been presented as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We calculate\nEBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense), depreciation and amortization. We calculate\nAdjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before certain non-recurring, unusual or non-operational items, such as litigation expense, stock issuance expense and stock compensation\nexpense. We believe that adjusting EBITDA to exclude the effects of these items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations provides management\nand investors with a meaningful measure that increases period-to -period comparability of our operating performance.\nWe believe the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful by enhancing the readers’ ability to understand the Company’s operating performance.\nOur management utilizes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a means to measure performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts,\ninvestors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. These measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, provide\ninvestors with an additional financial analytical framework that may be useful in assessing us and our results of operations.\nOur measurements of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar titled measures reported by other companies. Other companies, including other\ncompanies in our industry, may not use such measures or may calculate one or more of the measures differently than as presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,\nlimiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, or any other measures of financial performance derived in accordance with GAAP.\nWe do not consider these non-GAAP measures to be substitutes for or superior to the information provided by our GAAP financial results. . The non-GAAP information\nshould be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nThese measures also should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the non-recurring, unusual or non-operational items for which these\nnon-GAAP measures make adjustments. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be liquidity measures.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information (continued)\nThe following is a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure, net gain (loss) attributable to common stockholders:\nThree Months Three Months Nine Months Nine Months\nEnded Ended Ended Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders of Safe & Green Holdings Corp. $ (3,716,105) $ (3,608,134) $ (11,511,655) $ (12,683,098)\nAddback interest expense 864,007 398,772 2,404,277 735,070\nAddback interest income — (3,186) (9,570) (22,002)\nAddback depreciation and amortization 110,407 1,448,305 1,709,230 1,538,585\nEBITDA (non-GAAP) (2,741,691) (1,764,243) (7,407,718) (10,431,445)\nCommon stock deemed dividend — — 1,146,594 —\nGain on deconsolidation-SG DevCorp (including noncontrolling interest\nportion) — — (3,990,304) —\nChange in fair value of equity-based investments 613,665 — 5,590,666 —\nLoss on disposition of equity-based investments — — 320,408 —\nAddback litigation expense 43,801 — 356,046 17,361\nAddback stock issued for services — — — 484,825\nAddback stock compensation expense 570,362 — 1,097,698 3,210,631\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ (1,513,863) $ (1,764,243) $ (2,886,610) $ (6,718,628)\n57\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot required.\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement of Safe & Green Holdings Corp., with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act, Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer concluded that,\nas of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or\nsubmit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated\nand communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\nThe Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nFor the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluations\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) or Rule 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial\nreporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be\nconsidered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that\nmisstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the\nrealities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the\nindividual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on\ncertain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future\nconditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n58\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. Legal Proceedings\nThe information included in \"Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies\" of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report\nForm 10-Q is incorporated by reference into this Item.\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with all other information in this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the following risks actually materializes, our operating\nresults, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or\nall of your investment. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" contained in\nthe 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in “Part I—Item1 A. Risk Factors” in our 2023 Form 10-K, except as follows:\nIf we are not successful in our efforts to increase sales or raise capital, we could experience a shortfall in cash over the nextt welve months, and our ability to obtain\nadditional financing on acceptable terms, if at all, may be limited.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents and a short-term investment, collectively, of $256,957 and $14,212 respectively.\nHowever, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of Safe & Green Holdings\nCorp. of $(11,511,655) and $(12,683,098), respectively, and used $9,915,916 and $4,671,863 of cash for operations, respectively. If we are not successful with our efforts to\nincrease revenue, we could experience a shortfall in cash over the next twelve months. If there is a shortfall, we may be forced to reduce operating expenses, among other\nsteps, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our operations going forward.\nWe may also seek to obtain debt or additional equity financing to meet any cash shortfalls. The type, timing and terms of any financing we may select will depend on,\namong other things, our cash needs, the availability of other financing sources and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. However, there can be no assurance that\nwe will be able to secure additional funds if needed and that, if such funds are available, the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us. In addition, our inability to\ncurrently utilize a short form registration statement on Form S-3 may impair our ability to obtain capital in a timely fashion. If we are unable to secure additional financing,\nfurther reduction in operating expenses might need to be substantial in order for us to ensure enough liquidity to sustain our operations. Any equity financing would be\ndilutive to our stockholders. If we incur debt, we will likely be subject to restrictive covenants that significantly limit our operating flexibility and require us to encumber\nour assets. If we fail to raise sufficient funds and continue to incur losses, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of strategic opportunities, or otherwise respond\nto competitive pressures will be significantly limited. Any of the above limitations could force us to significantly curtail or cease our operations, and you could lose all of\nyour investment in our common stock. These circumstances have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and continued cash losses may\nrisk our status as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going\nconcern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains a note stating that the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will\ncontinue as a going concern. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents and a short-term investment, collectively, of $256,957 and\n$14,212, respectively. However, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of\nSafe & Green Holdings Corp. of $(11,511,655) and $(12,683,098), respectively, and used $9,915,916 and $4,671,863 of cash for operations, respectively.\nWe have incurred losses since inception, have negative working capital of $11,237,131 as of September 30, 2024 and have negative operating cash flows, which has raised\nsubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect our current cash and the proceeds from anticipated financings to be sufficient for working\ncapital until we are cash flow positive, which we believe will be in the first half of2 025.\nThe loss of one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nA few customers have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in anyo ne year or over a period of several consecutive years. For\nexample, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 approximately 84% of our revenue was generated from one customer and for the year ended December 31, 2023,\napproximately 87% of our revenue was generated from one customers. Although we have contractual relationships with many of our significant customers, our customers\nmay unilaterally reduce or discontinue their contracts with us at any time. The loss of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n59\nOur clients may adjust, cancel or suspend the contracts in our backlog; as such, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. In\naddition, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins.\nBacklog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts we have been awarded. Backlog may\nfluctuate significantly due to the timing of orders or awards for large projects and is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which backlog will be\nrecognized as revenue. We include in backlog only those contracts for which we have reasonable assurance that the customer can obtain the permits for construction and can\nfund the construction. As of December 31, 2023, our backlog totaled approximately $1.9 million and as of September 30, 2024, our backlog totaled approximately $1.9\nmillion. Our backlog is described more in detail in “Note 13—Construction Backlog” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot provide assurance that our backlog will be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. In\naccordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination or suspension at our customer’s discretion. In the event of a\nproject cancellation, we generally would not have a contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. Projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of\ntime because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. In addition, the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or\nsuspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices.\nThe contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided and adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. The revenue for certain\ncontracts included in backlog is based on estimates. Additionally, our performance of our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and, therefore, our future\nprofitability. We can provide no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce revenues in the amounts currently estimated, will generate gross margins at\nthe rates we have realized in the past.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options, warrants and restricted stock units may dilute the percentage ownership of the\nthen-existing stockholders and may make it more difficult to raise additional equity capital.\nAt September 30, 2024, there were options, restricted stock units and warrants of 1,822, 12,406 and 4,008,411, respectively, outstanding that could potentially dilute future\nnet income per share. Because the Company had a net loss as of September 30, 2024, it is prohibited from including potential common shares in the computation of diluted\nper share amounts. Accordingly, the Company has used the same number of shares outstanding to calculate both the basic and diluted loss per share. At September 30, 2023,\nthere were no restricted stock units and options and warrants of 1,822 and 126,251, respectively, outstanding that could potentially dilute future net income per share.\nIf SG DevCorp were to default in its obligation to repay the loan received from BCV S&G it could adversely affect our investment in SG DevCorp.\nTo date, SG DevCorp has received $1,750,000 as a secured loan from BCV S&G, a Luxembourg-based specialized investment fund, and has entered into a loan agreement\nwith BCV S&G DevCorp to receive up to $2,000,000 as a secured loan. The loan matures on December 1, 2024 and is secured by 1,999,999 of our shares of SG DevCorp’s\ncommon stock. The loan agreement, as amended, provides that if SG DevCorp’s shares of common stock were not listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market before September 30,\n2023 or if following such listing the total market value of the pledged shares falls below twice the face value of the loan, the loan would be further secured by SG\nDevCorp’s St. Mary’s industrial site. Following the listing, the total market value of the pledged shares has fallen below twice the face value of the loan and SG DevCorp\nand BCV S&G are in discussions regarding alternatives. If SG DevCorp were to default in its obligation to repay the loan when due it could adversely affect our investment\nin SG DevCorp.\nChanges in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, domestic and foreign trade policies, monetary policies and other factors beyond our control may\nadversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe uncertain financial markets, disruptions in supply chains, mobility restraints, and changing priorities as well as volatile asset values also affect our business operations\nand our ability to enter into collaborations and joint ventures. To date, inflation has caused increases on some of our estimated costs for construction projects in progress and\ncompleted during the past two fiscal years, which has affected our revenue and income(loss) from continuing operations. It is difficult to predict the impact on increasing\ninflation on our operations. We are actively monitoring the effects these disruptions and increasing inflation could have on our operations.\n60\nA number of other economic and geopolitical factors both in the U.S. and abroad, could ultimately have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations or cash flows, including the following:\n● effects of significant changes in economic, monetary and fiscal policies in the U.S. and abroad including currency fluctuations, inflationary pressures and\nsignificant income tax changes;\n● supply chain disruptions;\n● a global or regional economic slowdown in any of our market segments;\n● changes in government policies and regulations affecting the Company or its significant customers;\n● postponement of spending, in response to tighter credit, financial market volatility and other factors;\n● rapid material escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and litigation;\n● the effects of the war in the Middle East;\n● longer payment cycles;\n● credit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable; and\n● the impact of each of the foregoing on outsourcing and procurement arrangements.\nFailure to meet NASDAQ’s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock, negatively impact the price of our common stock\nand negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq” or the “Nasdaq Capital Market”), which imposes, among other requirements, a minimum bid\nrequirement. On May 10, 2024, the Company received a letter (the “Delisting Notice”) from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that Nasdaq\npreviously notified the Company on November 7, 2023 that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (“Rule 5550(a)(2)”), which requires a\nminimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share for continued listing.On May 16, 2014, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that for the period from May 2,\n2024 to May 15, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock had been at $1.00 per share or greater, and accordingly the Company had regained\ncompliance with Rule 5550(a)(2). However, the Company cannot provide assurances that it will be able to continue to comply with Rule 5550(a)(2) in the future.\nOn April 19, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying it that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule5 250(c)(1) (“Rule 5250(c)(1)”),\nwhich requires companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC for continued listing. On May 13, 2024, the Company received a letter from\nNasdaq notifying the Company that, based on the May 7, 2024 and May 10, 2024 filings of the Company’s Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A, respectively, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had regained compliance with Rule 5250(c)(1). However, the Company cannot provide assurances that it will be able to continue to\ncomply with Rule 5250(c)(1) in the future.\nOn May 16, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule5 550(b)(1) (“Rule\n5550(b)(1)”) because the stockholders’ equity of the Company of $6,334,859, as reported in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023, was below the minimum requirement of $2.5 million. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company does not have a market value of listed\nsecurities of $35 million, or net income from continued operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed\nfiscal years, the alternative quantitative standards for continued listing on Nasdaq. In accordance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rules, the Company had until June 30, 2024 to\nsubmit a plan to regain compliance with Rule 5550(b)(1). On July 25, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that, based on its review of the Company and the materials\nsubmitted by the Company to Nasdaq, Nasdaq Staff determined to grant the Company an extension to regain compliance with Rule 5550(b)(1) until November 12, 2024,\nsubject to the Company regaining and evidencing compliance with Rule 5550(b)(1) by such date.\nThe Company expects to regain compliance with Rule 5550(b)(1) as a result of the recent private placement, cost-cutting initiatives aimed at achieving positive cash\nflow in 2024, ongoing debt reduction and other strategic initiatives; provided that there can be no assurances that such measures will be consummated or that they will\nachieve their intended effects. If the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5550(b)(1) by November 12, 2024, Nasdaq will provide written notice that our\ncommon stock is subject to delisting. At such time, the Company would be entitled to appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearing Panel (the \"Panel\"). The\nhearing request would stay any suspension or delisting action pending the conclusion of the hearing process and expiration of any additional extension period granted by the\nPanel following the hearing.\nAny delisting of the Company’s common stock from Nasdaq, including as a result of its inability to regain compliance with Rule5 550(b)(1), could adversely affect the\nCompany’s ability to attract new investors, reduce the liquidity of its outstanding shares of common stock, reduce its ability to raise additional capital, reduce the price at\nwhich its common stock trades, result in negative publicity and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for the Company’s\nstockholders. The Company cannot assure its investors that its common stock, if delisted from Nasdaq, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an\nover-the-counter quotation system. In addition, delisting of the Company’s common stock could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or\ngenerating interest in the Company’s common stock and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in the Company’s securities at all. For these reasons and\nothers, delisting could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and liquidity.\n61\nITEM 2.
