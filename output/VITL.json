So, we collaborated with two of our favorite baking brands to dream up this gingerbread kit that celebrates a lesser-known tradition in the farming community called ‘raising the barn,’ where farmers come together to help a farmer build their barn,” said Kathryn McKeon, Vital Farms Chief Marketing Officer. “We hope people enjoy gifting this kit or ‘raising the gingerbread barn’ together with friends and family as much as we enjoyed bringing this to life with our friends Supernatural and King Arthur.”\n\n“This whimsical take on gingerbread is packed with the highest quality ingredients, delicious flavors, and seasonal charm,\" said Carmel Hagen, Founder, Supernatural. “From the chicken and cow cookies to the bright red barn blanketed in frosted ‘snow,’ this activity really delivers a farmhouse holiday right from the pasture.”\n\nThe simple ingredients and mixes included in the Gingerbread Farmhouse Kits are all free of the typical preservatives and artificial colors and flavors often found in the baking aisle, making it a holiday gift or activity you can feel good about sharing with your flock.\n\nVital Farms pasture-raised eggs and 90% grass-fed butter are produced by feathered girls and four-legged ladies who are treated with care and respect, with access to roam outside on fresh pastures. When mixed with King Arthur’s convenient gingerbread mix, full of flour spiced with molasses, ginger, and cinnamon, the resulting aromatic dough is the foundation of the gingerbread barn and hen and cow cookies. The cookies can ‘roam’ outside in the barn’s ‘pasture,’ just like Vital Farms hens and cows. Supernatural’s dye-free food colorings, made with vegetable-based ingredients like beet and spirulina, add vibrant color to King Arthur’s pre-measured icing mix, which serves as the sweet glue to raise the barn and adorn it and the cookies with flair. Supernatural’s dye-free Jingle Pop and Grassy Green sprinkles and melting morsels help bakers customize and further decorate their creations. \n\nGingerbread Farmhouse Kits are now available to purchase online for $65, while supplies last: [https://www.supernaturalkitchen.com/shop-supernatural/vital-farms-supernatural-farmhouse-holiday-gingerbread-kit](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=w2_qLxUrH62Ko7nhM5rNCh-JzhyyXwJfYHBsMzA6yG8wM2IzZUl59PCJYb_EjoEDHHgdciIkfgwgAXqiIZO6ICHQ2MSbKUp7KDOdbJXt9kz1sDzNZBEnyIhg5WhgnRoMiiDfQAls-NlNZI-t1THepdmRzzS96MLpU3MJFfAGe9e3Ffws30vE2Z5LNdwHHz2QNNhl0PSVUQlw-t-mr9wDqZj8jEoD8X_UCNCx5Nvvt2BXeIoorSbQbXAvRuM6c7_qNN-BbwrA_2u9oWEaaKNK1fRL6KyE9tpFWR9m2qCk5wkYYAvFhCWuO6VhkL6pIdZ7YjgbNpoJdHX2MasZPj-j-w==)\n\n**ABOUT VITAL FARMS:** Vital Farms (Nasdaq: VITL), a Certified B Corporation, offers a range of ethically produced foods nationwide.

Supernatural’s array of plant-based food colors, sprinkles, frostings, and rainbow baking chips are free of controversial artificial colors, preservatives, animal products, and the top eight most common food allergens, unlike old-school decorating supplies that have historically dominated the market. Each of Supernatural’s vibrant colors is developed using hyper-concentrated vegetables and spices, which allows for 300% more vibrancy while remaining odorless and tasteless, ready to top any sweet treat. Supernatural was launched in 2017 by Carmel Hagen with the modern baker in mind – from professional to first-time bakers – with the goal of providing better-for-you essentials that make every kitchen a classroom for creativity, healthy eating, and human connection. Supernatural products can be found in Sprouts Farmers Market, Whole Foods Market’s Northeast, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic regions (with select products available in additional locations), as well as on Amazon and Walmart.com. Supernatural products can also be found in select products from Milk Bar, Dr. Praeger’s, and more.

This great performance was made possible by all of the hardworking stakeholders across our organization who helped drive our mission of delivering ethical food to the table. Our appreciation goes out to our farmers, suppliers, customers, consumers, crew members, and stockholders who helped make this happen. Supported by our strong year-to-date performance and a positive outlook for the rest of the year, we are again raising our fiscal year 2024 expectations. Along with raising guidance, we are happy to report that we continue to invest in the long-term capacity of our business. We added to our network of now more than 375 family farms this quarter and our prep work for a new state-of-the-art egg washing and packing facility in Seymour, Indiana is well on track. These are exciting times for Vital Farms, and we are well on the road to meeting our $1 billion net revenue target by 2027,” said Russell Diez-Canseco, Vital Farms’ President and CEO.\n\n1Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below and is reconciled to net income, its closest comparable GAAP measure, at the end of this release.\n\n**_For the 13 Weeks Ended September 29, 2024_**\n\n**Net revenue** increased 31.3% to $145.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $110.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net revenue growth in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by volume-related revenue growth of 21.7% and price/mix benefits. Volume growth was driven by higher velocities on our current products, new offerings, and retail distribution gains with new and current customers.\n\n**Gross profit** was $53.5 million, or 36.9% of net revenue, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $36.7 million, or 33.2% of net revenue, in the prior year quarter. In-line with our performance in the first half of 2024, gross profit and gross margin growth was driven by higher net revenue, scale and price/mix benefits, operational efficiencies, and favorable conventional commodity and diesel costs. This was partially offset by an increase in promotions, as well as increased investment in crew members.\n\n**Income from operations** in the third quarter of 2024 was $9.2 million, compared to income from operations of $5.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. This performance was driven by higher sales and gross profit, partially offset by higher promotions and personnel and marketing investments.\n\n**Net income** was $7.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $4.5 million in the prior year quarter. The rise in net income was driven by higher sales and improved gross profit performance.\n\n**Net income per diluted share** was $0.16 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income per diluted share of $0.10 in the prior year quarter.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** was $15.2 million, or 10.5% of net revenue, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.3 million, or 8.4% of net revenue, in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by higher sales and gross profit, partially offset by new investments in marketing and employee-related expenses as we continue to scale a world-class organization.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below and is reconciled to net income, its closest comparable GAAP measure, at the end of this release.\n\n**_Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights_**\n\n**Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities** were $163.0 million as of September 29, 2024, and Vital Farms had no outstanding debt. Net cash provided by operating activities was $50.0 million for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $27.2 million for the 39-week period ended September 24, 2023.\n\n**Capital expenditures** totaled $10.5 million in the 39-week period ended September 29, 2024, compared to $9.1 million in the 39-week period ended September 24, 2023.\n\n**_Fiscal 2024 Outlook_**\n\nThilo Wrede, Vital Farms’ Chief Financial Officer, commented: “With another solid performance in the third quarter, I am pleased to again update our guidance for 2024. Our new outlook reflects the strong performance of the business for the first nine months of this year and our good visibility for the fourth quarter of 2024. Our revised guidance is built around a favorable commodity outlook and strong consumer demand supported by our marketing reinvestment strategy. Vital Farms’ long-term strategy is built to increase brand awareness, drive deeper loyalty with consumers, and grow our household penetration through focused energies on brand marketing and continuous retail expansion.”\n\nFor the fiscal year 2024, management now expects:\n\n  * Net revenue of at least $600 million, which represents at least 27% growth versus fiscal year 2023, compared to our previous expectation of at least $590 million, or 25% growth.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of at least $80 million, which represents at least 65% growth versus fiscal year 2023, compared to our previous expectation of at least $75 million, or 55% growth.\n  * Capital expenditures for the full year in the range of $30 million to $40 million, which is reduced from our previous range of $35 million to $45 million due to updated timing on some key projects. We continue to evaluate our capital allocation priorities, and we will provide updates as necessary in future earnings reports.\n\n\n\nVital Farms’ guidance includes the effect of lapping an extra shipping week in Q4 2023 and assumes that there are no significant disruptions to the supply chain or its customers or consumers, including any issues from adverse macroeconomic factors. Vital Farms cannot provide a reconciliation between its forecasted Adjusted EBITDA and net income and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and net income margin, their most directly comparable GAAP measures, without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for income taxes, among other items. These items are not within our control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.\n\n**_Conference Call and Webcast Details_**\n\nVital Farms will host a conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. ET today to discuss the results.

However, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, non-GAAP financial measures, provide investors with additional useful information in evaluating our performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are helpful to our investors as they are measures used by management in assessing the health of our business, determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude: (1) depreciation and amortization; (2) stock-based compensation expense; (3) (benefit) or provision for income taxes as applicable; (4) interest expense; and (5) interest income. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Net Revenue.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin include that (1) they do not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future, (2) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect these capital expenditures, (3) they do not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense, (4) they do not reflect other non-operating expenses, including interest expense; and (5) they do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. In addition, our use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the same manner, limiting the usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin alongside other financial measures, including our net income and other results stated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin to net income margin, the most directly comparable financial measures stated in accordance with GAAP, for the 13- and 39-week periods presented.\n\n**VITAL FARMS, INC.****ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION****(Amounts in thousands)****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**13-Weeks Ended**| **39-Weeks Ended**  \n**September 29,****2024**| **September 24,****2023**| **September 29,****2024**| **September 24,****2023**  \n**(in thousands)**| **(in thousands)**  \nNet income| $| 7,446| $| 4,523| $| 42,808| $| 18,356  \nDepreciation and amortization1| 3,330| 2,860| 9,829| 7,297  \nStock-based compensation expense| 2,674| 1,815| 7,572| 5,502  \nIncome tax provision| 2,936| 533| 10,410| 4,284  \nInterest expense| 259| 238| 771| 513  \nInterest income| (1,407| (707| )| (3,811| )| (1,497| )  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 15,238| $| 9,262| $| 67,579| $| 34,455  \nNet revenue| $| 145,002| $| 110,429| $| 440,318| $| 336,045  \nNet income margin2| 5.1| %| 4.1| %| 9.7| %| 5.5| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin3| 10.5| %| 8.4| %| 15.3| %| 10.3| %  \n1 Amount also includes finance lease amortization.  \n2 Net income margin is calculated by dividing net income by net revenue.  \n3 Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by net revenue.  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NjhmYzc1YzYtMTNlMC00YmQzLWE0ZmMtZDc3NDEwNDViZDMxLTEyMDY4MDY=/tiny/Vital-Farms.png)\n\nRequest Email Alerts\n\n[](#)\n\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://investors.vitalfarms.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vital-farms-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and&t=Vital Farms, Inc. - Vital Farms Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Raises Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook \"Facebook\")\n  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=Vital Farms, Inc. - Vital Farms Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Raises Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook+https://investors.vitalfarms.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vital-farms-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and \"Twitter\")\n  * [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://investors.vitalfarms.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vital-farms-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and&title=Vital Farms, Inc. - Vital Farms Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Raises Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [Google+](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://investors.vitalfarms.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vital-farms-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and?&t=Vital Farms, Inc. - Vital Farms Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Raises Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook \"GooglePlus\")\n\n\n"
