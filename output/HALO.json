(NASDAQ: HALO) (\"Halozyme\" or the \"Company\") today announced it has withdrawn its non-binding proposal to acquire Evotec SE (NASDAQ: EVO) (\"Evotec\") for €11.00 per share in cash, implying a fully diluted equity value of €2.0 billion. \n\n**Helen Torley,** **president and chief executive officer of Halozyme****, shared the following statement:**\n\n\"We continue to believe that a combination of Halozyme and Evotec would create a leading, differentiated, global pharma services company, benefitting shareholders, patients and employees. However, to date, Evotec has been unwilling to engage with us to explore a potential combination and a company spokesperson has publicly commented that its goal is to remain an independent company. As a result, we are withdrawing our proposal to acquire Evotec for €11.00 per share in cash.\n\nIn the months leading to our proposal, we engaged in extensive external diligence, and we sought to engage with Evotec in a discussion about our vision and the benefits for the combination. Early on, we had informal discussions with a member of the Supervisory Board and communicated our interest in exploring a potential business combination. Subsequently, we sought to earnestly engage Evotec's Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board on Halozyme's vision, and our thoughts as to the many benefits of the transaction; regrettably, our multiple requests to meet were not accepted. Thus, a formal bona fide proposal to the CEO was the only way to convey that our interest in exploring a potential transaction was strong, credible and well informed. It has now become evident that there is no interest at this time on the part of Evotec's Supervisory and Management Boards to engage constructively with Halozyme and explore a potential transaction.\n\nWe will continue advancing our mission to improve the patient treatment experience and we are confident in Halozyme's future. We believe that we are well-positioned to execute our existing strategy with clear line of sight to 10 approved products with ENHANZE® in 2025 and $1 billion of royalty revenue in 2027, continuing to deliver tremendous value for all stakeholders. We reiterate our recently raised 2024 guidance for revenue of $970-$1,020 million and adjusted EBITDA of $595-$625 million, representing significant double-digit growth, as we maintain strong momentum entering 2025.\"\n\nFor more information about Halozyme, its strategy, financials and capital allocation priorities, please visit [https://ir.halozyme.com/overview/default.aspx](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4310290-1&h=2239091832&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4305158-1%26h%3D1404921193%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fir.halozyme.com%252Foverview%252Fdefault.aspx%26a%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fir.halozyme.com%252Foverview%252Fdefault.aspx&a=https%3A%2F%2Fir.halozyme.com%2Foverview%2Fdefault.aspx).\n\n**About Halozyme**\n\nHalozyme is a biopharmaceutical company advancing disruptive solutions to improve patient experiences and outcomes for emerging and established therapies.

(NASDAQ: HALO) (\"Halozyme\" or the \"Company\") today provided an update on its non-binding proposal to acquire Evotec SE (NASDAQ: EVO) (\"Evotec\") for €11.00 per share in cash, implying a fully diluted equity value of €2.0 billion. In a presentation posted on its investor relations website, Halozyme highlights how its proposed combination with Evotec would create a leading global innovative pharma services company that would deliver significant value to all stakeholders.\n\n**The presentation highlights include:**\n\n**The acquisition of Evotec would be a logical extension and diversification of Halozyme's business, and is aligned with Halozyme's M &A criteria:**\n\n  * De-risked business: Evotec has a large, diverse revenue base with expected future revenue and margin expansion opportunities.\n  * Structurally similar business model: Evotec has a proprietary and innovative platform of technologies in drug discovery, development and biologic manufacturing.\n  * Strong biopharma partnerships: Evotec partners with more than 500 biopharma companies globally.\n  * Potential for durable long-term revenue growth: Evotec has platform opportunities and a pipeline that would be additive to future potential revenue streams.\n\n\n\n**The combination would create a unique B2B global innovative pharma services company with complementary and leverageable platforms and cross-selling opportunities:**\n\n  * Drug discovery: Evotec's Shared R&D platform is an established and comprehensive continuum of innovative discovery platform tools with a strong track record of success and more than 500 partners and 140+ partnered and unpartnered asset opportunities.\n  * Continuous biologics manufacturing: Just – Evotec Biologics is a pioneer in end-to-end continuous manufacturing, a breakthrough biologic manufacturing capability with 10 products in late-stage development and clinical manufacturing and more than 50 products in CMC development/IND enabling.\n  * Drug delivery: Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology is the leading, commercially-validated solution to facilitate the subcutaneous delivery of large volume injected biologic drugs, currently approved in eight products in more than 100 global markets, with expected near-term approvals, a robust pipeline in development and new deal opportunities.\n\n\n\n**The combination would****meaningfully diversify, scale and extend Halozyme's revenue and adjusted EBITDA well into the next decade and beyond.**\n\n  * Establishes a diversified pharma services portfolio with approximately $2 billion in annual revenue projected in 2025.\n  * Enhances long-term growth profile and maintains 15-20%+ 2023A – 2028E revenue CAGR while extending and accelerating growth into the next decade and beyond.\n  * Delivers robust long-term margin profile with a pro forma 45- 50% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2026 and significant cash flow generation over time.\n\n\n\n**The all-cash transaction would be supported by an existing lender group with a clear path to less than 2x net leverage within two years post-close.**\n\n  * Halozyme has significant cash reserves on-hand and a strong balance sheet with cash projected to be more than $800 million at year-end 2024.The transaction would not be subject to a financing condition.\n  * Halozyme is working with financing relationship partners on optimal financing structure and confirms equity will not be used to finance the transaction.\n  * Assuming a transaction is consummated, net debt on balance sheet at close would be approximately $3 billion, with a significant portion prepayable, and net leverage for funding at transaction close projected to be less than 4.75x.\n  * Net leverage is expected to decrease to less than 2x within two years post-close and quickly reducing meaningfully below that level through debt paydown and adjusted EBITDA growth, with additional multiple levers to further accelerate debt paydown over time.\n\n\n\nFor more information about Halozyme, its strategy, financials and capital allocation priorities, please visit [https://ir.halozyme.com/overview/default.aspx](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305158-1&h=1404921193&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.halozyme.com%2Foverview%2Fdefault.aspx&a=https%3A%2F%2Fir.halozyme.com%2Foverview%2Fdefault.aspx).\n\n**Advisors**\n\nCenterview Partners is serving as Halozyme's financial advisor and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, as legal advisor.\n\n**About Halozyme**\n\nHalozyme is a biopharmaceutical company advancing disruptive solutions to improve patient experiences and outcomes for emerging and established therapies.

Actual results could differ materially from the expectations contained in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including uncertainties concerning future matters such as market conditions, changes in domestic and foreign business changes in the competitive environment in which the Company and Evotec operate, discussions with Evotec and its board of directors, and financing a potential transaction, inability of the parties to successfully or timely enter into or consummate a transaction, including the risk that any required regulatory approvals are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely affect the combined group or the expected benefits of a transaction, unexpected levels of the combined group's revenues, expenditures and costs, unexpected results or delays in the growth of the combined group's business, or in the development, regulatory review or commercialization of the combined group's partnered or proprietary products, regulatory approval requirements, unexpected adverse events or patient outcomes and competitive conditions. These and other factors that may result in differences are discussed in greater detail in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no duty to update forward-looking statements to reflect events after the date of this release.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\nThese materials contain certain non-GAAP financial measures and projections. The Company reports Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and expectations of those measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

(NASDAQ: HALO) (“Halozyme” or the\n“Company”) today reported its financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30,\n2024, and provided an update on its recent corporate activities and outlook.\n“Our robust third quarter financial results highlight the strong execution and accelerating momentum we\nhave across our business and exceeded expectations with total revenue growth of 34% and adjusted\nEBITDA growth of 60%. Based on the strong performance year-to-date, we have raised our 2024\nguidance ranges and expect the advancement of our ENHANZE pipeline and new nominations from two\nglobal licensing agreements to support our future growth trajectory,” said Dr. Helen Torley, president and\nchief executive officer of Halozyme. “In the quarter, the announcement of two highly anticipated partner\napprovals in the U.S. for Roche’s TECENTRIQ HYBREZA and OCREVUS ZUNOVO reinforces\nENHANZE’s track record of 100% phase 3 study and subsequent regulatory success. The new\nnominations for ENHANZE from argenx, for a total of six targets, and ViiV Healthcare, for an additional\nundisclosed target, further demonstrate the value of our leading technology for rapid, large volume\nsubcutaneous delivery.”\nRecent Partner Highlights:\n• In October 2024, argenx initiated two studies evaluating VYVGART® Hytrulo with ENHANZE®, a\nPhase 3 study for adult patients with ocular myasthenia gravis (“oMG”) and a Phase 2 study for\nkidney transplant recipients with antibody mediated rejection (“AMR”).\n• In October 2024, Janssen announced the European Commission approved DARZALEX® SC for\nthe treatment of patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma (“NDMM”) who are eligible for\nautologous stem cell transplant (“ASCT”) in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and\ndexamethasone (“D-VRd”).\n• In September 2024, argenx expanded its global collaboration and license agreement nominating\nfour additional targets that provides them exclusive access to our ENHANZE® drug delivery\ntechnology for a total of six targets. Under the terms of the expanded exclusive agreement, we\nreceived upfront payments of $7.5 million per target nomination for a total of $30.0 million. argenx\nis obligated to make future milestone payments of up to $85.0 million per new nominated target,\nsubject to achievements of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. We\nare also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of commercialized products with our ENHANZE®\ntechnology.\n• In September 2024, ViiV expanded its global collaboration and license agreement providing ViiV\nthe ability to exclusively access our ENHANZE® drug delivery technology for one additional\nundisclosed target.\n• In September 2024, Roche announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved\nOCREVUS ZUNOVO™ with ENHANZE® as a twice a year ten-minute subcutaneous (“SC”)\ninjection for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis and primary progressive multiple\nsclerosis.\n• In September 2024, Roche announced the FDA approved TECENTRIQ HYBREZA™ with\nENHANZE® for all approved adult indications of intravenous (“IV”) TECENTRIQ® and was made\navailable to patients, resulting in a $12.0 million milestone payment.\n• In September 2024, Janssen announced the submission of a supplemental Biologic License\nApplication to the FDA for approval of a new indication of DARZALEX FASPRO® in combination\nwith D-VRd for the treatment of adult patients with NDMM for whom ASCT is deferred or who are\nineligible for ASCT.\n• In August 2024, the FDA designated Janssen’s Biologics License Application (“BLA”) priority\nreview status for amivantamab SC in combination with LAZCLUZE™ for currently approved or\nsubmitted indication of IV in certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\n• In August 2024, Takeda submitted a New Drug Application in Japan seeking approval for TAK-\n771 with ENHANZE® for treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating\npolyneuropathy/Multifocal Motor Neuropathy.\n• In July 2024, Janssen announced the FDA approved DARZALEX FASPRO® for an additional\nindication in NDMM patients who are eligible for ASCT in combination with D-VRd.\n• In July 2024, argenx announced the National Medical Products Administration approved the BLA\nof efgartigimod SC for generalized myasthenia gravis in China.\n• In July 2024, Acumen initiated a Phase 1 study of sabirnetug (“ACU193”) co-formulated with\nENHANZE® for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:\n• Revenue was $290.1 million, compared to $216.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. The 34%\nyear-over-year increase was primarily driven by royalty revenue growth and an increase in\nmilestone revenue. Revenue for the quarter included $155.1 million in royalties, an increase of\n36% compared to $114.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily attributable to increases in\nrevenue of DARZALEX® SC and Phesgo®, and the prior year launch of VYVGART® Hytrulo.\n• Cost of sales was $49.4 million, compared to $54.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily due to lower device and bulk rHuPH20 sales.\n• Amortization of intangibles expense was $17.8 million, compared to $20.3 million in the third\nquarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an impairment charge of $2.5 million\nrecognized in the prior year to fully impair the TLANDO® product rights intangible asset.\n• Research and development expense was $18.5 million, compared to $17.3 million in the third\nquarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased compensation expense.\n• Selling, general and administrative expense was $41.2 million, compared to $35.3 million in the\nthird quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased compensation expense and\nconsulting and professional service fees.\n• Operating income was $163.2 million, compared to $88.3 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n• Net Income was $137.0 million, compared to $81.8 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n• EBITDA was $183.6 million, compared to $124.6 million in the third quarter of 2023.

The increase was primarily a result of cash\ngenerated from operations.\nFinancial Outlook for 2024\nThe Company is raising its financial guidance for 2024. For the full year 2024, the Company expects:\n• Total revenue of $970 million to $1,020 million, representing growth of 17% to 23% over 2023\ntotal revenue primarily driven by increases in royalty revenue, collaboration revenue and growth\nin product sales from XYOSTED®. Revenue from royalties of $550 million to $565 million,\nrepresenting growth of 23% to 26% over 2023.\n• Adjusted EBITDA of $595 million to $625 million, representing growth of 40% to 47% over 2023.\n• Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.00 to $4.20, representing growth of 44% to 52%\nover 2023.

The Company reports earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and\namortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, and guidance\nwith respect to those measures, in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial\nmeasures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company calculates non-GAAP diluted earnings\nper share excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of debt discounts, intangible\nasset amortization, one-time changes in contingent liabilities, inventory adjustments, impairment\ncharges, and certain adjustments to income tax expense. The Company calculates non-GAAP diluted\nshares excluding the dilutive impact of convertible notes which is used in calculating non-GAAP diluted\nearnings. The Company calculates EBITDA excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nThe Company calculates adjusted EBITDA excluding one-time items such as changes in contingent\nliabilities and inventory adjustments. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures\nare included at the end of this press release. The Company does not provide reconciliations of forward-\nlooking adjusted measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain\namounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for\nchanges in share-based compensation expense and the effects of any discrete income tax items. The\nCompany evaluates other items of income and expense on an individual basis for potential inclusion in\nthe calculation of Non-GAAP financial measures and considers both the quantitative and qualitative\naspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to the Company’s ongoing\nbusiness operations and (iii) whether or not the Company expects it to occur as part of the Company’s\nnormal business on a regular basis. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other\ncompanies. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should\nbe read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP, and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In\naddition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the Company may exclude for\npurposes of its non-GAAP financial measures, and the Company may in the future cease to exclude\nitems that it has historically excluded for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. The Company\nconsiders these non-GAAP financial measures to be important because they provide useful measures\nof the operating performance of the Company, exclusive of factors that do not directly affect what the\nCompany considers to be its core operating performance, as well as unusual events. The non-GAAP\nmeasures also allow investors and analysts to make additional comparisons of the operating activities\nof the Company’s core business over time and with respect to other companies, as well as assessing\ntrends and future expectations. The Company uses non-GAAP financial information in assessing what\nit believes is a meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures to evaluate operating\ntrends, as well as in establishing portions of our performance-based incentive compensation programs.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nIn addition to historical information, the statements set forth in this press release include forward-looking\nstatements including, without limitation, statements concerning the Company’s financial performance\n(including the Company’s financial outlook for 2024) and expectations for future growth, profitability, total\nrevenue, royalty revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP diluted earnings-per-share.\nForward-looking statements regarding the Company’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology may include\nthe possible benefits and attributes of ENHANZE®, its potential application to aid in the dispersion and\nabsorption of other injected therapeutic drugs and facilitating more rapid delivery and administration of\nhigher volumes of injectable medications through subcutaneous delivery. Forward-looking statements\nregarding the Company’s business may include potential growth and receipt of royalty and milestone\npayments driven by our partners’ development and commercialization efforts, potential new clinical trial\nstudy starts and clinical data, regulatory submissions and product launches, the size and growth\nprospects of our partners’ drug franchises, potential new or expanded collaborations and collaborative\ntargets and regulatory review, and potential approvals of new partnered or proprietary products, and the\npotential timing of these events. These forward-looking statements are typically, but not always,\nidentified through use of the words “expect,” “believe,” “enable,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “intends,”\n“estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “predict,” “probable,” “potential,” “possible,” “should,” “continue,” and\nother words of similar meaning and involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those in the forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from the\nexpectations contained in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including\nunexpected levels of revenues, expenditures and costs, unexpected results or delays in the growth of\nthe Company’s business, or in the development, regulatory review or commercialization of the\nCompany’s partnered or proprietary products, regulatory approval requirements, unexpected adverse\nevents or patient outcomes and competitive conditions. These and other factors that may result in\ndifferences are discussed in greater detail in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K\nand Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as\nrequired by law, the Company undertakes no duty to update forward-looking statements to reflect events\nafter the date of this release.\nContacts:\nTram Bui\nVP, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications\n609-359-3016\ntbui@halozyme.com\nSamantha Gaspar\nTeneo\n212-886-9356\nsamantha.gaspar@teneo.com\nFootnotes:\n1.

financial statements.\n7\nHALOZYME THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n1. Organization and Business\nHalozyme Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company advancing disruptive solutions to improve patient experiences and outcomes for emerging and\nestablished therapies.\nAs the innovators of ENHANZE® drug delivery technology (“ENHANZE”) with our proprietary enzyme, rHuPH20, our commercially validated solution is\nused to facilitate the subcutaneous (“SC”) delivery of injected drugs and fluids with the goal of improving the patient experience with rapid SC delivery and\nreduced treatment burden. We license our technology to biopharmaceutical companies to collaboratively develop products that combine ENHANZE with our\npartners’ proprietary compounds. We also develop, manufacture and commercialize, for ourselves or with our partners, drug-device combination products using\nour advanced auto-injector technologies that are designed to provide commercial or functional advantages such as improved convenience, reliability and\ntolerability, and enhanced patient comfort and adherence.\nOur ENHANZE partners’ approved products and product candidates are based on rHuPH20, our patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme.\nrHuPH20 works by breaking down hyaluronan (“HA”), a naturally occurring carbohydrate that is a major component of the extracellular matrix of the SC space.\nThis temporarily reduces the barrier to bulk fluid flow allowing for improved and more rapid SC delivery of high dose, high volume injectable biologics, such as\nmonoclonal antibodies and other large therapeutic molecules, as well as small molecules and fluids. We refer to the application of rHuPH20 to facilitate the\ndelivery of other drugs or fluids as ENHANZE. We license our ENHANZE technology to form collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies that develop\nand/or market drugs requiring or benefiting from injection via the SC route of administration. In the development of proprietary intravenous (“IV”) drugs\ncombined with our ENHANZE technology, data has been generated supporting the potential for ENHANZE to reduce patient treatment burden, as a result of\nshorter duration of SC administration with ENHANZE compared to IV administration. ENHANZE may enable fixed-dose SC dosing compared to weight-based\ndosing typically required for IV administration, extend the dosing interval for drugs that are already administered subcutaneously and potentially allow for lower\nrates of infusion-related reactions. ENHANZE may enable more flexible treatment options such as home administration by a healthcare professional or potentially\nthe patient or caregiver. Lastly, certain proprietary drugs co-formulated with ENHANZE have been granted additional exclusivity, extending the patent life of the\nproduct beyond the patent expiry of the proprietary IV drug.\nWe currently have ENHANZE collaborations and licensing agreements with F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (“Roche”), Takeda\nPharmaceuticals International AG and Baxalta US Inc. (“Takeda”), Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”), Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), AbbVie, Inc. (“AbbVie”), Eli Lilly and\nCompany (“Lilly”), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), argenx BVBA (“argenx”), ViiV Healthcare (the global specialist HIV Company majority owned by\nGlaxoSmithKline) (“ViiV”), Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Chugai”) and Acumen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Acumen”). In addition to receiving upfront\nlicensing fees from our ENHANZE collaborations, we are entitled to receive event and sales-based milestone payments, revenues from the sale of bulk rHuPH20\nand royalties from commercial sales of approved partner products co-formulated with ENHANZE. We currently earn royalties from sales of eight commercial\nproducts including sales of one commercial product from each of the Takeda, Janssen and argenx collaborations and five commercial products from the Roche\ncollaboration.\nWe have commercialized auto-injector products with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (“Teva”) and Otter Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Otter”). We have\ndevelopment programs including auto-injectors with Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Idorsia”).\nOur commercial portfolio of proprietary products includes Hylenex®, utilizing rHuPH20, and XYOSTED®, utilizing our auto-injector technology.\nExcept where specifically noted or the context otherwise requires, references to “Halozyme,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” in these notes to our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements refer to Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. and each of its directly and indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries as disclosed in\nNote 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n8\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared for purposes of and in accordance with United States\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) related to a\nquarterly report on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for a complete set of financial\nstatements. These condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements\nand notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. The unaudited\nfinancial information for the interim periods presented herein reflects all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of\nthe financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented, with such adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments. Operating\nresults for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for an entire fiscal year.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries,\nHalozyme, Inc. and Antares Pharma, Inc., and Antares Pharma, Inc.’s wholly owned Swiss subsidiaries, Antares Pharma IPL AG and Antares Pharma AG. All\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments,\nwhich are based on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By\ntheir nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and, as such, actual results may differ from our estimates.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, readily convertible to cash, which mature within 90 days or less from the date of purchase. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents consisted of money market funds, bank certificate of deposits and demand deposits at commercial banks.\nMarketable securities are investments with original maturities of more than 90 days from the date of purchase that are specifically identified to fund current\noperations. Marketable securities are considered available-for-sale. These investments are classified as current assets, even though the stated maturity date may be\none year or more beyond the current balance sheet date which reflects management’s intention to use the proceeds from the sale of these investments to fund our\noperations, as necessary. Such available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income and\nincluded as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts to\nmaturity, and such amortization or accretion is included in investment and other income, net in our condensed consolidated statements of income. We use the\nspecific identification method for calculating realized gains and losses on marketable securities sold. None of the realized gains and losses and declines in value\nthat were judged to be as a result of credit loss on marketable securities, if any, are included in investment and other income, net in our condensed consolidated\nstatements of income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.\nThese tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active\nmarkets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an\nentity to develop its own assumptions.\nOur financial instruments include cash equivalents, available-for-sale marketable securities, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts\npayable, accrued expenses and long-term debt. Fair value estimates of these instruments are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information.\nThese estimates may be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. The\ncarrying amount of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses are generally considered to be\nrepresentative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of those instruments.\n9\nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities consist of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury securities, agency bonds and commercial\npaper, and are measured at fair value using Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. Level 2 financial instruments are valued using market prices on less active markets and\nproprietary pricing valuation models with observable inputs, including interest rates, yield curves, maturity dates, issue dates, settlement dates, reported trades,\nbroker-dealer quotes, issue spreads, benchmark securities or other market related data. We obtain the fair value of Level 2 investments from our investment\nmanager, who obtains these fair values from a third-party pricing source. We validate the fair values of Level 2 financial instruments provided by our investment\nmanager by comparing these fair values to a third-party pricing source.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable is recorded at the invoiced amount and is non-interest bearing. Accounts receivable is recorded net of estimated prompt pay discounts,\ndistribution fees and chargebacks. We believe the risk of accounts being uncollectible is minimal; therefore, no significant allowances for doubtful accounts were\nestablished as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Net realizable value is the estimated selling\nprice in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Inventories are reviewed periodically for\npotential excess, dated or obsolete status. We evaluate the carrying value of inventories on a regular basis, taking into account such factors as historical and\nanticipated future sales compared to quantities on hand, the price we expect to obtain for products in their respective markets compared with historical cost and the\nremaining shelf life of goods on hand.\nLeases\nWe have entered into operating leases primarily for real estate and automobiles. These leases have contractual terms which range from three years to twelve\nyears. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Right of use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities resulting from operating leases are included in\nproperty and equipment, accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities\nare recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of our leases do not provide\nan implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the discount rate to calculate the\npresent value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs\nincurred. Our leases often include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise that option. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Lease expense for\nminimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain leases, such as automobiles, we\naccount for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, including ROU assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Equipment is depreciated using the\nstraight-line method over its estimated useful life ranging from three years to ten years and leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method\nover the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, whichever is shorter.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe account for long-lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed\nfor events or changes in circumstances, which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during the period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.\n10\nConvertible Notes\nThe 2024 Convertible Notes, the 2027 Convertible Notes and the 2028 Convertible Notes (collectively, the “Convertible Notes”) are accounted for in\naccordance with authoritative guidance for debt and derivatives. We evaluate all the embedded conversion options contained in the Convertible Notes to determine\nif there are embedded features that require bifurcation as a derivative as required by U.S. GAAP. Based on our analysis, we account for each of our Convertible\nNotes as single units of accounting, a liability, because we concluded that the conversion features do not require bifurcation as a derivative under embedded\nderivative authoritative guidance.\nCash Flow Hedges - Currency Risks\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2023, we entered into a cash flow hedging program to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with forecasted\nroyalty revenue denominated in Swiss francs. Under the program, we can hedge these forecasted royalties up to a maximum of four years into the future. We\nhedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk of our earnings and cash flows being adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.\nIn accordance with the hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge and are highly effective\nin offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. Both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, we assess whether the foreign currency\nforward contracts are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items on a prospective and retrospective basis. If we determine a (i) foreign\ncurrency forward contract is not highly effective as a cash flow hedge, (ii) foreign currency forward contract has ceased to be a highly effective hedge or (iii)\nforecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we would discontinue hedge accounting treatment prospectively. We measure effectiveness based on the\nchange in fair value of the forward currency forward contract and the fair value of the hypothetical foreign currency forward contract with terms that match the\ncritical terms of the risk being hedged. No portion of our foreign currency forward contracts were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, all hedges were determined to be highly effective.\nThe assets or liabilities associated with our hedging contracts are recorded at fair market value in prepaid expense and other current assets, accrued expenses,\nor other long-term liabilities, respectively, in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses related to changes in the fair market value of these\nhedging contracts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) within stockholder’s equity in our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets and reclassified to royalty revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of income in the same period as the recognition of the\nunderlying hedged transaction. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, within the defined\nhedge period, we reclassify the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedge from AOCI to royalties revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of income.\nSettlements from the cash flow hedge are included in operating activities on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Since the fair market value of\nthese hedging contracts is derived from current market rates, the hedging contracts are classified as derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivatives for\nspeculative or trading purposes. As of September 30, 2024, amounts expected to be recognized as a net gain out of AOCI into our condensed consolidated\nstatements of income during the next 12 months are not material.\nBusiness Combinations\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. These valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. We record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets, net of liabilities\nassumed, as goodwill. Costs incurred to complete a business combination, such as legal and other professional fees, are expensed as incurred.\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report\nprovisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect\nnew information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts\nrecognized as of that date. We record these adjustments to the provisional amounts with a corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments identified after the\nmeasurement period are recorded in our condensed consolidated statements of income.\n11\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Asset\nAssets acquired, including intangible assets and in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value as of the\nacquisition date. Goodwill, which has an indefinite useful life, represents the excess of cost over fair value of the net assets acquired. Intangible assets acquired in\na business combination that are used for IPR&D activities are considered indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and\ndevelopment efforts. Upon reaching the end of the relevant research and development project (i.e., upon commercialization), the IPR&D asset is amortized over its\nestimated useful life. If the relevant research and development project is abandoned, the IPR&D asset is expensed in the period of abandonment.\nGoodwill and IPR&D are not amortized; however, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually during the second quarter, or more frequently if an\nevent occurs indicating the potential for impairment. Goodwill and IPR&D are considered to be impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit or IPR&D asset\nexceeds its respective fair value.\nWe perform our goodwill impairment analysis at the reporting unit level, which aligns with our reporting and operating segment structure and availability of\ndiscrete financial information. During the goodwill impairment review, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalues of our reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions,\nindustry and market considerations, and our overall financial performance. If, after assessing the totality of these qualitative factors, we determine that it is not\nmore likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than the carrying amounts, then no additional assessment is deemed necessary. Otherwise, we\nproceed to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds\nthe fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in a period and proceed to perform the\nquantitative goodwill impairment test.\nOur identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives are typically comprised of acquired device technologies and product rights. The cost of identifiable\nintangible assets with finite lives is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets’ respective estimated useful lives.\nWe perform regular reviews to determine if any event has occurred that may indicate intangible assets with finite useful lives and other long-lived assets are\npotentially impaired. If indicators of impairment exist, an impairment test is performed to assess the recoverability of the affected assets by determining whether\nthe carrying amount of such assets exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the affected assets are not recoverable, we estimate the fair value of the\nassets and record an impairment loss if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. Factors that may indicate potential impairment include a significant\ndecline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to the net book value, significant changes in the ability of a particular asset to generate positive cash\nflows for our strategic business objectives, and the pattern of utilization of a particular asset.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenues from payments received (i) as royalties from licensing our ENHANZE technology and other royalty arrangements, (ii) under\ncollaborative agreements and (iii) from sales of our proprietary and partnered products. We recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to\ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition\nfor contracts with customers, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) identify the performance\nobligations in the contract, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including the constraint on\nvariable consideration; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the\nperformance obligations.\nENHANZE and Device Royalties\nUnder the terms of our ENHANZE collaboration and license agreements, our partners will pay us royalties at an on average mid-single digit percent rate of\ntheir sales if products under the collaboration are commercialized. All amounts owed to us are noncancelable after the underlying triggering event occurs, and\nnonrefundable once paid. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, collaborations generally continue in effect until the last to expire royalty payment\nterm, as determined on a product by product and country by country basis, with each royalty term starting on the first commercial sale of that product and ending\nthe later of: (i) a specified period or term set forth in the agreement or (ii) expiration of the last to expire of the valid claims of our patents covering rHuPH20 or\nother specified patents developed under the collaboration which valid claim covers a product developed under the collaboration. In general, when there are no\nvalid claims of a specified patent developed under the collaboration covering the product in a given country, the royalty rate is reduced for those sales in that\ncountry upon the expiration of our patents covering rHuPH20. Janssen’s patents covering DARZALEX SC do not impact the timing for this royalty reduction.\nPartners may terminate the agreement prior to expiration for any reason in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis generally upon 90 days prior written notice to\nus. Upon any such termination, the license granted to\n12\npartners (in total or with respect to the terminated target, as applicable) will terminate provided; however, that in the event of expiration of the agreement (as\nopposed to a termination), the on-going licenses granted may become perpetual, non-exclusive and fully paid. Sales-based milestones and royalties are recognized\nin the period the underlying sales or milestones occur. We do not receive final royalty reports from our ENHANZE partners until after we complete our financial\nstatements for a prior quarter. Therefore, we recognize revenue based on estimates of the royalty earned, which are based on internal estimates and available\npreliminary reports provided by our partners. We will record adjustments in the following quarter, if necessary, when final royalty reports are received. To date, we\nhave not recorded any material adjustments.\nWe also earn royalties in connection with several of our licenses granted under license and development arrangements with our device partners. These\nroyalties are based upon a percentage of commercial sales of partnered products with rates ranging from mid-single digits to low double digits and are tiered based\non levels of net sales. These sales-based royalties, for which the license was deemed the predominant element to which the royalties relate, are estimated and\nrecognized in the period in which the partners’ commercial sales occur. The royalties are generally reported and payable to us within 45 to 60 days after the end of\nthe period in which the commercial sales are made. We base our estimates of royalties earned on actual sales information from our partners when available or\nestimated prescription sales from external sources and estimated net selling price. We will record adjustments in the following quarter, if necessary, when final\nroyalty reports are received. To date, we have not recorded any material adjustments.\nRevenue under ENHANZE and Device Collaborative Agreements\nENHANZE Collaboration and License Agreements\nUnder these agreements, we grant the collaboration partner a worldwide license to develop and commercialize products using our ENHANZE technology to\ncombine our patented rHuPH20 enzyme with their proprietary biologics directed at up to a specified number of targets. Targets are usually licensed on an\nexclusive, global basis. Targets selected subsequent to inception of the arrangement generally require payment of an additional license fee. The collaboration\npartner is responsible for all development, manufacturing, clinical, regulatory, sales and marketing costs for any products developed under the agreement. We are\nresponsible for supply of bulk rHuPH20 based on the collaboration partner’s purchase orders, and may also be separately engaged to perform research and\ndevelopment services. While these collaboration agreements are similar in that they originate from the same framework, each one is the result of an arms-length\nnegotiation and thus may vary from one to the other.\nWe generally collect an upfront license payment from collaboration partners, and are also entitled to receive event-based payments subject to collaboration\npartners’ achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. In several agreements, collaboration partners pay us annual fees to\nmaintain their exclusive license rights if they are unable to advance product development to specified stages. We earn separate fees for bulk rHuPH20 supplies and\nresearch and development services.\nAlthough these agreements are in form identified as collaborative agreements, we concluded for accounting purposes they represent contracts with customers\nand are not subject to accounting literature on collaborative arrangements. This is because we grant to partners licenses to our intellectual property and provide\nsupply of bulk rHuPH20 and research and development services which are all outputs of our ongoing activities, in exchange for respective consideration. Under\nthese collaborative agreements, our partners lead development of assets, and we do not share in significant financial risks of their development or\ncommercialization activities. Accordingly, we concluded our collaborative agreements are appropriately accounted for pursuant to U.S. GAAP.\nUnder all of our ENHANZE collaborative agreements, we have identified licenses to use functional intellectual property as the only performance obligation.\nThe intellectual property underlying the license is our proprietary ENHANZE technology which represents application of rHuPH20 to facilitate delivery of drugs.\nEach of the licenses grants the partners rights to use our intellectual property as it exists and is identified on the effective date of the license, because there is no\nongoing development of the ENHANZE technology required. Therefore, we recognize revenue from licenses at the point when the license becomes effective and\nthe partner has received access to our intellectual property, usually at the inception of the agreement.\nWhen partners can select additional targets to add to the licenses granted, we consider these rights to be options. We evaluate whether such options contain\nmaterial rights, i.e. have exercise prices that are discounted compared to what we would charge for a similar license to a new partner. The exercise price of these\noptions includes a combination of the target selection fees, event-based milestone payments and royalties. When these amounts in aggregate are not offered at a\ndiscount that exceeds discounts available to other customers, we conclude the option does not contain a material right, and we consider grants of additional\nlicensing rights upon option exercises to be separate contracts (target selection contracts).\nGenerally, we provide indemnification and protection of licensed intellectual property for our customers. These provisions are part of assurance that the\nlicenses meet the agreements’ representations and are not obligations to provide goods or services.\n13\nWe also fulfill purchase orders for supply of bulk rHuPH20 and perform research and development services pursuant to project authorization forms for our\npartners, which represent separate contracts. In addition to our licenses, we price our supply of bulk rHuPH20 and research and development services at our\nregular selling prices, called standalone selling prices (“SSP”). Therefore, our partners do not have material rights to order these items at prices not reflective of\nSSP. Refer to the discussion below regarding recognition of revenue for these separate contracts.\nTransaction price for a contract represents the amount to which we are entitled in exchange for providing goods and services to the customer. Transaction\nprice does not include amounts subject to uncertainties unless it is probable that there will be no significant reversal of revenue when the uncertainty is resolved.\nApart from the upfront license payment (or target selection fees in the target selection contracts), all other fees we may earn under our collaborative agreements are\nsubject to significant uncertainties of product development. Achievement of many of the event-based development and regulatory milestones may not be probable\nuntil such milestones are actually achieved. This generally relates to milestones such as obtaining marketing authorization approvals. With respect to other\ndevelopment milestones, e.g., dosing of a first patient in a clinical trial, achievement could be considered probable prior to its actual occurrence, based on the\nprogress towards commencement of the trial. In order to evaluate progress towards commencement of a trial, we assess the status of activities leading up to our\npartner’s initiation of a trial such as feedback received from the applicable regulatory authorities, completion of Investigational New Drug (“IND”) or equivalent\nfilings, readiness and availability of drug, readiness of study sites and our partner’s commitment of resources to the program. We do not include any amounts\nsubject to uncertainties in the transaction price until it is probable that the amount will not result in a significant reversal of revenue in the future. At the end of\neach reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the\noverall transaction price.\nWhen target exchange rights are held by partners, and the amounts attributed to these rights are not refundable, they are included in the transaction price.\nHowever, they are recorded as deferred revenues because we have a potential performance obligation to provide a new target upon an exchange right being\nexercised. These amounts are recognized in revenue when the right of exchange expires or is exercised.\nBecause our agreements have one type of performance obligation (licenses) which are typically all transferred at the same time at agreement inception,\nallocation of transaction price often is not required. However, allocation is required when licenses for some of the individual targets are subject to rights of\nexchange, because revenue associated with these targets cannot be recognized. When allocation is needed, we perform an allocation of the upfront amount based\non relative SSP of licenses for individual targets. We determine license SSP using an income-based valuation approach utilizing risk-adjusted discounted cash flow\nprojections of the estimated return a licensor would receive where applicable or an alternative valuation method such as indicative value from historical\ntransactions. When amounts subject to uncertainties, such as milestones and royalties, are included in the transaction price, we attribute them to the specific\nindividual target licenses which generate such milestone or royalty amounts.\nWe also estimate SSP of bulk rHuPH20 and research and development services, to determine that our partners do not have material rights to order them at\ndiscounted prices. For supplies of bulk rHuPH20, because we effectively act as a contract manufacturer to our partners, we estimate and charge SSP based on the\ntypical contract manufacturer margins consistent with all of our partners. We determine SSP of research and development services based on a fully-burdened labor\nrate. Our rates are comparable to those we observe in other collaborative agreements. We also have a history of charging similar rates to all of our partners.\nUpfront amounts allocated to licenses to individual targets are recognized as revenue when the license is transferred to the partner, as discussed above, if the\nlicense is not subject to exchange rights, or when the exchange right expires or is exercised. Development milestones and other fees are recognized in revenue\nwhen they are included in the transaction price, because by that time, we have already transferred the related license to the partner.\nIn contracts to provide research and development services, such services represent the only performance obligation. The fees are charged based on hours\nworked by our employees and the fixed contractual rate per hour, plus third-party pass-through costs, on a monthly basis. We recognize revenues as the related\nservices are performed based on the amounts billed, as the partner consumes the benefit of research and development work simultaneously as we perform these\nservices, and the amounts billed reflect the value of these services to the customer.\nDevice License, Development and Supply Arrangements\nWe have several license, development and supply arrangements with pharmaceutical partners, under which we grant a license to our device technology and\nprovide research and development services that often involve multiple performance obligations and highly-customized deliverables. For such arrangements, we\nidentify each of the promised goods and services within the contract and the distinct performance obligations at inception of the contract and allocate consideration\nto each performance obligation based on relative SSP, which is generally determined based on the expected cost plus mark-up.\n14\nIf the contract includes an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance obligations are satisfied over time, we recognize\nrevenue over the development period using either the input or output method depending on which is most appropriate given the nature of the distinct deliverable.\nFor other contracts that do not contain an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue is recognized when control of the product is\ntransferred to the customer. Factors that may indicate transfer of control has occurred include the transfer of legal title, transfer of physical possession, the\ncustomer has obtained the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the assets, and we have a present right to payment.\nOur payment terms for development contracts may include an upfront payment equal to a percentage of the total contract value with the remaining portion to\nbe billed upon completion and transfer of the individual deliverables or satisfaction of the individual performance obligations. We record a contract liability for\ncash received in advance of performance, which is presented as deferred revenue within accrued expense and other long-term liabilities in our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of income when the associated performance obligations have\nbeen satisfied.\nLicense fees and milestones received in exchange for the grant of a license to our functional intellectual property, such as patented technology and know-how\nin connection with a partnered development arrangement, are generally recognized at inception of the arrangement, or over the development period depending on\nthe facts and circumstances, as the license is generally not distinct from the non-licensed goods or services to be provided under the contract. Milestone payments\nthat are contingent upon the occurrence of future events are evaluated and recorded at the most likely amount, and to the extent that it is probable that a significant\nreversal of revenue will not occur when the associated uncertainty is resolved.\nRefer to Note 4, Revenue, for further discussion on our collaborative arrangements.\nProduct Sales, Net\nProprietary Product Sales\nOur commercial portfolio of proprietary products includes XYOSTED and Hylenex recombinant which we sell primarily to wholesale pharmaceutical\ndistributors and specialty pharmacies, who sell the products to hospitals, retail chain drug stores and other end-user customers. Sales to wholesalers are made\npursuant to purchase orders subject to the terms of a master agreement, and delivery of individual packages of products represents performance obligations under\neach purchase order. We use contract manufacturers to produce our proprietary products and third-party logistics (“3PL”) vendors to process and fulfill orders. We\nconcluded we are the principal in the sales to wholesalers because we control access to services rendered by both vendors and direct their activities. We have no\nobligations to wholesalers to generate pull-through sales.\nRevenue is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which is typically upon delivery, at the net selling price, which reflects the variable\nconsideration for which reserves and sales allowances are established for estimated returns, wholesale distribution fees, prompt payment discounts, government\nrebates and chargebacks, plan rebate arrangements and patient discount and support programs. We recognize revenue from product sales and related cost of sales\nupon product delivery to the wholesaler location. At that time, the wholesalers take control of the product as they take title, bear the risk of loss of ownership, and\nhave an enforceable obligation to pay us. They also have the ability to direct sales of product to their customers on terms and at prices they negotiate. Although\nwholesalers have product return rights, we do not believe they have a significant incentive to return the product to us.\nThe determination of certain reserves and sales allowances requires us to make a number of judgements and estimates to reflect our best estimate of the\ntransaction price and the amount of consideration to which we believe we would be ultimately entitled to receive. The expected value is determined based on unit\nsales data, contractual terms with customers and third-party payers, historical and estimated future percentage of rebates incurred on sales, historical and future\ninsurance plan billings, any new or anticipated changes in programs or regulations that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, customer purchasing\npatterns, product expiration dates and levels of inventory in the distribution channel. The estimated amounts of credit for product returns, chargebacks, distribution\nfees, prompt payment discounts, rebates and customer co-pay support programs are included in accrued expenses and accounts receivable, net in our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets upon recognition of revenue from product sales. We monitor actual product returns, chargebacks, discounts and fees subsequent to the\nsale. If these amounts differ from our estimates, we make adjustments to these allowances, which are applied to increase or reduce product sales revenue and\nearnings in the period of adjustment.\nSelling prices initially billed to wholesalers are subject to discounts for prompt payment and subsequent chargebacks when wholesalers sell our products at\nnegotiated discounted prices to members of certain group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), Pharmacy Benefit Managers (“PBMs”) and government programs.\nWe also pay quarterly distribution fees to certain wholesalers for inventory reporting and chargeback processing, and to PBMs and GPOs as administrative fees for\nservices and for access to their members. We concluded the benefits received in exchange for these fees are not distinct from our sales of our products, and\naccordingly we apply these amounts to reduce revenues. Wholesalers also have rights to return unsold product\n15\nnearing or past the expiration date. Because of the shelf life of our products and our lengthy return period, there may be a significant period of time between when\nthe product is shipped and when we issue credits on returned product.\nWe estimate the transaction price when we receive each purchase order taking into account the expected reductions of the selling price initially billed to the\nwholesaler arising from all of the above factors. We have compiled historical experience and data to estimate future returns and chargebacks of our products and\nthe impact of the other discounts and fees we pay. When estimating these adjustments to the transaction price, we reduce it sufficiently to be able to assert that it is\nprobable that there will be no significant reversal of revenue when the ultimate adjustment amounts are known.\nEach purchase order contains only one type of product, and is usually shipped to the wholesaler in a single shipment. Therefore, allocation of the transaction\nprice to individual packages is not required.\nIn connection with the orders placed by wholesalers, we incur costs such as commissions to our sales representatives. However, as revenue from product\nsales is recognized upon delivery to the wholesaler, which occurs shortly after we receive a purchase order, we do not capitalize these commissions and other\ncosts, based on application of the practical expedient allowed within the applicable guidance.\nPartnered Product Sales\nBulk rHuPH20\nWe sell bulk rHuPH20 to partners for use in research and development and, subsequent to receiving marketing approval, we sell it for use in collaboration\ncommercial products. Sales are made pursuant to purchase orders subject to the terms of the collaborative agreement or a supply agreement, and delivery of units\nof bulk rHuPH20 represent performance obligations under each purchase order. We provide a standard warranty that the product conforms to specifications. We\nuse contract manufacturers to produce bulk rHuPH20 and have concluded we are the principal in the sales to partners. The transaction price for each purchase\norder of bulk rHuPH20 is fixed based on the cost of production plus a contractual markup, and is not subject to adjustments. Allocation of the transaction price to\nindividual quantities of the product is usually not required because each order contains only one type of product.\nWe recognize revenue from the sale of bulk rHuPH20 as product sales and related cost of sales upon transfer of title to our partners. At that time, the partners\ntake control of the product, bear the risk of loss of ownership, and have an enforceable obligation to pay us.\nDevices\nWe are party to several license, development, supply and distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical partners, under which we produce and are the\nexclusive supplier of certain products, devices and/or components. Revenue is recognized when or as control of the goods transfers to the customer as discussed\nbelow.\nWe are the exclusive supplier of OTREXUP® to Otter. Because this product is custom manufactured with no alternative use and we have a contractual right\nto payment for performance completed to date, control is continuously transferred to the customer as the product is produced pursuant to firm purchase orders.\nRevenue is recognized over time using the output method based on the contractual selling price and number of units produced. The amount of revenue recognized\nin excess of the amount shipped/billed to the customer, if any, is recorded as contract assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets due to the short-term\nnature in which the amount is ultimately expected to be billed and collected from the customer.\nOther device partnered product sales are recognized at the point in time in which control is transferred to the customer, which is typically upon shipment.\nSales terms and pricing are governed by the respective supply and distribution agreements, and there is generally no right of return. Revenue is recognized at the\ntransaction price, which includes the contractual per unit selling price and estimated variable consideration, such as volume-based pricing arrangements, if any. We\nrecognize revenue, including the estimated variable consideration we expect to receive for contract margin on future commercial sales, upon shipment of the goods\nto our partner. The estimated variable consideration is recognized at an amount we believe is not subject to significant reversal of revenue based on historical\nexperience and is adjusted at each reporting period if the most likely amount of expected consideration changes or becomes fixed.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consists primarily of raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs, fill and finish costs, freight costs, internal costs and manufacturing\noverhead associated with the production of proprietary and partnered products. Cost of sales also consists of the write-down of excess, dated and obsolete\ninventories and the write-off of inventories that do not meet certain product specifications, if any.\n16\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses include salaries and benefits, allocation of facilities and other overhead expenses, research related manufacturing\nservices, contract services, and other outside expenses related to manufacturing, preclinical and regulatory activities and our partner development platforms.\nResearch and development expenses are charged to operating expenses as incurred when these expenditures relate to our research and development efforts and\nhave no alternative future uses.\nWe are obligated to make upfront payments upon execution of certain research and development agreements. Advance payments, including nonrefundable\namounts, for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred. Such amounts are recognized as expense\nas the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed or such time when we do not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be performed.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe record compensation expense associated with stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance stock units (“PSUs”) and shares issued under\nour employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based compensation. The cost of employee services received\nin exchange for an award of an equity instrument is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Share-based compensation expense for an award with a performance condition is recognized\nwhen the achievement of such performance condition is determined to be probable. If the outcome of such performance condition is not determined to be probable\nor is not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. Forfeitures are recognized as a reduction\nof share-based compensation expense as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences\nbetween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases at each reporting period. We measure deferred tax\nassets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Significant judgment is required by management to\ndetermine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any associated valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax\nassets. Deferred tax assets (“DTA”) and other tax benefits are recorded when they are more likely than not to be realized. On a quarterly basis, we assess the need\nfor valuation allowance on our DTAs, weighing all positive and negative evidence, to assess if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of our DTAs will be\nrealized. We recorded a provision for income tax of $28.1 million and $71.8 million with an effective tax rate of 17.1% and 19.0% for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively. The difference between our effective tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% is primarily due to a decrease\nfrom a share-based compensation windfall tax benefit, Foreign Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) deduction, and research and development credit generation,\npartially offset by state income tax and Section 162(m) disallowance.\nSegment Information\nWe operate our business in one operating segment, which includes all activities related to the research, development and commercialization of our\nproprietary enzymes and devices. This segment also includes revenues and expenses related to (i) research and development and manufacturing activities\nconducted under our collaborative agreements with third parties, and (ii) product sales of proprietary and partnered products. The chief operating decision-maker\n(“CODM”), our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), reviews the operating results on an aggregate basis and manages the operations as a single operating segment.\n17\nAdoption and Pending Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following table provides a brief description of recently issued accounting standards, those adopted in the current period and those not yet adopted:\nStandard Description Effective Date Adoption Method Effect on the Financial\nStatements or Other Significant\nMatters\nIn November 2023, the The new guidance is intended to Annual periods Retrospective We do not expect the standard to\nFinancial Accounting improve annual and interim reportable beginning after have a material effect on our\nStandards Board (“FASB”) segment disclosure requirements December 15, 2023 consolidated financial statements,\nissued Accounting regardless of number of reporting (our 2024 Form 10- but will result in expanded segment\nStandards Update (“ASU”) units, primarily through enhanced K), and interim disclosures.\n2023-07, Segment disclosures of significant expenses. periods within fiscal\nReporting (Topic 280): The amendment requires public years beginning after\nImprovements to Reportable entities to disclose significant segment December 15, 2024\nSegment Disclosures. expenses that are regularly provided (our Q1 2025 Form\nto the CODM and included within 10-Q) - Early adoption\neach reported measure of segment is permitted, including\nprofit and loss. adoption in an interim\nperiod\nIn December 2023, the The new guidance includes Annual periods Prospective or We are currently evaluating the\nFASB issued ASU 2023-09, amendments that further enhance beginning after Retrospective impact of the standard on our\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): income tax disclosures, primarily December 15, 2024 consolidated financial statements\nImprovements to Income through standardization and (our 2025 Form 10-K) and related disclosures.\nTax Disclosures. disaggregation of rate reconciliation - Early adoption is\ncategories and income taxes paid by permitted\njurisdiction.\n18\n3.

Long-Term Debt, Net\n1.00% Convertible Notes due 2028\nIn August 2022, we completed the sale of $720.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Convertible\nNotes”). The net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers’ fee of $18.0 million, was\napproximately $702.0 million. We also incurred additional debt issuance costs totaling $1.0 million. Debt issuance costs and the initial purchasers’ fee are\npresented as a debt discount.\nThe 2028 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears on February 15th and August 15th of each year at an annual rate of 1.00%. The 2028\nConvertible Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to\nthe 2028 Convertible Notes, rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, are effectively junior to any\nsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities\n(including trade payables) of our current or future subsidiaries. The 2028 Convertible Notes have a maturity date of August 15, 2028.\nHolders may convert their 2028 Convertible Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the\ncalendar quarter ending on December 31, 2022, if the last reported sale price per share of common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least\n20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the\nfive consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in\nwhich the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported\nsale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or\ndistributions on our common stock, as described in the offering memorandum for the 2028 Convertible Notes; (4) if we call such notes for redemption; and (5) at\nany time from, and including, February 15, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the 2028 Convertible Notes were not convertible.\nUpon conversion, we will pay cash for the settlement of principal, and for the premium, if applicable, we will pay cash, deliver shares of common stock or a\ncombination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate for the 2028 Convertible Notes is 17.8517 shares of common stock\nper $1,000 in principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $56.02 per share of our common stock. The\nconversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued or unpaid interest.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants and there was no material adverse change in our business, operations or financial\ncondition.\nCapped Call Transactions\nIn connection with the offering of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the “Capped Call\nTransactions”). The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon conversion of the 2028\nConvertible Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of such\nconverted 2028 Convertible Notes. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is initially $75.4075 per share of common stock, representing a premium of 75%\nabove the last reported sale price of $43.09 per share of common stock on August 15, 2022, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped\nCall Transactions. As of September 30, 2024, no capped calls had been exercised.\nPursuant to their terms, the capped calls qualify for classification within stockholders’ equity in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, and their fair\nvalue is not remeasured and adjusted as long as they continue to qualify for stockholders’ equity classification. We paid approximately $69.1 million for the\nCapped Calls, including applicable transaction costs, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions entered into by us with the capped call Counterparties, are not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes,\nand do not affect any holder’s rights under the Convertible Notes.

Concurrently, with the entry into the Amendment, we repaid the entire outstanding Term Loan Facility and repaid all outstanding\nloans under the Revolving Credit Facility under the 2022 Credit Agreement. The 2022 Facility will mature on November 30, 2026 unless either the Revolving\nCredit Facility or the Term Facility is extended prior to such date in accordance with the 2022 Credit Agreement.\nThe Term Facility requires quarterly scheduled repayments of the term loans in each of the first, second, third and fourth years following the closing in\nannual amounts equal to 2.50%, 5.00%, 7.50% and 10.00% of the initial principal amount of the term loans, respectively. The term loans are also subject to\nmandatory prepayments from the proceeds of certain asset sales, subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds thereof.\nBorrowings under the 2022 Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus: (a) the applicable Term Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”) (which includes a SOFR adjustment of 0.10%), or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds\neffective rate plus 0.50%, (2) the Bank of America prime rate, (3) the Term SOFR rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.10%, and (4) 1.00%. The margin\nfor the 2022 Facility ranges, based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio, from 0.25% to 1.25% in the case of base rate loans and from 1.25% to 2.25% in the\ncase of Term SOFR rate loans. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Facility, we will pay (i) a commitment fee in respect of the\nunutilized commitments thereunder and (ii) customary letter of credit fees and agency fees. The commitment fees range from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum based on\nour consolidated net leverage ratio.\n28\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn.

The exercise price of stock options granted is equal to the closing price of the common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each\noption award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model (“Black-Scholes Model”). Expected volatility is based on\nhistorical volatility of our common stock. The expected term of options granted is based on analyses of historical employee termination rates and option exercises.\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant. The\ndividend yield assumption is based on the expectation of no future dividend payments. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Model were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nExpected volatility 40.35 - 40.46% 40.70 - 40.82% 40.01 - 40.46% 39.68 - 40.82%\nAverage expected term (in years) 4.8 4.9 5.0 4.8\nRisk-free interest rate 3.65 - 4.44% 4.19 - 4.29% 3.65 - 4.70% 3.37 - 4.29%\nExpected dividend yield — — — —\nIn February 2021, our Board of Directors approved our 2021 ESPP and our stockholders approved the plan in May 2021.

Share purchases are funded through payroll deduction of at least 1% and up to\n15% of an employee’s compensation for each payroll period, and no employee may purchase shares under the ESPP that exceeds $25,000 worth of our common\nstock for a calendar year.

Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Outstanding stock options, unvested RSUs, unvested PSUs, common shares expected to be issued\nunder our ESPP and the Convertible Notes are considered common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common\nshare when net income is reported and their effect is dilutive.\nPotentially dilutive common shares issuable upon vesting of stock options, RSUs and PSUs are determined using the average share price for each period\nunder the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive common shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are determined using the if-converted\nmethod. Since we have committed to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash upon conversion only, the number of shares for the conversion\nspread will be included as a dilutive common stock equivalent.\nA reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations is as follows (in thousands, except per\nshare amounts):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended September\nSeptember 30, 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator\nNet income $ 137,011 $ 81,837 $ 307,079 $ 196,206\nDenominator\nWeighted average common shares outstanding for basic earnings per share 126,850 131,965 126,969 132,896\nDilutive potential common stock outstanding\nStock options 2,174 1,830 1,844 1,882\nRSUs, PSUs and ESPP 817 288 615 378\nConvertible Notes 293 — 98 77\nWeighted average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share 130,134 134,083 129,526 135,233\nEarnings per share\nBasic $ 1.08 $ 0.62 $ 2.42 $ 1.48\nDiluted $ 1.05 $ 0.61 $ 2.37 $ 1.45\nShares which have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because their effect was anti-dilutive include the following\n(shares in millions):\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAnti-dilutive securities (1) 24.0 27.4 26.1 27.6\n(1) The anti-dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, unvested RSUs, unvested PSUs, common shares expected to be issued under our ESPP and\nConvertible Notes.\n33\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in disputes, including litigation, relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of our business.\nAny of these claims could subject us to costly legal expenses and, while we generally believe that we have adequate insurance to cover many different types of\nliabilities, our insurance carriers may deny coverage or our policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any damage awards or settlements. If this were to\nhappen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statements of income and balance sheets.\nAdditionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage our reputation and business. We currently are not a party to any legal proceedings, the\nadverse outcome of which, in our opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statements of\nincome or balance sheets.\n34\nItem 2.

We license our technology to biopharmaceutical companies to collaboratively develop products that combine ENHANZE with our\npartners’ proprietary compounds. We also develop, manufacture and commercialize, for ourselves or with our partners, drug-device combination products using\nour advanced auto-injector technologies that are designed to provide commercial or functional advantages such as improved convenience, reliability and\ntolerability, and enhanced patient comfort and adherence.\n35\nOur ENHANZE partners’ approved products and product candidates are based on rHuPH20, our patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme.\nrHuPH20 works by breaking down hyaluronan (“HA”), a naturally occurring carbohydrate that is a major component of the extracellular matrix of the SC space.\nThis temporarily reduces the barrier to bulk fluid flow allowing for improved and more rapid SC delivery of high dose, high volume injectable biologics, such as\nmonoclonal antibodies and other large therapeutic molecules, as well as small molecules and fluids. We refer to the application of rHuPH20 to facilitate the\ndelivery of other drugs or fluids as ENHANZE. We license our ENHANZE technology to form collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies that develop\nand/or market drugs requiring or benefiting from injection via the SC route of administration. In the development of proprietary intravenous (“IV”) drugs\ncombined with our ENHANZE technology, data have been generated supporting the potential for ENHANZE to reduce patient treatment burden, as a result of\nshorter duration of SC administration with ENHANZE compared to IV administration. ENHANZE may enable fixed-dose SC dosing compared to weight-based\ndosing typically required for IV administration, extend the dosing interval for drugs that are already administered subcutaneously and potentially allow for lower\nrates of infusion-related reactions. ENHANZE may enable more flexible treatment options such as home administration by a healthcare professional or potentially\nthe patient or caregiver. Lastly, certain proprietary drugs co-formulated with ENHANZE have been granted additional exclusivity, extending the patent life of the\nproduct beyond the patent expiry of the proprietary IV drug.\nWe currently have ENHANZE collaborations and licensing agreements with F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (“Roche”), Takeda\nPharmaceuticals International AG and Baxalta US Inc. (“Takeda”), Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”), Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), AbbVie, Inc. (“AbbVie”), Eli Lilly and\nCompany (“Lilly”), Bristol Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), argenx BVBA (“argenx”), ViiV Healthcare (the global specialist HIV Company majority owned by\nGlaxoSmithKline) (“ViiV”), Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Chugai”) and Acumen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Acumen”). In addition to receiving upfront\nlicensing fees from our ENHANZE collaborations, we are entitled to receive event and sales-based milestone payments, revenues from the sale of bulk rHuPH20\nand royalties from commercial sales of approved partner products co-formulated with ENHANZE. We currently earn royalties from the sales of eight commercial\nproducts including sales of one commercial product from each of the Takeda, Janssen and argenx collaborations and five commercial products from the Roche\ncollaboration.\nWe have commercialized auto-injector products with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (“Teva”) and Otter Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Otter”). We have\ndevelopment programs including auto-injectors with Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Idorsia”).\nOur commercial portfolio of proprietary products includes Hylenex®, utilizing rHuPH20, and our specialty product XYOSTED®, utilizing our auto-injector\ntechnology.\n36\nOur third quarter of 2024 and recent key events are as follows:\nPartners\n• In October 2024, argenx initiated two studies evaluating VYVGART Hytrulo with ENHANZE, a Phase 3 study for adult patients with ocular myasthenia\ngravis (“oMG”) and a Phase 2 study for kidney transplant recipients with antibody mediated rejection (“AMR”).\n• In October 2024, Janssen announced the European Commission (“EC”) approved DARZALEX SC for the treatment of patients newly diagnosed with\nmultiple myeloma (“NDMM”) who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (“ASCT”) in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and\ndexamethasone (“D-VRd”).\n• In September 2024, argenx expanded its global collaboration and license agreement nominating four additional targets that provides them exclusive\naccess to our ENHANZE drug delivery technology for a total of six targets.

Takeda launched HYQVIA in the first EU country in July 2013 and has continued to launch in additional countries. In\nMay 2016, Takeda announced that HYQVIA received a marketing authorization from the EC for a pediatric indication.\nIn September 2014, HYQVIA was approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with primary immunodeficiency in the U.S. HYQVIA is the first SC\nimmune globulin (“IG”) treatment approved for adult primary immunodeficiency patients with a dosing regimen requiring only one infusion up to once per month\n(every three to four weeks) and one injection site per infusion in most patients, to deliver a full therapeutic dose of IG.\nIn September 2020, Takeda announced the EMA approved a label update for HYQVIA broadening its use and making it the first and only facilitated SC\nimmunoglobulin replacement therapy in adults, adolescents and children with an expanded range of secondary immunodeficiencies (“SID”).\nIn October 2021, Takeda initiated a Phase 1 single-dose, single-center, open-label, three-arm study to assess the tolerability and safety of immune globulin\nSC (human), 20% solution with ENHANZE (TAK-881) at various infusion rates in healthy adult subjects. In October 2023, Takeda initiated a Phase 2/3 study to\nevaluate PK, safety, and tolerability of subcutaneous administration of TAK-881 in adult and pediatric participants with Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases\n(“PIDD”).\nIn July 2022, Takeda announced positive topline results from a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating HYQVIA, for maintenance treatment of CIDP. In June 2023,\nTakeda announced positive full results from a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating HYQVIA for maintenance treatment of CIDP and confirmed regulatory applications\nwere under review in the U.S. and EU for HYQVIA use as a maintenance therapy in adults with stable CIDP. In January 2024, Takeda received FDA and EC\napproval for HYQVIA for the treatment of CIDP.\n41\nIn April 2023, Takeda announced the FDA approved the sBLA to expand the use of HYQVIA to treat primary immunodeficiency in children. In February\n2024, Takeda submitted a NDA in Japan seeking approval for TAK-771, subcutaneous 10% human immunoglobulin with ENHANZE, for treatment of primary\nimmunodeficiency. In June 2024, Takeda announced Health Canada approved HYQVIA as replacement therapy for primary humoral immunodeficiency and\nsecondary humoral immunodeficiency in pediatric patients two years of age and older. In August 2024, Takeda submitted a NDA in Japan seeking approval for\nTAK-771 with ENHANZE for treatment of CIDP/MMN.\nPfizer Collaboration\nIn December 2012, we and Pfizer entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Pfizer has the worldwide license to develop and\ncommercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Pfizer proprietary biologics in primary care and specialty care indications. Pfizer currently has one\nnon-exclusive target.\nJanssen Collaboration\nIn December 2014, we and Janssen entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Janssen has the worldwide license to develop and\ncommercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Janssen proprietary biologics directed to up to five targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive\nbasis. Janssen elected CD38 and initiated several Phase 3 studies, Phase 2 studies and Phase 1 studies of DARZALEX® (daratumumab), directed at CD38, using\nENHANZE technology in patients with amyloidosis, smoldering myeloma and multiple myeloma.\nIn May 2020, Janssen launched the commercial sale of DARZALEX FASPRO® (DARZALEX utilizing ENHANZE technology) in four regimens across five\nindications in multiple myeloma patients, including newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible patients as well as relapsed or refractory patients. As a fixed-dose\nformulation, DARZALEX FASPRO can be administered over three to five minutes, significantly less time than DARZALEX IV which requires multi-hour\ninfusions. In June 2020, we announced that Janssen received European marketing authorization and launched the commercial sale of DARZALEX SC utilizing\nENHANZE in the EU. Subsequent to these approvals, Janssen received several additional regulatory approvals for additional indications and patient populations in\nthe U.S., EU, Japan and China. Beginning with the U.S., Janssen has marketing authorization for DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with bortezomib,\nthalidomide, and dexamethasone in NDMM patients who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant, in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and\ndexamethasone (“D-VCd”) for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis, in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (“D-\nPd”) for patients with multiple myeloma after first or subsequent relapse, and in combination with Kyprolis® (carfilzomib) and dexamethasone for patients with\nrelapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. In the EU, Janssen has marketing authorization for DARZALEX\nSC in combination with D-VCd in newly diagnosed adult patients with AL amyloidosis and in combination with D-Pd in adult patients with relapsed or refractory\nmultiple myeloma. In Japan, Janssen has marketing authorization for the SC formulation of DARZALEX (known as DARZQURO) for the treatment of multiple\nmyeloma and systemic AL amyloidosis. In China, Janssen has marketing authorization for DARZALEX SC for the treatment of primary light chain amyloidosis,\nin combination with D-VCd in newly diagnosed patients. In July 2024, Janssen announced the FDA approved DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with D-VRd\nfor induction and consolidation treatment and with lenalidomide (“D-R”) for maintenance treatment of adult patients who are NDMM and are eligible for\nautologous stem cell transplant (“ASCT”) with approval also received by the EC in October 2024. In September 2024, Janssen announced the submission of a\nsBLA to the FDA for approval of a new indication of DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with D-VRd for the treatment of adult patients with NDMM for\nwhom ASCT is deferred or who are ineligible for ASCT.\nIn December 2019, Janssen elected epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (“cMET”) as a bispecific\nantibody (amivantamab) target on an exclusive basis, which is being studied in solid tumors. In September 2022, following a Phase 1 study, Janssen initiated a\nPhase 3 study of lazertinib and amivantamab with ENHANZE in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (PALOMA-3). In\nNovember 2022, Janssen initiated a Phase 2 study of amivantamab with ENHANZE in multiple regimens in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors\nincluding EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (PALOMA-2). In May 2024, Janssen announced positive data from the Phase 3 PALOMA-3 study which\nsupported the submission of a marketing authorization application to the EMA for SC formulation of RYBREVANT (amivantamab) with ENHANZE for the\ntreatment of patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). In June 2024, Janssen announced the submission of a BLA to the FDA for\namivantamab SC co-formulated with ENHANZE also for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. The administration time for SC amivantamab was reduced to\napproximately five minutes from five hours for the first IV amivantamab infusion (across two days) and showed a five-fold reduction in infusion-related reactions.\nSC amivantamab also demonstrated longer overall survival, progression-free survival and duration of response. In August 2024, the FDA designated Janssen’s\nBLA priority review status for amivantamab SC in combination with LAZCLUZE for currently approved or submitted indication of IV in certain patients with\nNSCLC.\n42\nAbbVie Collaboration\nIn June 2015, we and AbbVie entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which AbbVie has the worldwide license to develop and\ncommercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with AbbVie proprietary biologics directed to up to nine targets.

We expect royalty revenue to further grow as a result of anticipated increasing partner product sales of\nDARZALEX SC and Phesgo, and sales of recently launched ENHANZE partner products, VYVGART Hytrulo, TECENTRIQ SC and OCREVUS SC. We expect\nmodest price erosion to continue on earlier launched ENHANZE partner products, Herceptin and MabThera.\nProduct Sales, Net – Product sales, net were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nProprietary product sales $ 39,925 $ 31,511 $ 8,414 27 %\nBulk rHuPH20 sales 31,493 37,001 (5,508) (15)%\nDevice partnered product sales 15,241 18,057 (2,816) (16)%\nTotal product sales, net $ 86,659 $ 86,569 $ 90 — %\nProduct sales, net were flat primarily due to contributions from our proprietary products, offset by lower sales of device partner products and bulk rHuPH20\ndriven by the timing of partner demand. We expect sales of our proprietary products will continue to grow in future years as we continue to gain market share in\nthe TRT market. We expect product sales of bulk rHuPH20 and device partnered products to fluctuate in future periods based on the needs of our partners.\nRevenues Under Collaborative Agreements – Revenues under collaborative agreements were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nUpfront license fees, license fees for the election of additional targets, event-\nbased payments, license maintenance fees and amortization of deferred\nupfront and other license fees:\nUpfront license and target nomination fees $ 27,000 $ — $ 27,000 100 %\nEvent-based development milestones and regulatory milestones and\nother fees 18,000 13,000 5,000 38 %\nDevice licensing and development revenue 3,364 2,031 1,333 66 %\nTotal revenues under collaborative agreements $ 48,364 $ 15,031 $ 33,333 222 %\nThe increase in revenues under collaborative agreements was primarily due to the timing of milestones achieved. Revenue from upfront licenses fees, license\nfees for the election of additional targets, license maintenance fees and other license fees and event-based payments vary from period to period based on our\nENHANZE collaboration activity. We expect these revenues to continue to fluctuate in future periods based on our partners’ ability to meet various clinical and\nregulatory milestones set forth in such agreements and our ability to obtain new collaborative agreements.\n46\nOperating expenses – Operating expenses were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nCost of sales $ 49,426 $ 54,823 $ (5,397) (10)%\nAmortization of intangibles 17,762 20,341 (2,579) (13)%\nResearch and development 18,458 17,321 1,137 7 %\nSelling, general and administrative 41,241 35,269 5,972 17 %\nCost of Sales – Cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs, fill and finish costs, freight costs, internal costs and\nmanufacturing overhead associated with the production of our proprietary products, device partnered products and bulk rHuPH20. The decrease in cost of sales\nwas primarily due to lower device and bulk rHuPH20 sales.\nAmortization of intangibles – Amortization of intangibles consists primarily of expense associated with the amortization of acquired device technologies and\nproduct rights. The decrease in amortization of intangibles expense was primarily due to an impairment charge of $2.5 million recognized in the prior year to fully\nimpair the TLANDO product rights intangible asset.\nResearch and Development – Research and development expenses consist of external costs, salaries and benefits and allocation of facilities and other\noverhead expenses related to research manufacturing, preclinical and regulatory activities related to our collaborations, and our development platforms. The\nmodest increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased compensation expense.\nSelling, General and Administrative – Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in\nexecutive, selling and administrative functions as well as professional fees for legal and accounting, business development, commercial operations support for\nproprietary products and alliance management and marketing support for our collaborations. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to increased\ncompensation expense and consulting and professional service fees.\nInvestment and other income, net – investment and other income, net was as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nInvestment and other income, net $ 6,474 $ 4,786 $ 1,688 35 %\nInvestment and other income, net consists primarily of interest income on our cash, cash-equivalent and marketable securities. The increase in investment\nand other income, net was primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance.\nInterest Expense – Interest expense was as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nInterest expense $ 4,524 $ 4,505 $ 19 — %\nInterest expense consists primarily of costs related to our convertible notes and revolving credit facility.

Our annual effective\ntax rate is estimated to be approximately 19% for 2024, which differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a decrease from a share-based\ncompensation windfall tax benefit, FDII deduction, and research and development credit generation, partially offset by state income tax and Section 162(m)\ndisallowance.\n47\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRoyalties – Royalties were as follows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nRoyalties $ 400,572 $ 325,813 $ 74,759 23 %\nThe increase in royalties was primarily driven by continued sales uptake of DARZALEX SC by Janssen and Phesgo by Roche in all geographies, and the\nprior year launch of Vyvgart Hytrulo by argenx.\nProduct Sales, Net – Product sales, net were as follows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nSales of proprietary products $ 119,319 $ 91,765 $ 27,554 30 %\nSales of bulk rHuPH20 66,637 86,203 (19,566) (23)%\nSales of device partnered product 38,172 43,284 (5,112) (12)%\nTotal product sales, net $ 224,128 $ 221,252 $ 2,876 1 %\nThe increase in product sales, net was primarily due to contributions from our proprietary products, partially offset by lower sales of bulk rHuPH20 and\ndevice partnered products driven by the timing of partner demand.\nRevenues Under Collaborative Agreements – Revenues under collaborative agreements were as follows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nUpfront license fees, license fees for the election of additional targets,\nevent-based payments, license maintenance fees and amortization of\ndeferred upfront and other license fees:\nUpfront license and target nomination fees $ 27,000 $ — $ 27,000 100 %\nEvent-based development milestones and regulatory milestones\nand other fees 57,500 46,000 11,500 25 %\nDevice licensing and development revenue 8,116 6,149 1,967 32 %\nTotal revenues under collaborative agreements $ 92,616 $ 52,149 $ 40,467 78 %\nThe increase in revenues under collaborative agreements was primarily due to the timing of milestones achieved.\nOperating expenses - Operating expenses were as follows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nCost of sales $ 117,362 $ 140,063 $ (22,701) (16)%\nAmortization of intangibles 53,287 56,011 (2,724) (5)%\nResearch and development 58,607 55,027 3,580 7 %\nSelling, general and administrative 112,086 111,574 512 — %\nCost of Sales – The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to lower bulk rHuPH20 and device sales, partially offset by higher proprietary product sales.\nAmortization of intangibles – The decrease in amortization of intangibles expense was primarily due to an impairment charge of $2.5 million recognized in\nthe prior year to fully impair the TLANDO product rights intangible asset.\nResearch and Development – The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to planned investments in ENHANZE related to the\ndevelopment of our new high-yield rHuPH20 manufacturing processes.\nSelling, General and Administrative – The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to increased compensation expense and consulting and professional\nservice fees, partially offset by planned reductions in commercial marketing expense.\n48\nInvestment and other income, net - Investment and other income, net was as follows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nInvestment and other income, net $ 16,499 $ 10,957 $ 5,542 51 %\nThe increase in investment and other income, net was primarily due to an increase in the average invested balance.\nInterest Expense – Interest expense was as follows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nInterest expense $ 13,555 $ 13,542 $ 13 — %\nInterest expense was flat year over year.\nIncome Tax Expense – Income tax expense was as follows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase / (Decrease)\n2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nIncome tax expense $ 71,839 $ 50,948 $ 20,891 41 %\nThe increase in income tax expense was primarily due to higher income before income tax expense, partially offset by an increase in tax benefits mainly\nrelated to with a share-based compensation windfall and a FDII deduction recognized during the current period.\n49\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $666.3 million. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient\nto fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. We expect to fund our operations going forward with existing cash resources, anticipated revenues from\nour existing collaborative agreements and cash that we may raise through future transactions. We may raise cash through any one of the following financing\nvehicles: (i) new collaborative agreements; (ii) expansions or revisions to existing collaborative relationships; (iii) private financings; (iv) other equity or debt\nfinancings; (v) monetizing assets; and/or (vi) the public offering of securities.\nWe may, in the future, draw on our existing line of credit or offer and sell additional equity, debt securities and warrants to purchase any of such securities,\neither individually or in units to raise capital for additional working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions or for other general corporate\npurposes.\nCash Flows\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Change\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 300,597 $ 286,217 $ 14,380\nNet cash used in investing activities (292,203) (88,618) (203,585)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 27,554 (158,067) 185,621\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 35,948 $ 39,532 $ (3,584)\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by operations was primarily due to an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher working capital spend.\nInvesting Activities\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease\nin capital spend for property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repurchase of $150.1 million in common stock in the prior year and $13.5\nmillion in cash paid on the conversion of our 2024 Convertible Notes in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of common\nstock under our equity incentive plan.\nShare Repurchases\nIn December 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our outstanding common stock which\nwe completed in June 2024. In February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new capital return program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our\noutstanding common stock. Refer to Note 9, Stockholders’ Equity, of our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our\nshare repurchases.\n50\nLong-Term Debt\n1.00% Convertible Notes due 2028\nIn August 2022, we completed the sale of $720.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Convertible\nNotes”). The net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers’ fee of $18.0 million, was\napproximately $702.0 million. We also incurred additional debt issuance costs totaling $1.0 million. Debt issuance costs and the initial purchasers’ fee are\npresented as a debt discount.\nThe 2028 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears on February 15th and August 15th of each year at an annual rate of 1.00%. The 2028\nConvertible Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to\nthe 2028 Convertible Notes, rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, are effectively junior to any\nsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities\n(including trade payables) of our current or future subsidiaries. The 2028 Convertible Notes have a maturity date of August 15, 2028.\nHolders may convert their 2028 Convertible Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the\ncalendar quarter ending on December 31, 2022, if the last reported sale price per share of common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least\n20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the\nfive consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in\nwhich the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported\nsale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or\ndistributions on our common stock, as described in the offering memorandum for the 2028 Convertible Notes; (4) if we call such notes for redemption; and (5) at\nany time from, and including, February 15, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the 2028 Convertible Notes were not convertible.\nUpon conversion, we will pay cash for the settlement of principal, and for the premium, if applicable, we will pay cash, deliver shares of common stock or a\ncombination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate for the 2028 Convertible Notes is 17.8517 shares of common stock\nper $1,000 in principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $56.02 per share of our common stock. The\nconversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued or unpaid interest.\nCapped Call Transactions\nIn connection with the offering of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the “Capped Call\nTransactions”). The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon conversion of the 2028\nConvertible Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of such\nconverted 2028 Convertible Notes. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is initially $75.4075 per share of common stock, representing a premium of 75%\nabove the last reported sale price of $43.09 per share of common stock on August 15, 2022, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped\nCall Transactions. As of September 30, 2024, no capped calls had been exercised.\nPursuant to their terms, the capped calls qualify for classification within stockholders’ equity in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, and their fair\nvalue is not remeasured and adjusted as long as they continue to qualify for stockholders’ equity classification. We paid approximately $69.1 million for the\nCapped Calls, including applicable transaction costs, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions entered into by us with the capped call Counterparties, are not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes,\nand do not affect any holder’s rights under the Convertible Notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes do not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call\nTransactions.\n0.25% Convertible Notes due 2027\nIn March 2021, we completed the sale of $805.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Convertible\nNotes”). The net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2027 Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers’ fee of $20.1 million, was\napproximately $784.9 million. We also incurred additional debt issuance costs totaling $0.4 million. Debt issuance costs and the initial purchasers’ fee are\npresented as a debt discount.\n51\nThe 2027 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears on March 1st and September 1st of each year at an annual rate of 0.25%. The 2027\nConvertible Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to\nthe 2027 Convertible Notes, will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, are effectively junior to any\nsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities\n(including trade payables) of our current or future subsidiaries. The 2027 Convertible Notes have a maturity date of March 1, 2027.\nHolders may convert their 2027 Convertible Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the\ncalendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021, if the last reported sale price per share of common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20\ntrading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the\nfive consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in\nwhich the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported\nsale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or\ndistributions on our common stock, as described in the offering memorandum for the 2027 Convertible Notes; (4) if we call such notes for redemption; and (5) at\nany time from, and including, September 1, 2026 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the 2027 Convertible Notes were not convertible.\nUpon conversion, we will pay cash for the settlement of principal, and for the premium, if applicable, we will pay cash, deliver shares of common stock or a\ncombination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate for the 2027 Convertible Notes is 12.9576 shares of common stock\nper $1,000 in principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $77.17 per share of our common stock. The\nconversion rate is subject to adjustment.\n1.25% Convertible Notes due 2024\nIn November 2019, we completed the sale of $460.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024\nConvertible Notes”). The net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers’ fee of $12.7 million,\nwas approximately $447.3 million. We also incurred debt issuance cost totaling $0.3 million. Debt issuance costs and the initial purchasers’ fee were presented as a\ndebt discount.\nIn January 2021, we notified the note holders of our irrevocable election to settle the principal of the 2024 Convertible Notes in cash and for the premium, to\ndeliver shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the 2024 Convertible Notes was 41.9208 shares of common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2024\nConvertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $23.85 per share of our common stock. The conversion rate was subject to adjustment.\nIn January 2023, we issued a notice for the redemption of 2024 Convertible Notes. Holders of the notes could convert their notes at any time prior to the\nclose of the business day prior to the redemption date. In March 2023, holders of the notes elected to convert the 2024 Convertible Notes in full. In connection\nwith the conversion, we paid approximately $13.5 million in cash which included principal and accrued interest, and issued 288,886 shares of our common stock\nrepresenting the intrinsic value based on the contractual conversion rate.\nRevolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities\nIn May 2022, we entered into a credit agreement, which was subsequently amended in August 2022 (the “Amendment”), with Bank of America, N.A., as\nAdministrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and an L/C Issuer, and the other lenders and L/C Issuers party thereto (the “2022 Credit Agreement”), evidencing a\ncredit facility (the “2022 Facility”) that provides for (i) a $575 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and (ii) a $250 million term loan\nfacility (the “Term Facility”). Concurrently, with the entry into the Amendment, we repaid the entire outstanding Term Loan Facility and repaid all outstanding\nloans under the Revolving Credit Facility under the 2022 Credit Agreement. The 2022 Facility will mature on November 30, 2026 unless either the Revolving\nCredit Facility or the Term Facility is extended prior to such date in accordance with the 2022 Credit Agreement.\nThe Term Facility requires quarterly scheduled repayments of the term loans in each of the first, second, third and fourth years following the closing in\nannual amounts equal to 2.50%, 5.00%, 7.50% and 10.00% of the initial principal amount of the term loans, respectively. The term loans are also subject to\nmandatory prepayments from the proceeds of certain asset sales, subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds thereof.\n52\nBorrowings under the 2022 Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus: (a) the applicable Term Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”) (which includes a SOFR adjustment of 0.10%), or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds\neffective rate plus 0.50%, (2) the Bank of America prime rate, (3) the Term SOFR rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.10%, and (4) 1.00%. The margin\nfor the 2022 Facility ranges, based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio, from 0.25% to 1.25% in the case of base rate loans and from 1.25% to 2.25% in the\ncase of Term SOFR rate loans. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the 2022 Facility, we will pay (i) a commitment fee in respect of\nthe unutilized commitments thereunder and (ii) customary letter of credit fees and agency fees. The commitment fees range from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum based\non our consolidated net leverage ratio.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the revolving credit facility was undrawn.\nAdditional Capital Requirements\nOur expected working capital and other capital requirements are described in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material\nchanges to our expected working capital and other capital requirements described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have\nbeen prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The accounting policies and estimates that are most critical to a\nfull understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results are described in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no material changes to our critical accounting\npolicies or estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting\npronouncements and their effect, if any.\n53\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere have been no material changes in our market risks during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of investments in money market funds, asset-backed securities, U.S.\nTreasury securities, corporate debt securities, agency bonds and commercial paper. These investments were made in accordance with our investment policy which\nspecifies the categories, allocations, and ratings of securities we may consider for investment. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve\nprincipal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk. Some of the financial instruments that we invest in could\nbe subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the instruments to fluctuate. For example, if we purchase a\nsecurity that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of that security may decline. Based on our current investment\nportfolio as of September 30, 2024, we do not believe that our results of operations would be materially impacted by an immediate change of 10% in interest rates.\nWe hedge a portion of foreign currency exchange risk associated with forecasted royalties revenue denominated in Swiss francs to reduce the risk of our\nearnings and cash flows being adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. These transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The cash\nflow hedges are carried at fair value with mark-to-market gains and losses recorded within AOCI in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and reclassified to\nroyalty revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of income in the same period as the recognition of the underlying hedged transaction. We do not issue\nderivatives, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nFurther, we do not believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities have significant risk of default or illiquidity. We made this determination\nbased on discussions with our investment advisors and a review of our holdings. While we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities do not\ncontain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. All of our\ncash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair market value.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow\ntimely decision regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a\nreasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and\nprocedures.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted\nan evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n54\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in disputes, including litigation, relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of our business. Any\nof these claims could subject us to costly legal expenses and, while we generally believe that we have adequate insurance to cover many different types of\nliabilities, our insurance carriers may deny coverage or our policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any damage awards or settlements. If this were to\nhappen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statements of income and balance sheets.\nAdditionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage our reputation and business. We currently are not a party to any legal proceedings, the\nadverse outcome of which, in our opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statements of\nincome or balance sheets.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nIn December 2021, the Board of Directors authorized a capital return program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of outstanding stock over a three-year\nperiod which we completed in June 2024.\nIn February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new capital return program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our outstanding common stock.\nThere were no share repurchases made during the third quarter of 2024.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the following director and officer each adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are\ndefined pursuant to Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K) as noted in the table below.\nTrading Arrangement\nNon-Rule 10b5- Total Shares To Be\nName and Title Action Date Rule 10b5-1* 1** Sold Expiration Date\nJeffrey W.
