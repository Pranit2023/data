Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nNovember 4, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/11656/pdf)\n\n**Authorizes Share Repurchase Program**\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. (“Tactile Medical”; the “Company”) (Nasdaq: TCMD), a medical technology company providing therapies for people with chronic disorders, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and announced the adoption of a share repurchase program.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Summary & Recent Business Highlights:**\n\n  * Total revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $73.1 million\n    * Lymphedema product revenue increased 4% over Q3 2023\n    * Airway clearance product revenue increased 10% over Q3 2023\n  * Net income of $5.2 million versus $22.3 million in Q3 2023\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 million versus $7.7 million in Q3 2023\n  * Operating cashflow of $24.3 million year-to-date, compared to $17.5 million in the prior year period\n  * Ended Q3 2024 with $82.1 million in cash and cash equivalents\n  * Launched Nimbl, our next-generation lymphedema therapy platform for upper extremity conditions\n  * Announced publication of positive clinical trial results in VA lymphedema patients using Flexitouch therapy\n  * Authorized a program to repurchase up to $30.0 million of the Company’s common stock\n\n\n\n“In the third quarter, we delivered solid gross margin expansion, drove continued improvements in profitability, and achieved double-digit growth in both our commercial and VA lymphedema channels,” said Sheri Dodd, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tactile Medical. “Operationally, we advanced key pillars of our commercial strategy, including launching our next-generation lymphedema therapy platform and announcing the publication of a positive new data set among Veterans.”\n\nMs. Dodd continued, “While pleased with this performance, our revenue was impacted by changes in policy interpretation from Medicare administrators and DME buying patterns within our airway clearance business. However, we continue to see strong patient and clinician demand for our products, aided by improving CMS coverage conditions on the near horizon. We are taking a concerted approach to fortify our sales channels, simplify our front and back-office work through technology modernization, and amplify the voice of our patients and providers through product and service innovation.”\n\nMs. Dodd concluded, “Finally, we are increasingly benefiting from generating free cash flow, a trend we expect to continue. This provides us the luxury of continuing to evaluate various investment opportunities to drive growth and increase shareholder value, while also initiating a share repurchase program. We believe this strategic near-term use of cash aligns with our conviction in the trajectory of our business and our ability to execute our financial and operational initiatives.”\n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nThe Company also announced today that the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a program to repurchase up to $30.0 million of common stock. Under the program, purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated purchases, or both. The timing and number of shares to be purchased will be based on the price of the Company's common stock, general business and market conditions and other investment considerations and factors. The share repurchase program expires on October 31, 2026. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program with cash on hand.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenue in the third quarter of 2024 increased $3.5 million, or 5%, to $73.1 million, compared to $69.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in total revenue was attributable to an increase of $2.8 million, or 4%, in sales and rentals of the lymphedema product line and an increase of $0.7 million, or 10%, in sales of the airway clearance product line in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit in the third quarter of 2024 increased $5.4 million, or 11%, to $54.8 million, compared to $49.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin was 75.0% of revenue, compared to 70.9% of revenue in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin was 75.4% of revenue, compared to 71.4% of revenue in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 increased $6.6 million, or 16%, to $48.0 million, compared to $41.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating income was $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $8.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2024 was $7.9 million, compared to $5.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOther income was $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to other expense of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIncome tax expense was $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to an income tax benefit of $14.7 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet income in the third quarter of 2024 was $5.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to $22.3 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2024 was $6.0 million, compared to $20.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change in both net income and non-GAAP net income was driven by the impact last year’s valuation allowance release had on prior-year income tax.\n\nWeighted average shares used to compute diluted net income per share were 24.3 million and 23.8 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $7.7 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**First Nine Months 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased $10.6 million, or 5%, to $207.4 million, compared to $196.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in total revenue was attributable to an increase of $10.0 million, or 6%, in sales and rentals of the lymphedema product line and an increase of $0.6 million, or 2%, in sales of the airway clearance product line for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $7.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to $20.3 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Non-GAAP net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $9.5 million, compared to $20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nWeighted average shares used to compute diluted net income per share were 24.1 million and 23.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $20.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $14.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Balance Sheet Summary**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $82.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $27.0 million of outstanding borrowings under its credit agreement, compared to $61.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $29.3 million of outstanding borrowings under its credit agreement as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nThe Company is updating its 2024 financial outlook and now expects full year 2024 total revenue in the range of $292 million to $295 million, representing growth of approximately 6% to 8% year-over-year, compared to total revenue of $274.4 million in 2023. The Company’s prior 2024 guidance expectation was total revenue in the range of $293 million to $298 million, representing growth of approximately 7% to 9%.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host a conference call with a question-and-answer session at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 4, 2024, to discuss the results of the quarter.

Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by the use of words like “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” “continue,” “confident,” “outlook,” “guidance,” “project,” “goals,” “look forward,” “poised,” “designed,” “plan,” “return,” “focused,” “prospects” or “remain” or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. The reader is cautioned not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, as these statements are subject to numerous factors and uncertainties outside of the Company’s control that can make such statements untrue, including, but not limited to, the Company’s ability to obtain reimbursement from third-party payers for its products; the impacts of inflation, rising interest rates or a recession; the adequacy of the Company’s liquidity to pursue its business objectives; adverse economic conditions or intense competition; price increases for supplies and components; wage and component price inflation; loss of a key supplier; entry of new competitors and products; compliance with and changes in federal, state and local government regulation; loss or retirement of key executives, including transition matters related to the Company’s recent Chief Executive Officer change; technological obsolescence of the Company’s products; technical problems with the Company’s research and products; the Company’s ability to expand its business through strategic acquisitions; the Company’s ability to integrate acquisitions and related businesses; the effects of current and future U.S. and foreign trade policy and tariff actions; or the inability to carry out research, development and commercialization plans. In addition, other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company’s filings with the SEC. Investors and security holders are urged to read these documents free of charge on the SEC’s website at <http://www.sec.gov>. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income, which differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in this release represents net income or loss, plus interest expense, net, or less interest income, net, less income tax benefit or plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, plus stock-based compensation expense, plus or minus the change in fair value of earn-out and plus executive transition costs. Non-GAAP gross profit in this release represents gross profit plus non-cash intangible asset amortization expense. Non-GAAP gross margin in this release represents non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP operating income in this release represents operating income adjusted for non-cash intangible asset amortization expense, change in fair value of earn-out and executive transition expenses. Non-GAAP net income represents net income adjusted for non-cash intangible asset amortization expense, change in fair value of earn-out and executive transition expenses, and adjusted for the income tax effect on reconciling items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this press release.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented because the Company believes they are useful indicators of its operating performance. Management uses these measures principally as measures of the Company’s operating performance and for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s annual operating plan and financial projections. The Company believes these measures are useful to investors as supplemental information and because they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in its industry. The Company also believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to its management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used as a performance metric in the Company’s compensation program.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as an alternative to, or superior to, their respective GAAP financial measures, as measures of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be construed to imply that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company’s presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on the Company’s GAAP results in addition to using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis. The Company’s definition of these non-GAAP financial measures is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\n\n**Tactile
