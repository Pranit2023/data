          "content": "SCHMID Group N.V. Related Party Transactions Policy\nA. Introduction\nThe board of directors (the “Board”) of SCHMID Group N.V. (the “Company”) recognizes that certain\ntransactions present a heightened risk of conflicts of interest or the perception thereof. The Board has\ndetermined that the Audit Committee is best suited to review and approve all Interested Transactions\nwith Related Parties, as those terms are defined in this Related Party Transactions Policy (this “Policy”).\nTherefore, the Audit Committee has adopted this Policy to ensure that all Interested Transactions with\nRelated Parties shall be subject to approval or ratification in accordance with the procedures set forth\nbelow.\nB. Effective Date\nThis Policy is effective immediately.\nC. Definitions\nInterested Transaction: is any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions,\narrangements or relationships (including the incurrence or issuance of any indebtedness or the guarantee\nof indebtedness) in which (i) the aggregate amount involved will or may be reasonably expected to\nexceed €120,000 in any calendar year, (ii) the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, and\n(iii) any Related Party has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than solely as a result of being\na director, officer or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity).\nRelated Party: (i) A Director, or nominee for election as Director, Officer of the Company or a 5% or\ngreater Shareholder (as further set out in the applicable accounting standards used for the Company's\nSEC filings), or (ii) an immediate family member (e.g. spouse, parents, children or siblings) of any\nparty mentioned in (i) of this definition.\nD. Notification of Interested Transactions\nEach Director, nominee for election as Director, or Officer shall promptly notify the Legal Affairs\ndepartment of the SCHMID group of any material interest that such person or an Immediate Family\nMember of such person had, has or may have in an Interested Transaction. The notice shall include a\ndescription of the transaction, all material information and the aggregate dollar amount.\nE. Review of Interested Transactions\nThe Legal Affairs department of the SCHMID group will undertake an evaluation of the Interested\nTransaction. If that evaluation indicates that the Interested Transaction would require the Audit\nCommittee’s approval, the Legal Affairs department of the SCHMID group will report the Interested\nTransaction, together with a summary of material facts, to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee\nshall review the material facts of all Interested Transactions that require the Audit Committee’s approval\nand either approve or disapprove of the entry into the Interested Transaction, subject to the exceptions\ndescribed below.\nIf advance Audit Committee approval of an Interested Transaction is not feasible (e.g. in the event the\ntransaction is urgent and in the best interest of the SCHMID group), then the Interested Transaction\nshall be considered and, if the Audit Committee determines it to be appropriate, ratified at the Audit\nCommittee’s next regularly scheduled meeting.\nIn determining whether to approve or ratify an Interested Transaction, the Audit Committee will take\ninto account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the Interested Transaction is on terms\n1\nno less favourable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar\ncircumstances and the extent of the Related Person’s interest in the transaction.\nAn Interested Transaction reviewed under this Policy will be considered approved or ratified if it is\nauthorized by the Audit Committee, as applicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in this\nPolicy after full disclosure of the Related Party’s interests in the transaction. As appropriate for the\ncircumstances, the Audit Committee shall review and consider:\n• the Related Party’s interest in the Interested Transaction;\n• the approximate value of the amount involved in the Interested Transaction;\n• the approximate value of the amount of the Related Party’s interest in the transaction without\nregard to the amount of any profit or loss;\n• whether the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of business of the Company;\n• whether the transaction with the Related Party is proposed to be, or was, entered into on terms\nno less favourable to the Company than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated\nthird party;\n• the purpose of, and the potential benefits to the Company of, the Interested Transaction;\n• whether the Interested Transaction would impair the independence of an outside director;\n• required public disclosure, if any; and\n• any other information regarding the Interested Transaction or the Related Party in the context\nof the proposed transaction that would be material to investors in light of the circumstances of\nthe particular transaction.\nThe Audit Committee will review all relevant information available to it about the Interested\nTransaction. The Audit Committee may approve or ratify the Interested Transaction only if the Audit\nCommittee determines in good faith that, under all of the circumstances, the transaction is fair as to the\nCompany. The Audit Committee, in its sole discretion, may impose such conditions as it deems\nappropriate on the Company or the Related Party in connection with approval of the Interested\nTransaction.\nF. Audit Committee Conflicts of Interest\nNo Director shall participate in any discussion or approval of an Interested Transaction for which he or\nshe is a Related Party, except that the director shall provide all material information concerning the\nInterested Transaction to the Audit Committee.\nIf an Interested Transaction will be ongoing, the Audit Committee may establish guidelines for the\nCompany’s management to follow in its ongoing dealings with the Related Party. Thereafter, the Audit\nCommittee, on at least an annual basis, shall review and assess ongoing relationships with the Related\nParty to ensure that they are in compliance with the Audit Committee’s guidelines and that the Interested\nTransaction remains appropriate.\nAdditionally, in the event that an Interested Transaction involving a Director may constitute an actual\nor potential Director conflict of interest, the Legal Affairs department of the SCHMID group shall notify\nthe chairperson of the Nominating Committee of such Interested Transaction.\nG. Pre-Approved Interested Transactions\nThe Interested Transactions described below shall be deemed to be pre-approved by the Audit\nCommittee and no further approval is required, even if the aggregate amount involved will exceed\n€120,000:\n2\ni. Employment of executive officers. Any employment by the Company of an executive officer\nof the Company or any of its subsidiaries if the related compensation is approved (or\nrecommended to the Board for approval) by the Compensation Committee;\nii. Director compensation. Any compensation paid to a Director if the compensation is consistent\nwith the Company’s compensation policy and is required to be publicly disclosed;\niii.

(the \"Company\" and together with its subsidiaries \"SCHMID\") and\nthe federal securities laws for any officer, director or employee of SCHMID to (a) trade in securities of\nthe Company while aware of \"material non-public information\" concerning SCHMID or (b)\ncommunicate, \"tip\" or disclose material non-public information concerning SCHMID to outsiders so\nthat they may trade in securities of the Company based on that information. To prevent even the\nappearance of improper insider trading or tipping, SCHMID has adopted this Insider Trading Conduct\nPolicy (\"Policy\") for all of its directors, officers and employees and their family members, as well as\nfor others who have access to information through business relationships with SCHMID.\nSCHMID may maintain a separate insider trading policy to be published and provided to vendors,\nsuppliers, partners or other third parties, or it may directly reference such third parties in the general\ninsider trading policy.\nThe consequences of prohibited insider trading or tipping can be severe.

SCOPE\nA. Covered Persons\nThis Policy covers all directors, officers and employees of SCHMID and their respective immediate\nfamily members and any person (whether or not related) sharing the same household as well as any\noutsiders whom SCHMID may designate as Insiders because they have access to material non-public\ninformation concerning SCHMID (\"Insiders\").\nB. Covered Transactions\nThe Policy applies to any and all transactions in the Company's securities. For purposes of the Policy,\nthe Company's securities include its common stock, options to purchase or sell common stock and any\nother type of securities that the Company may issue, such as preferred stock, convertible debentures,\nwarrants and exchange-traded options or other derivative securities and short sales (collectively,\n\"Company Securities\"). Transactions in Company Securities include not only market transactions, but\nalso private sales of Company Securities, pledges of Company Securities to secure a loan or margin\naccount, as well as charitable donations of Company Securities.\n1\nC. Policy Delivery\nThe Policy will be delivered to all directors, officers and employees and other designated persons at the\nstart of their relationship with SCHMID. Upon first receiving a copy of the Policy or any revised\nversions, each recipient must sign an acknowledgment that he or she has received a copy of the Policy\nand agrees to comply with the Policy's terms. The receipt of this Policy as well as the acknowledgement\ncan also take place in a digital form.\nIII. DEFINITION OF \"MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION\"\nA. \"Material\" Information\n\"Material Information\" is any information about SCHMID that a reasonable investor would consider\nimportant in making an investment decision to buy or sell Company Securities. If an investor would\nwant to buy or sell securities based in part on the information, the information should be considered\nmaterial. In simple terms, material information is any type of information that could reasonably be\nexpected to affect the price of Company Securities. While it is not possible to identify all information\nthat would be deemed \"material,\" the following types of information ordinarily would be considered\nmaterial:\n• Financial performance, especially quarterly and year-end earnings;\n• Significant changes in financial performance outlook or liquidity of SCHMID as a whole or of\na reporting segment of SCHMID's business;\n• SCHMID projections that significantly differ from external expectations;\n• Potential mergers and acquisitions or the sale of significant SCHMID assets or subsidiaries;\n• New major contracts, orders, suppliers, customers or finance sources, or the loss thereof;\n• Major discoveries or significant changes or developments in products or product lines, research\nor technologies;\n• Approvals or denials of requests for regulatory approval by government agencies of products,\npatents or trademarks;\n• Significant changes or developments in supplies or inventory, including significant product\ndefects, recalls or product returns;\n• Significant pricing changes;\n• Stock splits, public or private securities/debt offerings or changes in Company dividend policies\nor amounts;\n• Significant changes in management;\n• Significant labor disputes or negotiations, including possible strikes;\n• Actual or potential exposure to major litigation, or the resolution of such litigation;\n• Possible proxy contests;\n2\n• Imminent or potential changes in the SCHMID's credit rating by a rating agency;\n• Voluntary calls of debt or preferred stock of the Company;\n• The contents of forthcoming publications that may affect the market price of Company\nSecurities;\n• Statements by stock market analysts regarding SCHMID and/or its securities;\n• Significant changes in sales volumes, market share, production scheduling, product pricing or\nmix of sales;\n• Analyst upgrades or downgrades of a Company Security;\n• Significant changes in accounting treatment, write-offs or effective tax rate;\n• Impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems of SCHMID or one of its subsidiaries or\nsignificant business partners;\n• Gain or loss of a substantial customer or supplier; or\n• A significant cybersecurity incident experienced by SCHMID that has not yet been made public.\nB. \"Non-public\" Information\nInformation is considered \"non-public\" until it has been widely disseminated to the public through SEC\nfilings, major newswire services, national news services and financial news services and there has been\nsufficient time for the market to digest that information. For the purposes of this Policy, information\nwill be considered public after the close of trading on the second full trading day after the Company's\nwidespread public release of the information. Thus, no transaction should take place until the second\ntrading day after the disclosure of the material information.\nIV. STATEMENT OF COMPANY POLICY AND PROCEDURES\nA. Prohibited Activities\nNo Insider may trade in Company Securities while aware of material non-public information concerning\nSCHMID.\nNo Insider may trade in Company Securities during any special trading blackout periods as designated\nby the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID or CFO. The deviation of any blackout period as well as\nthose Insiders subject to the blackout shall be determined by the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID\nor CFO. Moreover, the Insider will not disclose to any person the applicability of a special blackout\nperiod without prior permission of the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID or CFO.\nNo Insider may trade in Company Securities outside of the applicable \"trading windows\" described\nbelow.\nNo Insider may \"tip\" or disclose material non-public information concerning the Company to any\nperson, including family members or colleagues, even if that person is expected to hold such \"tip\" in\nconfidence, unless required as part of that Insider's regular duties for SCHMID or authorized by the\nLegal Affairs department of SCHMID or CFO. In the case of inadvertent disclosure to an outside person,\nthe Insider must advise the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID or CFO as soon as the inadvertent\ndisclosure has been discovered. To protect against inadvertent disclosures, all inquiries from outsiders\n3\nregarding material non-public information about SCHMID must be forwarded to the Legal Affairs\ndepartment of SCHMID or CFO.\nNo Insider may give trading advice of any kind about SCHMID to anyone, whether or not such Insider\nis aware of material non-public information about SCHMID.\nNo Insider may trade in any interest or position relating to the future price of Company Securities, such\nas a put, call or short sale.\nWithout the specific prior approval of the Legal Affairs department, the CEO or the audit committee of\nthe Board (the \"Audit Committee\"), no Insider shall accept outside employment, as a consultant,\nindependent contractor or employee, where the Insider is being compensated for the Insider's knowledge\nof SCHMID or the industry or potential products of SCHMID.\nWithout the specific prior approval of the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID, the CEO or the Audit\nCommittee, no Insider shall respond to market rumors or otherwise make any public statements\nregarding SCHMID or its prospects. This includes responding to or commenting on Internet-based\nbulletin boards or social media platforms. If you become aware of any rumors or false statements, you\nshould report them to the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID or CFO.\nB. Trading Windows and Blackout Periods\nProvided that no other restrictions on trading in Company Securities apply, Insiders may trade in\nCompany Securities during and only during the period beginning at the close of trading three full trading\ndays following the Company's widespread public release of quarterly or year-end earnings and ending\non the last trading day of the second month following the end of the preceding quarter.\nNotwithstanding the above provisions, any Insider who is aware of material non-public information\nconcerning SCHMID may not trade in Company Securities even during a trading window until two\ntrading days after such material non-public information has been subject to the Company's widespread\npublic release of the information.\nNo Insiders identified by the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID or CFO as being subject to a special\nblackout period (the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID and/or the CFO may, in their sole discretion,\nmaintain a list of such Insiders) may trade in Company Securities during such special blackout period.\nThe Legal Affairs department or CFO may, following consultation with the CEO, declare such special\nblackout periods from time-to-time as conditions warrant. No Insider, whether or not subject to a special\nblackout period, may disclose to any outside third party that a special blackout period has been\ndesignated.\nV. EXCEPTIONS TO APPLICATION OF POLICY\nA. Employee Benefit Plans / Stock Option Plans\nThe trading prohibitions and restrictions set forth in this Policy do not apply to periodic contributions\nby the Company or employees to the Schmid Stock Option Plan (\"SSOP\") pursuant to the terms and\nconditions of those plans. However, no officer or employee of SCHMID may alter his or her instructions\nregarding the purchase or sale of Company Securities in such plans while they are aware of material\nnon-public information. The sale of Company Securities received under a certain Option Plan is subject\nto the terms of this Policy.\nInsiders may exercise company stock options where no company stock is sold in the market. Cashless\nsales - e.g., \"cashless sales\" where company stock is sold to pay for exercising the options - are\nconsidered under this Policy to be transactions in Company Securities and must comply with the\nprovisions of this Policy, including the applicability of any prior approval, trading window or blackout\n4\nperiod requirements as they may apply to an Insider. No cashless sale is permitted when the insider is\nin possession of material non-public information, except as provided below.\nC. Rule 10b5-1 Plans\nExchange Act Rule 10b5-l was adopted by the SEC to protect persons from insider trading liability for\ntransactions under a written trading plan previously established at a time when the insider did not\npossess material non-public information. Under a properly established 10b5-1 plan with respect to\nsecurities (a \"10b5-1 Plan\"), Insiders may complete transactions in Company Securities at any time,\nincluding during blackout periods and outside trading windows or even when the Insider possesses\nmaterial non-public information. Thus, a 10b5-1 Plan offers an opportunity for Insiders to establish a\nsystematic program of transactions in Company Securities over periods of time that might include\nperiods in which such transactions would otherwise be prohibited under the federal securities laws or\nthis policy. A variety of arrangements can be structured to meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1. In\nparticular, a 10b5-1 Plan can take the form of a blind trust, other trust, pre-scheduled stock option\nexercises and sales, pre-arranged trading instructions and other brokerage and third-party arrangements\nover which the Insider has no control once the plan takes effect.\nInsiders who desire to implement a 10b5-1 Plan must first obtain approval of the plan by the Legal\nAffairs department of SCHMID. To be eligible for approval, the 10b5-1 Plan:\n• Must be established during a trading window (and not during any blackout period);\n• Must be in writing;\n• Must either irrevocably set forth the future date or dates on which purchase or sale of securities\nare to be made, the prices at which the securities are to be purchased or sold, the broker who\nwill be responsible for effecting the transactions (or method of transaction if not through a\nbroker), or provide a formula for determining the price of the securities to be purchased or sold\nand the date or dates on which the transactions are to be completed;\n• May not permit the direct or indirect exercise of any influence over the timing or terms of the\npurchase or sale by the Insider; and\n• May not take effect until two days after the plan is approved by the Legal department of\nSCHMID.\nThe Legal Affairs department of SCHMID will maintain a copy of all 10b5-1 Plans.\nThe Insider must provide the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID written notice of any termination\nor modification (in which case, the modification must be approved in writing by the Legal Affairs\ndepartment of SCHMID prior to effectiveness and may not take effect until two days after the plan is\napproved by the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID.\nVI. REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS\nAny Insider who violates this Policy or any U.S. federal, state or stock exchange rules or law governing\ninsider trading or tipping, or knows of any such violation by any other Insider, must report the violation\nimmediately to the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID via SCHMID's whistleblowing system\n(https://schmid-group.hintbox.eu/) or to the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID. Upon receipt of\nnotice of a potential violation of this Policy, the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID:\n• Shall determine whether a violation may have occurred;\n5\n• Shall report the potential violation of this Policy to the Audit Committee if the Legal Affairs\ndepartment of SCHMID concludes a violation occurred or if the Legal Affairs department of\nSCHMID is unable to conclude that no violation occurred; and\n• Upon determining that any such violation has occurred, in consultation with the Chair of the\nAudit Committee of the Board, will determine whether the Company should release any\nmaterial non-public information.\nIf the Legal Affairs department of SCHMID or the Audit Committee determines that a violation of the\nPolicy occurred, they may discipline the Insider, including immediate termination. The Audit\nCommittee may also report the violation to federal or state law enforcement agencies and/or applicable\nSRO.\nVII.

SCHMID wants to\nbe perceived not only as a market and technology leader, but above all as a serious, credible,\nand reliable partner.\nWe1 want to ensure that at all times our actions are impeccable, correct, and exemplary. The Code of\nConduct is based on our corporate mission statement. The aim of this Code is to ensure compliance\nwith laws, standards, and guidelines throughout the company to create a working environment\ncharacterized by integrity, respect and fair and responsible conduct.\nAt the same time, it serves to establish a reliable compliance culture in the company and to encourage\nemployees to uncover wrongdoing. It is valid and binding for every employee and everybody in the\ncompany - worldwide. The requirements of the Code of Conduct should not only be formally observed,\nbut should also be practiced and lived in accordance with their meaning and purpose. That is why we\nhave decided to provide the form of presentation and also the mandatory training courses with\nexamples accordingly, in order to get the reality of life closer to our Code of Conduct. This is the\nreason why we provide this written document in addition to mandatory training courses.\nLet us bring an open and legally compliant corporate and compliance culture to life each day.\nThe General Management\nChristian Schmid\nCEO\n1 In this Code of Conduct, 'we' always means all employees, executives, and members of the management of\nany company of the SCHMID Group.\nCode of Conduct 3 | 30\nSCHMID Code of Conduct\nWhy do we have a Code of Conduct?\nAt SCHMID, the Code of Conduct serves as a\nbinding guideline in our day-to-day work. It is\nsupplemented by internal guidelines and\nregulations as well as contractual agreements.\nThe contents of the Code of Conduct are\nembedded in concrete case studies and\nscenarios to illustrate possible risk situations in\nthe company in a practical way. It therefore\nreflects the essential rules of conduct for\neveryday business.\nFailure to comply with the Code of Conduct can\nresult in significant damage, not only to our\ncompany but also to us as employees and to our\nbusiness partners and other stakeholders such as\ninvestors. The Code of Conduct is therefore\nbinding for all of us, irrespective of whether we\nact as employees, managers, or directors in the\ncompany. We do not tolerate violations of the\nCode of Conduct. Anyone who violates the Code\nof Conduct must face appropriate consequences.\nTo ensure that this does not happen, it is the\nresponsibility of every SCHMID employee to\nfamiliarize themselves with the contents of the\nCode of Conduct, to incorporate it into their own\nbehavior and to take it into account when making\ndecisions. In cases of doubt, we should ask for\ncompetent advice.\nTo whom does the Code of Conduct apply?\nThe Code of Conduct applies to ALL AT SCHMID\n- no matter in which function, no matter where in\nthe world.\nIn addition, all managers must provide guidance\nand support so that all employees can make the\nright decisions and behave properly.\nHow is the Code of Conduct structured?\nThe Code of Conduct comprises the following\nthree key areas:\n- Acting responsibly in accordance with\nthe law and ethics as a central guiding\nprinciple of our actions\n- Acting responsibly as a member of\nsociety\n- Acting with integrity in everyday business\nCode of Conduct 4 | 30\nActing responsibly in accordance with the law and\nethics as the central guiding principle of our actions\nCode of Conduct 5 | 30\nOur principle My Contribution\nCompliance with applicable law as well as I inform myself about the regulations applicable\ninternal guidelines is a matter of course for in my area of responsibility and comply with\nSCHMID - in all companies, in all countries in them. In cases of doubt, I contact my manager,\nwhich we operate. the Compliance Officer, or the experts\nresponsible for the respective topic.\nAs a globally active company, SCHMID must\nobserve a wide range of social, political, and\nlegal framework conditions in all its business\nprocesses, market activities and relationships\nwith business partners and third parties.\nTherefore, SCHMID's basic principle is to\nconduct our business consistently in\naccordance with legal regulations, norms,\nindustry standards and our own internal\nregulations.\nAll actions that would lead to a violation of the\nlaw are to be refrained from. There are no\nexceptions to this, not even based on\ncustomary industry or regional practices.\nEmployees who act unlawfully must be aware\nthat they themselves may be threatened with\ncriminal prosecution. Law-abiding conduct\ntherefore also serves the employee's own\nprotection.\nCode of Conduct 6 | 30\nActing responsibly as a member of society\nCode of Conduct 7 | 30\nHuman Rights Example\nYou are active in purchasing and receive\nOur principle information that one of the sub-suppliers uses\nchildren for the production of goods or\nemployees under inhumane conditions (e.g.,\nWe as SCHMID - respect, protect and promote\nforced labor).\nworldwide the applicable regulations for the\nprotection of human and children's rights as\nProblem\nfundamental and universally valid\nSuch an approach is not in line with\nspecifications.

I observe human\nrights as a fundamental guideline and am alert\nto human rights violations that happen in my\nenvironment.\nIf I have indications of human rights violations\nin my professional environment, I ensure that\nthese violations are prevented or stopped. If\nnecessary, I inform my supervisor or the\nrelevant contact persons.\nCode of Conduct 8 | 30\nSustainability Example\nBecause an internal process is to be adapted,\nTo identify potential risks for employees, the\nan on-site appointment is first planned with\nenvironment or society at an early stage, to\ncolleagues from a subsidiary.\nreduce the ecological footprint and to\ncontinuously expand the positive impact on\nProblem\nsociety, sustainability must always be\nA business trip is always associated\nconsidered in all major decisions.\nwith costs and environmentally\nharmful CO2 emissions.\nOur principle Solution\nBefore booking a business trip,\nplease check whether a flight is\nAs a commercial enterprise, we have\nnecessary or whether a video\nresponsibility for the environmental\nconference would also serve its\ncompatibility and sustainability of our products,\npurpose.

In case it is decided that the respective Director has a Conflict of\nInterest, he may not participate in the consultation and decision-making of the Board\nregarding such resolution. A Director who in connection with a Conflict of Interest does\nnot exercise certain duties and powers will insofar be regarded as a Director who is\nunable to act (belet).

The provisions with respect to\nConflict of Interest laid down in Clauses 15.5 and 15.6 shall also apply.\n15.11 The minutes of the meetings of the Board shall in evidence of their adoption be signed\nby the chairperson of the meeting of the Board and at least one other Director or the\nCompany Secretary.\n- 12 -\n16.

Claims will include derivative actions brought on\nbehalf of the Company or a group company (groepsmaatschappij) thereof or their\n- 14 -\nrespective equity holders or creditors against the Indemnified Person and Claims by the\nCompany or a group company (groepsmaatschappij) thereof or their respective equity\nholders or creditors for reimbursement for Claims by third parties on the ground that\nany such Indemnified Person was jointly liable to that third party in addition to the\nCompany or a group company (groepsmaatschappij) thereof or their respective equity\nholders or creditors.\n19.2 The Indemnified Person will not be indemnified with respect to Claims in so far as such\nClaims relate to fraud (bedrog) committed by such Indemnified Person, or if the\nIndemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable for wilful misconduct (opzet)\nor gross negligence (bewuste roekeloosheid), provided that such fraud (bedrog), wilful\nmisconduct (opzet) or gross negligence (bewuste roekeloosheid), as the case may be,\nhad been adjudicated to have been the direct and primary cause for the Claim for which\nindemnification hereunder is sought by a competent court with jurisdiction over the\nmatter, in a final non-appealable judgment, order or decree.\n19.3 Any expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and litigation costs) (together the\n\"Expenses\") incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with any Legal Action,\nshall be reimbursed by the Company, but only upon receipt of a written undertaking by\nthat Indemnified Person that he shall repay such advanced Expenses if a competent\ncourt with jurisdiction over the matter, in a final non-appealable judgment, order or\ndecree, should determine that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified\nhereunder in respect of such Legal Action. Expenses shall be deemed to include any\ntax liability that the Indemnified Person may incur as a result of his indemnification or\nreimbursement hereunder.\n19.4 If a Legal Action against any Indemnified Person by the Company or a group company\n(groepsmaatschappij) thereof occurs, the Company will advance to the Indemnified\nPerson his reasonable Expenses, but only upon receipt of a written undertaking by that\nIndemnified Person that he shall repay such Expenses in the event a competent court\nwith jurisdiction over the matter, in a final non-appealable judgment, order or decree,\nshould resolve the Legal Action in favour of the Company rather than the Indemnified\nPerson.\n19.5 The Indemnified Person shall not admit any personal financial liability vis-à-vis third\nparties, or enter into any settlement agreement, with respect to any Legal Action for\nwhich he seeks indemnification hereunder, without the prior written authorisation of\nthe Company (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
