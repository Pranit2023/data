(Nasdaq: OXLC) (NasdaqGS: OXLCP) (NasdaqGS: OXLCL) (NasdaqGS: OXLCO) (NasdaqGS: OXLCZ) (NasdaqGS: OXLCN) (NasdaqGM: OXLCI) (“Oxford Lane,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) announced today the following financial results and related information: \n\n  * On July 25, 2024, our Board of Directors declared the following distributions on our common stock:\n\n\n\n**Month Ending**| **Record Date**| **Payment Date**| **Amount Per Share**  \n---|---|---|---  \nOctober 31, 2024| October 17, 2024| October 31, 2024| $0.09  \nNovember 30, 2024| November 15, 2024| November 29, 2024| $0.09  \nDecember 31, 2024| December 17, 2024| December 31, 2024| $0.09  \n  \n  * Net asset value (“NAV”) per share as of June 30, 2024 stood at $4.91, compared with a NAV per share on March 31, 2024 of $4.90.\n  * Net investment income (“NII”), calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), was approximately $56.0 million, or $0.22 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n  * Our core net investment income (“Core NII”) was approximately $107.2 million, or $0.41 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n    * Core NII incorporates all applicable cash distributions received, or entitled to be received (if any, in either case), on our collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) equity investments. **See additional information under “Supplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income” below**.\n    * We emphasize that our taxable income may differ materially from our GAAP NII and/or our Core NII, and that neither GAAP NII nor Core NII should be relied upon as indicators of our taxable income.\n  * Total investment income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 amounted to approximately $89.8 million, which represented an increase of approximately $7.1 million from the quarter ended March 31, 2024. \n    * For the quarter ended June 30, 2024 we recorded investment income as follows: \n      * Approximately $84.0 million from our CLO equity and CLO warehouse investments, and\n      * Approximately $5.7 million from our CLO debt investments and other income.\n  * Our total expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were approximately $33.8 million, compared with total expenses of approximately $31.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n  * As of June 30, 2024, the following metrics applied (note that none of these metrics represented a total return to shareholders): \n    * The weighted average yield of our CLO debt investments at current cost was 17.4%, up from 17.1% as of March 31, 2024.\n    * The weighted average effective yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 16.8%, down from 16.9% as of March 31, 2024.\n    * The weighted average cash distribution yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 26.9%, up from 23.5% as of March 31, 2024. \n\n\n  * For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $47.7 million, or $0.18 per share, comprised of: \n    * NII of approximately $56.0 million;\n    * Net realized gains of approximately $6.1 million; and\n    * Net unrealized depreciation of approximately $14.4 million. \n\n\n  * During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we made additional investments of approximately $216.9 million, and received approximately $96.3 million from sales and repayments of our CLO investments.\n  * For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we issued a total of approximately 45.9 million shares of common stock pursuant to an “at-the-market” offering. After deducting the sales agent’s commissions and offering expenses, this resulted in net proceeds of approximately $242.1 million. As of June 30, 2024, we had approximately 287.0 million shares of common stock outstanding.\n  * On July 25, 2024, our Board of Directors declared the required monthly dividends on our 6.25% Series 2027 Term Preferred Shares, 6.00% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares, and 7.125% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares as follows:\n\n\n\n**Preferred****Shares Type**| **Per Share**| **Record Dates**| **Payment Dates**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Dividend**  \n**Amount**  \n**Declared**  \n**6.25% - Series 2027**|  $| 0.13020833| September 16, 2024, October 17, 2024, November 15, 2024| September 30, 2024, October 31, 2024,November 29, 2024  \n**6.00% - Series 2029**|  $| 0.12500000| September 16, 2024, October 17, 2024, November 15, 2024| September 30, 2024, October 31, 2024, November 29, 2024  \n**7.125% - Series 2029**|  $| 0.14843750| September 16, 2024, October 17, 2024, November 15, 2024| September 30, 2024, October 31, 2024, November 29, 2024  \n  \nIn accordance with their terms, each of the 6.25% Series 2027 Term Preferred Shares, 6.00% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares, and 7.125% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares will pay a monthly dividend at a fixed rate of 6.25%, 6.00% and 7.125%, respectively, of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference, or $1.5625, $1.5000 and $1.78125 per share per year, respectively. This fixed annual dividend rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances, but will not, in any case, be lower than 6.25%, 6.00% and 7.125% per year, respectively, for each of the 6.25% Series 2027 Term Preferred Shares, 6.00% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares and 7.125% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares.\n\n**Supplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income**\n\nWe provide information relating to Core NII (a non-GAAP measure) on a supplemental basis. This measure is not provided as a substitute for GAAP NII, but in addition to it. Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even in the event of similar terms being utilized to identify such measures. Core NII represents GAAP NII adjusted for additional applicable cash distributions received, or entitled to be received (if any, in either case), on our CLO equity investments. Oxford Lane’s management uses this information in its internal analysis of results and believes that this information may be informative in assessing the quality of Oxford Lane’s financial performance, identifying trends in its results and providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons.\n\nIncome from investments in the “equity” class securities of CLO vehicles, for GAAP purposes, is recorded using the effective interest method; this is based on an effective yield to the expected redemption utilizing estimated cash flows, at current cost, including those CLO equity investments that have not made their inaugural distribution for the relevant period end. The result is an effective yield for the investment in which the respective investment’s cost basis is adjusted quarterly based on the difference between the actual cash received, or distributions entitled to be received, and the effective yield calculation. Accordingly, investment income recognized on CLO equity securities in the GAAP statement of operations differs from the cash distributions actually received by the Company during the period (referred to below as “CLO equity adjustments”). \n\nFurthermore, in order for the Company to continue qualifying as a regulated investment company for tax purposes, we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income annually. While Core NII may provide a better indication of our estimated taxable income than GAAP NII during certain periods, we can offer no assurance that will be the case, however, as the ultimate tax character of our earnings cannot be determined until after tax returns are prepared at the close of a fiscal year. We note that this non-GAAP measure may not serve as a useful indicator of taxable earnings, particularly during periods of market disruption and volatility, and, as such, our taxable income may differ materially from our Core NII.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP NII to Core NII for the three months ended June 30, 2024:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024**  \n**Per Share**  \n**Amount**| **Amount**  \nGAAP net investment income| $| 55,954,863| $| 0.22  \nCLO equity adjustments| 51,279,902| 0.19  \nCore net investment income| $| 107,234,765| $| 0.41  \n  \nWe will host a conference call to discuss our first quarter results today, Friday, July 26, 2024 at 9:00 AM ET. Please call 1-833-470-1428, access code number 978856 to participate. A recording of the conference call will be available for replay for approximately 30 days following the call.

(Nasdaq: OXLC) (NasdaqGS: OXLCP) (NasdaqGS: OXLCL) (NasdaqGS: OXLCO) (NasdaqGS: OXLCZ) (NasdaqGS: OXLCN) (NasdaqGS: OXLCI) (“Oxford Lane,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) announced today the following financial results and related information: \n\n  * On October 24, 2024, our Board of Directors declared the following distributions on our common stock:\n\n\n\n**Month Ending**| **Record Date**| **Payment Date**| **Amount Per Share**  \n---|---|---|---  \nJanuary 31, 2025| January 17, 2025| January 31, 2025| $0.09  \nFebruary 28, 2025| February 14, 2025| February 28, 2025| $0.09  \nMarch 31, 2025| March 17, 2025| March 31, 2025| $0.09  \n  \n  * Net asset value (“NAV”) per share as of September 30, 2024 stood at $4.76, compared with a NAV per share on June 30, 2024 of $4.91.\n  * Net investment income (“NII”), calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), was approximately $67.2 million, or $0.22 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n  * Our core net investment income (“Core NII”) was approximately $99.4 million, or $0.32 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n    * Core NII incorporates all applicable cash distributions received, or entitled to be received (if any, in either case), on our collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) equity investments. **See additional information under “Supplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income” below**.\n    * We emphasize that our taxable income may differ materially from our GAAP NII and/or our Core NII, and that neither GAAP NII nor Core NII should be relied upon as indicators of our taxable income.\n  * Total investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 amounted to approximately $105.1 million, which represented an increase of approximately $15.4 million from the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n    * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 we recorded investment income as follows: \n      * Approximately $98.3 million from our CLO equity and CLO warehouse investments, and\n      * Approximately $6.8 million from our CLO debt investments and other income.\n  * Our total expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were approximately $37.9 million, compared with total expenses of approximately $33.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the following metrics applied (note that none of these metrics represented a total return to shareholders): \n    * The weighted average yield of our CLO debt investments at current cost was 17.3%, down from 17.4% as of June 30, 2024.\n    * The weighted average effective yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 16.5%, down from 16.8% as of June 30, 2024.\n    * The weighted average cash distribution yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 24.1%, down from 26.9% as of June 30, 2024.\n\n\n  * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $17.9 million, or $0.06 per share, comprised of: \n    * NII of approximately $67.2 million;\n    * Net realized gains of approximately $3.2 million; and\n    * Net unrealized depreciation of approximately $52.5 million.\n\n\n  * During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we made additional investments of approximately $540.0 million, and received approximately $160.2 million from sales and repayments of our CLO investments.\n  * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we issued a total of approximately 48.1 million shares of common stock pursuant to an “at-the-market” offering. After deducting the sales agent’s commissions and offering expenses, this resulted in net proceeds of approximately $252.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 337.3 million shares of common stock outstanding.\n  * On October 24, 2024, our Board of Directors declared the required monthly dividends on our 6.25% Series 2027 Term Preferred Shares, 6.00% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares, and 7.125% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares as follows:\n\n\n\n**Preferred****Shares Type**| **Per Share Dividend Amount Declared**| **Record Dates**| **Payment Dates**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**6.25% - Series 2027**|  $| 0.13020833 | December 17, 2024, January 17, 2025, February 14, 2025| December 31, 2024, January 31, 2025, February 28, 2025  \n**6.00% - Series 2029**|  $| 0.12500000 | December 17, 2024, January 17, 2025, February 14, 2025| December 31, 2024, January 31, 2025, February 28, 2025  \n**7.125% - Series 2029**|  $| 0.14843750 | December 17, 2024, January 17, 2025, February 14, 2025| December 31, 2024, January 31, 2025, February 28, 2025  \n  \nIn accordance with their terms, each of the 6.25% Series 2027 Term Preferred Shares, 6.00% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares, and 7.125% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares will pay a monthly dividend at a fixed rate of 6.25%, 6.00% and 7.125%, respectively, of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference, or $1.5625, $1.5000 and $1.78125 per share per year, respectively. This fixed annual dividend rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances, but will not, in any case, be lower than 6.25%, 6.00% and 7.125% per year, respectively, for each of the 6.25% Series 2027 Term Preferred Shares, 6.00% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares and 7.125% Series 2029 Term Preferred Shares.\n\n**Supplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income**\n\nWe provide information relating to Core NII (a non-GAAP measure) on a supplemental basis. This measure is not provided as a substitute for GAAP NII, but in addition to it. Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even in the event of similar terms being utilized to identify such measures. Core NII represents GAAP NII adjusted for additional applicable cash distributions received, or entitled to be received (if any, in either case), on our CLO equity investments. Oxford Lane’s management uses this information in its internal analysis of results and believes that this information may be informative in assessing the quality of Oxford Lane’s financial performance, identifying trends in its results and providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons.\n\nIncome from investments in the “equity” class securities of CLO vehicles, for GAAP purposes, is recorded using the effective interest method; this is based on an effective yield to the expected redemption utilizing estimated cash flows, at current cost, including those CLO equity investments that have not made their inaugural distribution for the relevant period end. The result is an effective yield for the investment in which the respective investment’s cost basis is adjusted quarterly based on the difference between the actual cash received, or distributions entitled to be received, and the effective yield calculation. Accordingly, investment income recognized on CLO equity securities in the GAAP statement of operations differs from the cash distributions actually received by the Company during the period (referred to below as “CLO equity adjustments”). \n\nFurthermore, in order for the Company to continue qualifying as a regulated investment company for tax purposes, we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income annually. While Core NII may provide a better indication of our estimated taxable income than GAAP NII during certain periods, we can offer no assurance that will be the case, however, as the ultimate tax character of our earnings cannot be determined until after tax returns are prepared at the close of a fiscal year. We note that this non-GAAP measure may not serve as a useful indicator of taxable earnings, particularly during periods of market disruption and volatility, and, as such, our taxable income may differ materially from our Core NII.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP NII to Core NII for the three months ended September 30, 2024:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**  \n**Amount**| **Per ShareAmount**  \nGAAP net investment income| $| 67,188,478| $| 0.22  \nCLO equity adjustments| 32,164,525| 0.10  \nCore net investment income| $| 99,353,003| $| 0.32  \n  \nWe will host a conference call to discuss our second quarter results today, Friday, November 1, 2024 at 9:00 AM ET. Please call 1-833-470-1428, access code number 436588 to participate. A recording of the conference call will be available for replay for approximately 30 days following the call.
