To specify, the Company will apply the achievement\nratio against consolidated operating profit targets (however, 0% for achievement ratio of less than 70%\nand 100% for achievement ratio of more than 100%) and cancel Transfer Restrictions, and acquire gratis\nany Allotted Shares I of which Transfer Restrictions are not cancelled. However, if the Allottee has\nforfeited the Position before the expiration of Transfer Restriction Period I owing to the expiration of term\nof office or other reasons deemed legitimate by the Board of Directors of the Company, Transfer\nRestrictions shall be cancelled on a number of Allotted Shares I equal to the number of Allotted Shares I\nheld by the Allottee at that time multiplied by the transfer restriction cancellation ratio above upon\nexpiration of Transfer Restriction Period I.\n(Restricted Stock II)\n4\nUpon expiration of Transfer Restriction Period II, the Company will cancel Transfer Restrictions for all\nAllotted Shares II held by an Allottee as of that time under the condition that the Allottee has\ncontinuously been in office in the Position during the Service Provision Period. However, if the Allottee\nhas retired from the Position before the expiration of the Service Provision Period owing to reasons\ndeemed legitimate by the Board of Directors of the Company, Transfer Restrictions shall be cancelled on\nall Allotted Shares II held by the Allottee at that time.\n(4) Provisions concerning share management\nAllottees are to complete opening an account to enter or record the Allotted Shares I and Allotted Shares II\nwith Nomura Securities Co., Ltd. via a method designated by the Company and store and maintain the\nAllotted Shares I and Allotted Shares II in the said account until cancellation of the Transfer Restrictions.\n(5) Handling of organizational restructuring, etc.\nIf during Transfer Restriction Period I or Transfer Restriction Period II, approval is granted at a General\nMeeting of Shareholders of the Company (however, if approval from a General Meeting of Shareholders of\nthe Company is not required for said organizational restructuring, etc., the Board of Directors) for a proposal\nfor a merger agreement wherein the Company is the dissolving company, a share exchange agreement or\nshare transfer plan wherein the Company becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary, or other organizational\nrestructuring, etc. (however, only if the effective date of said organizational restructuring, etc., is before the\nexpiration of Transfer Restriction Period I or Transfer Restriction Period II), the Transfer Restrictions will not\nbe canceled on any of the Allotted Shares I regardless of the level of achievement against consolidated\noperating profit targets, but will be cancelled on all of the Allotted Shares II. In this case, the Company will\ncancel Transfer Restrictions on all Allotted Shares II on the business day immediately preceding the effective\ndate of said organizational restructuring, etc.\n4. Calculation based and specific content of paid-in amount\nTo ensure that arbitrary factors are excluded, the issuance price of the New Share Issuance has been set at\n740 yen, the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on the business day\nimmediately preceding (November 21, 2024) the resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company. This is\nthe market price on the day immediately preceding the resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company,\nand the Company believes that this is rational and cannot be considered a particularly advantageous price.\n5. Matters concerning transactions with majority shareholders, etc.\n(1) Appropriateness of transactions with majority shareholders, etc., and status of compliance with policies\nregarding measures to protect minority shareholders\nSome portions of the New Share Issuance have Shinsuke Sakimoto, the Company’s Representative\nDirector, as the Allottee. He is a shareholder holding 99.3% of the voting rights of SF Property Management\nInc., the majority shareholder of the Company, and as he concurrently serves as Representative Director of\nthe said Company, this classifies as a transaction with a majority shareholder, etc.\nThe “Guidelines on Measures to Protect Minority Shareholders during Dealings with Majority\n5\nShareholders” recorded in the Corporate Governance Report disclosed by the Company on November 22,\n2024, is as follows.\n“When considering transactions with controlling shareholders or close family members of said\nshareholders, Valuence Holdings Inc. may, after deliberating the details and validity of the transactions at a\nmeeting of the board of directors, approve such transactions. Such transactions are predicated on an\nunderlying necessity, subject to the same basic terms and conditions as normal transactions and allowed\nregardless of the financial amount involved. Through this process, the company strives to protect the\ninterests of minority shareholders.”\nThe New Share Issuance was determined according to this policy.\n(2) Matters concerning measures to secure fairness and measures to avoid conflicts of interest\nThe New Share Issuance is implemented in accordance with regulations and procedures stipulated by laws,\nregulations, and various statutes. Additionally, concerning the method for determining the paid-in amount and\nother content and conditions of the issuance as well, as stated in “2. Objectives and reasons for issuance”\nabove, the restricted stock compensation is typical in content and condition and is appropriate, has been\nreported to the Board of Directors after deliberation in the Nomination and Compensation Committee, and\nreceived a resolution at the meeting at the Board of Directors. Furthermore, from the perspective of avoiding\nconflicts of interest, Shinsuke Sakimoto, the Company’s Representative Director, has not participated in the\ndeliberation at the Nomination and Compensation Committee and the deliberation and resolution in the Board\nof Directors regarding the New Share Issuance.\n(3) Summary of opinion from a party with no interest in the majority shareholder stating that said transaction,\netc., will not cause harm interests to the minority shareholders\nThe validity of the content and conditions of the New Share Issuance has been reported to the Company’s\nBoard of Directors after deliberation in the Nomination and Compensation Committee and has been resolved\nby the Board of Directors. Additionally, Chairperson of the Nomination and Compensation Committee\nTakashi Goto (Outside Director who is the Audit and Supervisory Committee Member; Independent Officer)\nprovided the following opinion concerning the determination of this New Share Issuance on November 21,\n2024.\n1 Regarding the objective of the New Share Issuance\nThe New Share Issuance will be conducted based on the System, which is the “Restricted Stock\nCompensation System” introduced by the Board of Directors meeting of the Company held on\nOctober 15, 2018 and the 7th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of the Company held on\nNovember 22, 2018. In addition, at the 10th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of the\nCompany held on November 25, 2021, the Company resolved to revise compensation related to the\nSystem, as part of measures to revise the compensation system for Directors of the Company\n(excluding Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee Members).\nThis New Share Issuance based on the System has the objective of further increasing the desire by\nDirectors (excluding Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee Members and Outside\n6\nDirectors) and employees of the Company and Directors and employees of the Company’s\nsubsidiaries to contribute to a higher share price and the improvement of corporate value by having\nthem share the benefits and risks of changes in the share price with shareholders. It can also be\nthought that providing stock to Allottees, including Shinsuke Sakimoto, will work to share value\nbetween Allottees and shareholders while also further increasing the desire to contribute to a higher\nshare price and the improvement of corporate value, and therefore the New Share Issuance will\ncontribute to improving the corporate value of the Company group.\n2 Regarding the validity of the content and conditions, etc., of the New Share Issuance\nThe following are recognized regarding the validity of the content and conditions of the New Share\nIssuance.\n(1) The number of shares of common stock of the Company subject to issuance is a total of 208,900\nshares (of which, the number planned to be allotted to Mr. Sakimoto is 65,600 shares; of which,\n38,300 shares of Restricted Stock I and 27,300 shares of Restricted Stock II), and the ratio against\nthe total number of issued shares (13,532,950 shares as of August 31, 2024) is 1.54%. (rounded to\nthe second decimal place; the combined number of Restricted Stock I and Restricted Stock II\nplanned to be allotted to Mr. Sakimoto is 0.48%), and the ratio of diffusion is insignificant.\n(2) The issuance price is 740 yen, the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Tokyo\nStock Exchange on the business day immediately preceding (November 21, 2024) the resolution by\nthe Company’s Board of Directors. This is the market price on the day immediately preceding the\nresolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, the price reflects that arbitrary factors were\nexcluded from the determination process, and it can be though that it is rational and not a\nparticularly advantageous price.\n(3) In undertaking the New Share Issuance, the content of the Restricted Stock Allotment Agreement\nfor this New Share Issuance planned to be concluded with Allottees, including Mr. Sakimoto, is\nthought to be typical in content and conditions and appropriate in comparison with restricted stock\nallotment agreements typically found in restricted stock compensation systems at other companies\nof the same type.\nIn consideration of the above, the content and conditions of the New Share Issuance are valid.\n3 Regarding the fairness of the determination process of the New Share Issuance\nThe following are recognized regarding the determination process of the New Share Issuance.\n(1) As stated in 2. (3) above, the content and conditions of the New Share Issuance are thought to be\ntypical in content and conditions and appropriate as restricted stock compensation.\n(2) The New Share Issuance is planned to be implemented based on laws and regulations such as the\nCompanies Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, statutes stipulated by the Tokyo\nStock Exchange, and internal statutes at the Company, and no particular content in violation of\nthese has been recognized.\n7\n(3) In undertaking the New Share Issuance, after deliberation and report to the Board of Director of the\nCompany by the Nomination and Compensation Committee for which an Audit & Supervisory\nCommittee Member who is an Outside Director and Independent Officer of the Company, a\nresolution is planned to be conducted by the Board of Directors of the Company, and Mr. Sakimoto\nis not planned to participate in the deliberation and resolution for said resolution.\nIn consideration of the above, the determination process of the New Share Issuance is fair.\n4 Conclusion\nIn consideration of the content of the above items 1 through 3, the determination of matters\npertaining to the New Share Issuance does not harm the interests of minority shareholders of the\nCompany.\n8"
