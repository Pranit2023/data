Letter from Nasdaq\")\n\nVISTA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Flux Power Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: [FLUX](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/flux)), a developer of advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions for electrification of commercial and industrial equipment, today announced that on November 20, 2024, it received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of not having filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 (“Form 10-Q”) and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 (“Form 10-K”), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). \n\nThis notification has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq rules, the Company has until December 16, 2024, to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule. If Nasdaq accepts the Company’s plan, then Nasdaq may grant the Company up to 180 days from the prescribed due date for the Form 10-K to regain compliance, or April 14, 2025. If Nasdaq does not accept the Company’s plan, then the Company will have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. \n\nThe Company is working diligently to complete its Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and plans to file its Form 10-K and Form 10-Q as promptly as practicable to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. \n\n**About Flux Power Holdings, Inc.**\n\nFlux Power (NASDAQ: FLUX) designs, manufactures, and sells advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions for electrification of a range of industrial and commercial sectors including material handling, airport ground support equipment (GSE), and stationary energy storage. Flux Power’s lithium-ion battery packs, including the proprietary battery management system (BMS) and telemetry, provide customers with a better performing, lower cost of ownership, and more environmentally friendly alternative, in many instances, to traditional lead acid and propane-based solutions. Lithium-ion battery packs reduce CO2 emissions and help improve sustainability and ESG metrics for fleets.

WIRE)-- **Flux Power Holdings, Inc.**(NASDAQ:[ FLUX](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/flux)), a developer of advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions for electrification of commercial and industrial equipment, today announced that its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ron Dutt, intends to retire from the Company. The Company’s Board of Directors is executing a comprehensive succession plan and search to identify the next CEO with the assistance of a nationally recognized search firm. Mr. Dutt will remain in his roles until the search for his successor is complete. \n\nMr. Dutt commented, “It has been my honor to serve as Flux’s Chairman and CEO over the last 12 years, and I'm extremely proud of the team's many accomplishments. From our early days as a pre-revenue start-up and developing the market-penetrating “lithium-ion battery pack” for the high volume ‘walkie’ pallet jack, to becoming a thriving business and recognized provider of innovative energy solutions for the motive lift and ground support equipment markets, it has been a privilege to be a part of this company. I am grateful to the entire Flux team for what we were able to achieve together, and I look forward to supporting my successor through a successful transition.” \n\n“On behalf of the Board, management team, and employees, I want to thank Ron for his exceptional leadership and continued dedication to Flux Power,” said Director Michael Johnson. “Since joining as a Director at the company’s incorporation, I have seen Ron’s commitment to fostering a culture of mutual respect and integrity that has been foundational to the company’s success. His vision and dedication have been pivotal in the formation, development, and sustained growth of Flux Power. The Board of Directors and the entire Flux team appreciate his outstanding leadership and the lasting impact he has made on the organization. Looking ahead, we are committed to identifying the best candidate to continue our mission and build upon our strong foundation, and we look forward to working with Ron to ensure a smooth transition.” \n\n**About Flux Power Holdings, Inc.**\n\nFlux Power (NASDAQ: FLUX) designs, manufactures, and sells advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions for electrification of a range of industrial and commercial sectors including material handling, airport ground support equipment (GSE), and stationary energy storage.

](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_999d5997e3a7482089ca06c494e855dc/fluxpower/news/2024-11-15_Flux_Power_Provides_Update_on_Inventory_196.pdf \"PDF: Flux Power Provides Update on Inventory Restatement and Timeline to Report Fiscal FY 2024 and Q1 2025 Financial Results\")\n\nVISTA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- **Flux Power Holdings, Inc.**(NASDAQ: [FLUX](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/flux)), a developer of advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions for electrification of commercial and industrial equipment, today provided an update regarding its previously discussed restatement process and subsequent SEC filings for the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended June 30, 2024, and the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\nOn September 5, 2024, Flux announced that it had identified approximately $1.7 million of excess and obsolete inventory primarily related to product innovation and design of its products during a period of rapid growth over the last several years. A further detailed review of this and related items has resulted in estimated noncash inventory write-downs of approximately $4.4 million and related noncash warranty related items of approximately $0.5 million, totaling adjustments of approximately $4.9 million. This impact is not a one-time adjustment but impacting multiple quarters over multiple years. To properly reflect the obsolete inventory, the Company is currently in the process of restating previously issued financial statements for fiscal year 2023 and the interim periods of fiscal year 2024, which will be reflected in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The Flux team has completed its internal review of the restatements and 10-K and is working with its auditors to file them as soon as practicable, which reflects a large body of work over an extended period of time. Upon completion, Flux will work to complete the 10-Q filing for the quarter ending September 30, 2024. \n\n“Flux continues to execute on our strategy, which includes expanding sales and marketing initiatives to secure new customer relationships, developing additional technologies and building new partnerships, and we are making good progress as we strive to deliver on our targeted sales trajectory,” said Ron Dutt, CEO of Flux Power. “Our outlook remains positive as we diligently follow our roadmap to achieve profitability by focusing on continued innovation, maintaining a disciplined cost structure and driving organic growth. We look forward to providing our shareholders with financial updates as soon as we finalize our Fiscal Year 2024 10-K and First Quarter 2025 10-Q filings.” \n\nAdditional information is available in the Form 12b-25 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today and the Form 8-K filed on September 5, 2024. \n\n**About Flux Power Holdings, Inc.**\n\nFlux Power (NASDAQ: FLUX) designs, manufactures, and sells advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions for electrification of a range of industrial and commercial sectors including material handling, airport ground support equipment (GSE), and stationary energy storage. Flux Power’s lithium-ion battery packs, including the proprietary battery management system (BMS) and telemetry, provide customers with a better performing, lower cost of ownership, and more environmentally friendly alternative, in many instances, to traditional lead acid and propane-based solutions. Lithium-ion battery packs reduce CO2 emissions and help improve sustainability and ESG metrics for fleets.

Eastern Time_\n\nVISTA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- **Flux Power Holdings, Inc.** (NASDAQ: [FLUX](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/flux)), a developer of advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions for electrification of commercial and industrial equipment, has reported its financial and operational results for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2024. \n\n**Key Financial FY 2024 Third Quarter and Subsequent Operational Highlights and Business**\n\n**($ millions)** |  **Q3 Comparison**  \n---|---  \n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **_$ Change YoY_** |  **_% Change YoY_**

timing of deliveries of customer new forklift orders and interest rate variability,” said Flux Power CEO Ron Dutt. “An Institute for Supply Management survey this month showed manufacturing grew for the first time in 1-1/2 years in March, and although we remain confident in a recovery, we are highly focused on additional selling strategies to support our historical sales trajectory. \n\n“Gross margin initiatives have dramatically improved margins over the last two years, and we expect continued improvement. Gross profit was down slightly during the third quarter to $4.4 million, and gross margin held steady at 30%, compared to the year ago period. With strategic supply chain and profitability improvement initiatives, lower costs and higher volume purchasing, we are targeting gross margin improvement to continue, with a longer-term goal exceeding 40%. \n\n“As of May 6, 2024, our open order backlog was $18.5 million. Our backlog reflects longer lead times of incoming purchase orders from major OEMs to align with their schedule of new forklift deliveries and extended delivery times for certain model lines of airlines for new Ground Support Equipment (“GSE”). These extended lead times have resulted in some shipment deferrals and delays in receiving anticipated orders. Beyond our backlog of open orders, the future continues to look bright with over $100 million in high probability orders. \n\n  * **Some delays of customer orders** stretch beyond current fiscal year ending June 30, 2024 \n    * Delays linked to forklift deferrals from higher interest rates and economic uncertainty \n    * No known lost customers nor lost orders to competition \n    * Delays rather than pullback from Lithium adoption by customers \n  * **Actions supporting targeted sales trajectory**\n    * New product launches of heavy-duty models addressing customer demand \n    * Adding salespeople to support customer demand \n    * Increasing marketing resources and initiatives \n    * Launching this quarter new Private Label program for another top Forklift OEM \n  * **Actions supporting increasing our gross margins**\n    * Selected cost reductions company wide \n    * Selected pricing increases reflecting our “total value add” to products/customers \n  * **Continued progress to expand technology and partnerships**\n    * Exploring fast charging technology with partner on selected product applications \n    * Telemetry features for customer asset management including nationwide installation \n    * Development of machine learning and AI features for product support of large fleets \n    * Automation of modularizing battery cells to launch this summer \n  * **Key Appointments:**\n    * Appointed Kevin Royal, a seasoned finance and accounting executive, as Chief Financial Officer. \n    * Appointed Mark Leposky, a senior-level executive and entrepreneur, to its Board of Directors as an independent director. \n\n\n\n**The backlog status is a point in time measure but in total reflects underlying pacing of orders:**\n\n**Fiscal Quarter Ended** |  **Beginning Backlog** |  **New Orders** |  **Shipments** |  **Ending Backlog**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nDecember 31, 2022  |  $  |  26,858,000  |  $  |  20,652,000  |  $  |  17,158,000  |  $  |  30,352,000   \nMarch 31, 2023  |  $  |  30,352,000  |  $  |  9,751,000  |  $  |  15,087,000  |  $  |  25,016,000   \nJune 30, 2023  |  $  |  25,016,000  |  $  |  19,780,000  |  $  |  16,252,000  |  $  |  28,544,000   \nSeptember 30, 2023  |  $  |  28,544,000  |  $  |  8,102,000  |  $  |  14,797,000  |  $  |  21,849,000   \nDecember 31, 2023  |  $  |  21,849,000  |  $  |  26,552,000  |  $  |  18,344,000  |  $  |  30,057,000   \nMarch 31, 2024  |  $  |  30,057,000  |  $  |  4,030,000  |  $  |  14,457,000  |  $  |  19,630,000   \n  \n**CEO Commentary Continued**\n\n“Looking ahead, we are highly focused on expanding sales and marketing initiatives to secure new customer relationships and support continued migration to lithium of current customers. We are excited to add our second tier one OEM Private Label program to supplement our strong OEM relationships and approvals. We are also working with our distribution network to expand customer acquisition with direct-to-customer initiatives. We are also leveraging our position with growth-oriented projects and developing partnerships with vendors, technology partners, and opportunities to further drive growth. \n\n“We are working to expand product lines for multiple customer segments and adjacent markets with new products and filling in gaps in energy storage offerings. Recently we introduced our new second-generation lithium-ion battery pack for Class II narrow aisle forklifts and Class I 4-wheel counterbalance forklifts and will be adding heavy duty models to most of our product line in coming months. Our telemetry, which includes asset management features, is in the pilot stage for a Fortune 50 company implementation nationwide. The introduction of new products is yet another example of our solid track record of introducing new technologies and reliably satisfying our customers. \n\n“Finally, I am pleased to announce our new CFO, Kevin Royal, and our newly elected board director, Mark Leposky. They both bring depth of experience successfully building high growth businesses. They are both key resources to achieve our strategy of scaling our business with top tier customers.” \n\n**Q3’24 Financial Results**\n\n**Revenue** for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 decreased 4% to $14.5 million compared to $15.1 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, due to lower capital spending in the market sectors that we serve resulting in shipments of fewer units during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, partially offset by price increases for certain energy storage units. \n\n**Gross profit** for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 decreased 7% to $4.4 million compared to a gross profit of $4.7 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2023. Gross margin decreased to 30% in the fiscal third quarter of 2024 as compared to 31% in the fiscal third quarter of 2023. Gross profit margin decreased nominally by 100 basis points as a result of higher warranty expense during the current quarter, partially offset by lower average cost of sales per unit achieved during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as a result of our product cost improvement initiatives. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA loss** was $1.4 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2024 as compared to a loss of $0.7 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, primarily attributable to the impact of lower revenue. \n\n**Selling & Administrative **expenses increased to $5.3 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2024, as compared to $4.7 million in fiscal third quarter of 2023, primarily attributable to higher staff related expenses including certain severance expenses and increases in stock-based compensation, recruiting expenses, outbound shipping costs, and professional service fees, partially offset by decreases in sales commissions, D&O insurance expenses, travel expenses, and depreciation expense. \n\n**Research & Development **expenses increased to $1.3 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.2 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher staff related expenses including severance expenses, stock-based compensation, and general research and development costs, partially offset by a decrease in equipment rental fees. \n\n**Net loss** for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 was $2.6 million, compared to a loss of $1.4 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, primarily attributable to decreased gross profit, and increases in operating expenses and interest expense to support our planned growth. \n\n**Cash** was $1.3 million on March 31, 2024, as compared to $2.4 million at June 30, 2023, reflecting changes in working capital management. Available working capital includes: our line of credit as of May 6, 2024, under our $16.0 million credit facility from Gibraltar Business Capital, or Gibraltar, with a remaining available balance of $3.2 million subject to borrowing base limitations and satisfaction of certain financial covenants; and $2.0 million available under the subordinated line of credit with Cleveland Capital. Credit line with Gibraltar, subject to eligible accounts receivables and inventory borrowing base, provides for expansion up to $20 million. An event of default has occurred under the loan agreement associated with certain EBITDA requirements that were not achieved for the three month period ended April 30, 2024. A waiver of such default was obtained and we are working with Gibraltar to modify the financial covenants in the loan agreement to prevent future defaults. In conjunction with additional time required to address the covenant development, we anticipate filing the related 10-Q on Monday, May 13, 2024. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to meet order projections, ship open sales orders, further improve our margins, reduce operating costs and raise additional capital, if needed, on a timely basis until such time as revenues and related cash flows are sufficient to fund its operations. \n\n**Net cash used in operating activities** decreased by $0.9 million to $4.3 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $5.2 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2023. \n\n**Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Results Conference Call**\n\nFlux Power CEO Ron Dutt and CFO Kevin Royal will host the conference call, followed by a question-and-answer session.

Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Other companies may use different non-GAAP measures and presentation of results. \n\nIn addition to financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release presents adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA is determined by taking net loss and adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expenses. The company believes that this non-GAAP measure, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of net loss, provides additional information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results. This metric is an integral part of the Company’s internal reporting to evaluate its operations and the performance of senior management. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, is available in the accompanying financial tables below. The non-GAAP measure presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. \n\n**US-GAAP NET INCOME (LOSS) TO ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION**  \n---  \n(Unaudited)   \n**Three Months Ended March 31,** |  **Nine Months Ended March 31,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet loss  |  $  |  (2,640,000  |  )  |  $  |  (1,445,000  |  )  |  $  |  (5,566,000  |  )  |  $  |  (5,265,000  |  )   \nAdd/Subtract:   \nInterest, net  |  433,000  |  258,000  |  1,285,000  |  971,000   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  264,000  |  276,000  |  787,000  |  647,000   \nEBITDA  |  (1,943,000  |  )  |  (911,000  |  )  |  (3,494,000  |  )  |  (3,647,000  |  )   \nAdd/Subtract:   \nStock-based compensation  |  563,000  |  235,000  |  1,233,000  |  539,000   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  (1,380,000  |  )  |  $  |  (676,000  |  )  |  $  |  (2,261,000  |  )  |  $  |  (3,108,000  |  )   \n  \n**About Flux Power Holdings, Inc.**\n\nFlux Power (NASDAQ: FLUX) designs, manufactures, and sells advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions for electrification of a range of industrial and commercial sectors including material handling, airport ground support equipment (GSE), and stationary energy storage.
