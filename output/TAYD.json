Sopko, Chief Executive Officer\nTAYLOR DEVICES, INC.\nS A L E S\nGROWING OUR PORTFOLIO\n‚Äú\n‚Äú\nAerospace and Defense...sales have jumped to $26.7M in this\nproduct line, up from $15.6M in FY23. Since FY22, sales have\nmore than doubled, and for FY24, this constitutes nearly 60% of\nour total sales.\nDear Shareholders,\nAs demonstrated by the year-end numbers, the Company continues on its plan for profitable\ngrowth. Although we had a dip in total bookings year-on-year ($45.2M in FY24 vs. $49.1 in FY23),\nwe did start FY25 with a record backlog of $33.1M. The bookings include $3.7M for Industrial\nProducts, $14.8M for Structural Products and $26.7M for Aerospace & Defense Products.\nInteresting to note is that over the last year or so, the Company has enjoyed a substantial increase\nin the sales of aerospace and defense products in terms of both total sales and in percentage of\ntotal sales as compared to structural and industrial products. Indeed, sales have jumped to $26.7M in\nthis product line, up from $15.6M in FY23. Since FY22, sales have more than doubled, and for FY24,\nthis constitutes nearly 60% of our total sales. Recent history has shown that this product line had been generating about\n40% of total sales. As usual within this sector, and as I stated in last year‚Äôs annual report, we continue to support many\nmature programs while being awarded several new development programs by new and legacy customers that we hope will\nprovide sustained revenue for years to come. Additionally, our strategy for generating new sales and continuing to attack\nstrategic programs will help this trend to continue. Personally, it is quite satisfying for me to see that products that we\ndeveloped back in the 1980‚Äôs when I was a young engineer are still generating significant business for the Company today.\nFeatured in this annual report is a large project that we recently completed at 651 Gateway in San Francisco, CA. This\nwas a voluntary seismic upgrade to a 300,000 square foot, 17 story building that was built in the late 1980‚Äôs. The upgrade\nconverted its previous standard office space to Class A lab space. Taylor Devices provided a total of 127 viscous dampers\nthat were placed in a staggered pattern throughout the height of the building. As shown in the pictures, the dampers are\nquite visible to occupants and passers-by alike as the building has a glass facade and the dampers are not hidden behind\ndrywall. Please enjoy the pictures as the dampers show quite well!\nAs Taylor Devices is now in its 70th year, we thought it would be interesting to feature some content from old annual reports\nto exemplify how the Company has changed over so many years. Back in 1962, the Company had sales of $334K and a net\nloss of $77K. Then, in 1964, we had sales of $537K and lost $166K. By 1991, we recorded a net profit of $52K on sales of\n$4.4M. Throughout our history of growth, there sure were some lean years that we struggled through, but perseverance and\nhard work paid off. We sure have come a long way!\nAs we are continuing to have a physical AGM, please join us at the meeting in Amherst, NY in October where we will be\npresenting some of the great progress that continues at both our campuses in North Tonawanda, NY.\nSincerely,\nAlan Klembczyk, President\nTAYLOR DEVICES, INC.\nREFLECTING ON OUR\nPAST\nLOOKING TOWARD OUR\nFUTURE\nAS WE HEAD INTO OUR 70TH YEAR OF BUSINESS\nClipped from the Taylor Devices\n1964 Annual Report, this page\nshowcases some of our products\nand projects we were working\non at the time. Manufacturing,\ntransportation including the\nrailroad industry, aerospace,\nelectronics, and even nuclear\nreactors were some of the\nmain markets for the Company.\nCustomers included Vought,\nPratt & Whitney, Sikorsky, the\nU.S. Navy, Sperry, NASA, and\nmany more. It wasn‚Äôt until\nthe 1990s, that our dampers\nwere developed for structural\napplications. 60 years later,\nsome of these remain among\nour most valued customers\ntoday!\nFrom the 1964 Annual Report:\n‚ÄúMost companies\nhave one product and\ndiversify through external\nacquisition. Taylor has\nan entry in the markets\nnoted. Acceptance has\nbeen difficult and costly,\nbut each of these markets\nin itself could create a\nsubstantial corporation.‚Äù\nF E A T U R E D P R O J E C T\n665511 GGaatteewwaayy\ns o u t h s a n f r a n c i s c o , c a\nUpgrading this structure from standard office space\nSize 300,000 sqft\nto Class A lab space provided a unique opportunity\nStories 17 to include a voluntary seismic upgrade along\nBuilding Type Commercial with MEP and Architectural improvements. The\nstructure, built in the late 1980s, uses both Eccentric\nNumber of Dampers 127\nBraced Frames and perimeter Pre-Northridge\nStructural Engineer IMEG & Maffei\nMoment Frames as the lateral systems, both of\nGeneral Contractor Truebeck Construction\nwhich contained deficiencies common to those\nOwner Boston Properties\nconstruction eras. Dampers reduced the story drifts\nsignificantly, addressing a soft story mechanism\nand reducing beam-column rotations to eliminate\nany connection or foundation upgrades. Dampers\nwere placed in a staggered pattern up the height of\nthe building to reduce the accumulation of force in\nany given location.\nO P E R A T I O N S\nCONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING\n‚Äú\n‚Äú\nThe entire Taylor Team pulled together to achieve these\nresults, enabled by better systems, processes, and training.\nDear Shareholders,\nThe Taylor Devices Operational Excellence Journey has improved year over year and continued into\nFY24. To start, we have accomplished $44.6m in assembled, tested, and shipped revenue, which\nis a Taylor record and an 11% increase from FY23. We have also achieved a customer order on-\ntime delivery of 92%, which is another Taylor record and a 3% improvement from FY23. Not only\nare we improving on our deliveries, but also making sure past due orders are completed quickly.\nOur past due order lines dropped to a monthly average of 8, which is a 10% reduction from the FY23\nmonthly average. Finally, we are making our facilities safer for our employees. We have reduced our\nnumber of safety incidents/injuries; CY24 is on pace for 30% fewer incidents/injuries from CY23.\nThe entire Taylor Team pulled together to achieve these results, enabled by better systems, processes, and training. Our\nContinuous Improvement Program underpins our journey to improve all aspects of our business through various projects\naccomplished by our team in FY24.\nMany of these projects allowed us to become even more lean and efficient in many of our day-to-day operations. For example,\nin our machine shop, we have completed dozens of machining setup and run time improvements, reducing job machining\ntime by 10-50%. Our Superfinisher is fully operational, saving 50% of labor time per finished rod. When it comes to assembly,\nour Structural Baseplate Assembly process improved via material handling equipment leading to a safer and more efficient\nprocess. After our products are assembled, our new Easy Arm crane with lift assist, which was installed on a Structural\nProduct Test Machine, provides a safer and more efficient process. We are adding new technology to our facilities including a\nnew 3D printer which was operationalized, resulting in improvement in the speed and quality of prints.\nAlong with becoming more efficient, we are also focused on reducing our carbon footprint. We have hired our first-ever full-\ntime Environmental, Health, & Safety (EHS) resource to help us improve our environmental management system. With that,\nwe have begun using reusable/recyclable packaging solutions developed for transporting parts to and from Outside Service\nVendors. In our machine shop, we installed a new environmentally friendly, water-based aqueous parts washer for in-process\ncleaning and a new evaporator which reduced energy costs for that process by 50%. In an effort to improve delivery and\nreduce costs, we joined a shipping consortium, resulting in a 25% reduction in targeted shipping costs.\nFinally, many of these projects were fueled by a relentless focus to improve each and every day. Our Production Readiness\nReview/Test Readiness Review (PRR/TRR) process was piloted and rolled out, proactively preventing assembly and test\nissues on new products. We have completed numerous 5S Events, all leading to a safer and more efficient process in the\nMedium Lathe work center, Head Cell, and Drop Test area. A High Energy Safety Team (HEST) was formed to examine and\napprove modifications and additions to high-energy test equipment. We are well positioned to support Taylor Devices‚Äô future\nprofitable growth plan, to the delight of our Shareholders, our Customers, and our team members.\nSincerely,\nTodd Avery, Vice President of Operations\nTAYLOR DEVICES, INC.\nWe have achieved\nan all-time high 92%\non-time delivery.\nOur Fiscal\nYear 2024 Operational\nResults were underpinned\nby a relentless focus on a\nWe have new unique combination of projects\nmachinery to reduce\nthat support our Company‚Äôs\nenergy and become\nmore efficient. long-range strategic plan and\nan engaged workforce that is\ncommitted to our Customers\nand each other.\nWe have improved\nmachining setup to\nreduce run-times and\nsave costs.\nEric Roth using the new Easy Arm crane in one\nof our testing machines.\nUNMATCHED TESTING\nCAPABILITIES\nBesides manufacturing exceptional products for energy\nmanagement, one of the major capabilities we take great\npride in is our testing abilities. Testing has always been\nimportant to us here at Taylor Devices, and a vital part of\nour operations since opening in 1955.\nToday, we have developed world-class facilities comprised\nof 12 separate test systems including vertical drop\nrails, hydraulic actuators for dynamic testing, and static\nhydraulic test stands. These test machines are capable\nof forces up to 4,000,000 lbs. and velocities of 600 in/sec\nand provide acceptance and qualification testing on our\nproducts according to strict customer requirements.\nThis photo was taken from our 1963 Annual Report\nand shows a shock test being performed on a shock\nabsorber before being shipped to a customer.\nF I N A N C I A L S\nSTRENGTH IN THE NUMBERS\n‚Äú\n‚Äú\nFiscal year 2024 financial performance continued to\ntrend favorably. Revenue increased 11% over fiscal year\n2023 with heavier concentration of Aerospace sales...\nDear Shareholders,\nFiscal year 2024 (FY24) financial performance continued to trend favorably. Revenue increased\n11% over fiscal year 2023 (FY23) with a heavier concentration of Aerospace sales which were\nup 71% from the prior year. Accordingly, domestic sales as a percentage of total increased to\n86% versus 81% in FY23. The year-end backlog position is up 2% from May 2023 and is weighted\ntowards aerospace/defense customers at 72% versus 28% for commercial customers.\nGross Profit, which increased to $20.8 million, or 47% of sales, from $16.9 million or 42% of sales in\nFY23, was favorably impacted by both Price and Cost actions. Management of costs has been facilitated\nby recent investments in manufacturing capability. FY24 capital expenditures of $1.1 million continued to be focused on\nmachinery and equipment upgrades. Research and Development costs decreased to $0.4 million with the conclusion of the\nTaylor Damped Moment Frame‚Ñ¢ project. Engineering resources pivoted to support more funded research and development,\nwhich increased 50% from FY23.\nAs a result of all the above, Net Income finished at $9.0 million, or 20% of sales, versus the prior year at $6.3 million or 16% of\nsales. Earnings per share went up to $2.68 as compared to $1.79 in FY23.\nThe sales order backlog of $33.1 million as of May 31, 2024, along with increasing customer funded development activity,\nprovides a good launch point into the future. Our Balance Sheet remains strong and will allow us to continue making\ninvestments that support sustained profitable growth.\nSincerely,\nPaul Heary, Chief Financial Officer\nTAYLOR DEVICES, INC.\n$2.68\nEarnings per share went up to as compared to $1.79 in FY23.\nMARKET INFORMATION\nFISCAL YEAR 2023 FISCAL YEAR 2024\nHIGH $61.70\nHIGH $37.50\nHIGH $26.40 LOW $33.70\nHIGH $23.79 HIGH $23.90\nHIGH $16.98\nHIGH $14.00 LOW $19.81 LOW $21.98\nLOW $18.06\nHIGH $10.25 LOW $15.30\nLOW $9.66 LOW $10.50\nLOW $8.13\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\nStock price highs and lows for the past two fiscal years.\nCUSTOMER GROUPS CUSTOMER LOCATIONS\nAEROSPACE / DEFENSE 60% USA 86%\nSTRUCTURAL 32% OTHER 10%\nINDUSTRIAL 8% ASIA 4%\n8% 10%\n4%\n2024 2024\n32% 10% 8%\n11%\n60%\n39%\n2023 2023\n86%\n51%\n81%\nBack in 1962, the Company had\nsales of $334K and a net loss\nof $77K.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCautionary Statement\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \"safe harbor\" for forward-looking statements. Information in this\nItem 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and elsewhere in this Form 10-\nK that does not consist of historical facts are \"forward-looking statements.\" Statements accompanied or qualified by, or containing,\nwords such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\"\n\"outlook,\" \"forecast,\" \"anticipates,\" \"presume,\" \"assume\" and \"optimistic\" constitute forward-looking statements and, as such, are\nnot a guarantee of future performance. These statements involve factors, risks and uncertainties, the impact or occurrence of which\ncan cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in such statements. Risks and uncertainties can\ninclude, among others: fluctuations in general business cycles and changing economic conditions; variations in timing and amount\nof customer orders; changing product demand and industry capacity; increased competition and pricing pressures; advances in\ntechnology that can reduce the demand for the Company's products, as well as other factors, many or all of which may be beyond\nthe Company's control. Consequently, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as predictive of\nfuture results. Except as required by law, the Company disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to the\nforward-looking statements herein to reflect any change in the Company's expectations with regard thereto, or any changes in\nevents, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles. The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions\nand judgments that affect the amounts reported. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are affected by management's\napplication of accounting policies, which are discussed in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\", and elsewhere in\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements. As discussed below, our financial position or results of operations may be\nmaterially affected when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.\nIn the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to\nreflect more current information. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant\njudgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements.\nAccounts Receivable\nOur ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows. Accounts\nreceivable are stated at an amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for probable\nuncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the current\nstatus of individual accounts after considering the age of each receivable and communications with the customers involved.\nBalances that are collected, for which a credit to a valuation allowance had previously been recorded, result in a current-period\nreversal of the earlier transaction charging earnings and crediting a valuation allowance. Balances that are still outstanding after\nmanagement has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to\naccounts receivable in the current period. The actual amount of accounts written off over the five year period ended May 31, 2024\nequaled 0.2% of sales for that period. The balance of the valuation allowance is unchanged at $29,000 at both May 31, 2024 and\nMay 31, 2023. Management does not expect the valuation allowance to materially change in the next twelve months for the current\naccounts receivable balance.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Average cost approximates first-in, first-out cost.\nMaintenance and other inventory represent stock that is estimated to have a product life-cycle in excess of twelve-months. This\nstock represents certain items the Company is required to maintain for service of products sold, and items that are generally subject\nto spontaneous ordering.\nThis inventory is particularly sensitive to technical obsolescence in the near term due to its use in industries characterized by the\ncontinuous introduction of new product lines, rapid technological advances, and product obsolescence. Therefore, management of\nthe Company has recorded an allowance for potential inventory obsolescence. Based on certain assumptions and judgments made\nfrom the information available at that time, we determine the amount in the inventory allowance. If these estimates and related\nassumptions or the market changes, we may be required to record additional reserves. Historically, actual results have not varied\nmaterially from the Company's estimates. There was $791,000 and $322,000 of inventory disposed of during the years ended May\n31, 2024 and 2023. The provision for potential inventory obsolescence was $386,000 and $295,000 for the years ended May 31,\n2024 and 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, the Company transfers control of promised products or services to a customer in an amount that\nreflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account.\nA contract‚Äôs transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the\nperformance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer\nthe individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts which are, therefore, not distinct.\nPromised goods or services that are immaterial in the context of the contract are not separately assessed as performance obligations.\nFor contracts with customers in which the Company satisfies a promise to the customer to provide a product that has no alternative\nuse to the Company and the Company has enforceable rights to payment for progress completed to date inclusive of profit, the\nCompany satisfies the performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time (generally less than one year), using costs incurred\nto date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred\ncost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract\ncosts include labor, material and overhead. Total estimated costs for each of the contracts are estimated based on a combination of\nhistorical costs of manufacturing similar products and estimates or quotes from vendors for supplying parts or services towards the\ncompletion of the manufacturing process. Adjustments to cost and profit estimates are made periodically due to changes in job\nperformance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements. These changes may\nresult in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Any losses expected\nto be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined. If total costs calculated\nupon completion of the manufacturing process in the current period for a contract are more than the estimated total costs at\ncompletion used to calculate revenue in a prior period, then the profits in the current period will be lower than if the estimated costs\nused in the prior period calculation were equal to the actual total costs upon completion. Historically, actual results have not varied\nmaterially from the Company's estimates. Other sales to customers are recognized upon shipment to the customer based on contract\nprices and terms. In the year ended May 31, 2024, 59% of revenue was recorded for contracts in which revenue was recognized\nover time while 41% was recognized at a point in time. In the year ended May 31, 2023, 61% of revenue was recorded for contracts\nin which revenue was recognized over time while 39% was recognized at a point in time.\nFor financial statement presentation purposes, the Company nets progress billings against the total costs incurred and estimated\nearnings on uncompleted contracts. The asset, \"costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings,\" represents revenues recognized\nin excess of amounts billed. The liability, \"billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings,\" represents billings in excess of\nrevenues recognized.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes provides for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements regardless of when\nsuch taxes are payable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary\ndifferences between the tax and financial statement basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets relate principally to asset\nvaluation allowances such as inventory obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves and also to liabilities including warranty\nreserves, accrued vacation, accrued commissions and others. The deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to differences between\nfinancial statement and tax depreciation. Deferred taxes are based on tax laws currently enacted with tax rates expected to be in\neffect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nRealization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income at the time temporary differences become\ndeductible. The Company provides a valuation allowance to the extent that deferred tax assets may not be realized. A valuation\nallowance has not been recorded against the deferred tax assets since management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred\ntax assets are recoverable. The Company considers future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need\nfor a potential valuation allowance. In future years the Company will need to generate approximately $10.4 million of taxable\nincome in order to realize our deferred tax assets recorded as of May 31, 2024 of $2,176,000. This deferred tax asset balance is\n38% ($594,000) higher than at the end of the prior year. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however, could\nbe reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. If actual results differ from estimated results or if the\nCompany adjusts these assumptions, the Company may need to adjust its deferred tax assets or liabilities, which could impact its\neffective tax rate.\nThe Company's practice is to recognize interest related to income tax matters in interest income / expense and to recognize penalties\nin selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe Company and its subsidiary file consolidated federal and state income tax returns. As of May 31, 2024, the Company had state\ninvestment tax credit carryforwards of approximately $470,000 expiring through May 2029.\nResults of Operations\nA summary of the period-to-period changes in the principal items included in the consolidated statements of income is shown\nbelow:\nSummary comparison of the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023\nIncrease /\n(Decrease)\nSales, net $ 4,384,000\nCost of goods sold $ 494,000\nResearch and development costs $ (708,000)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 1,928,000\nOther income (expense) $ 745,000\nIncome before provision for income taxes $ 3,415,000\nProvision for income taxes $ 704,000\nNet income $ 2,711,000\nFor the year ended May 31, 2024 (All figures being discussed are for the year ended May 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended\nMay 31, 2023.)\nYear ended May 31 Change\n2024 2023 Amount Percent\nNet Revenue $ 44,583,000 $ 40,199,000 $ 4,384,000 11%\nCost of sales 23,744,000 23,250,000 494,000 2%\nGross profit $ 20,839,000 $ 16,949,000 $ 3,890,000 23%\n‚Ä¶ as a percentage of net revenues 47% 42%\nThe Company's consolidated results of operations showed an 11% increase in net revenues and an increase in net income of 43%.\nRevenues recorded in the year ended May 31, 2024 for long-term projects (‚ÄúProject(s)‚Äù) were 8% higher than the level recorded in\nthe prior year. We had 39 Projects in process during the year ended May 31, 2024 compared with 52 during the same period last\nyear. Revenues recorded in the year ended May 31, 2024 for other-than long-term projects (non-projects) were 15% higher than\nthe level recorded in the prior year. The number of Projects in-process fluctuates from period to period. The changes from the\nprior year to the year ended May 31, 2024 are not necessarily representative of future results.\nSales of the Company's products are made to three general groups of customers: industrial, structural and aerospace / defense. The\nCompany saw a 30% decrease from last year‚Äôs level in sales to structural customers who were seeking seismic / wind protection for\neither construction of new buildings and bridges or retrofitting existing buildings and bridges along with a 71% increase in sales to\ncustomers in aerospace / defense and a 12% decrease in sales to customers using our products in industrial applications.\nA breakdown of sales to these three general groups of customers, as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal years ended May\n31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nYear ended May 31\n2024 2023\nIndustrial 8% 10%\nStructural 32% 51%\nAerospace / Defense 60% 39%\nTotal sales within the U.S. increased 18% from last year. Total sales to Asia decreased 55% from the prior year. Net revenue by\ngeographic region, as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nYear ended May 31\n2024 2023\nU.S. 86% 81%\nAsia 4% 11%\nOther 10% 8%\nThe gross profit as a percentage of net revenue of 47% in the year ended May 31, 2024 is five percentage points greater than the\nsame period of the prior year (42%). The Company has been able to increase sales prices to recover more of the increased costs for\nmaterials and labor that were incurred during the year ended May 31, 2024. Management continues to work with suppliers to obtain\nmore visibility of conditions affecting their respective markets. These actions combined with benefits from the Company‚Äôs\ncontinuous improvement initiatives and increased volume have helped to improve the gross margin as a percentage of revenue over\nthe prior year.\nAt May 31, 2024, we had 134 open sales orders in our backlog with a total sales value of $33.1 million. At May 31, 2023, we had\n134 open sales orders in our backlog with a total sales value of $32.5 million. $18.6 million of the current backlog is on Projects\nalready in progress. $18.1 million of the $32.5 million sales order backlog at May 31, 2023 was in progress at that date. 72% of the\nsales value in the backlog is for aerospace / defense customers compared to 74% at the end of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of the\ntotal sales order backlog, orders from structural customers accounted for 22% at May 31, 2024 and 22% at May 31, 2023. The\nCompany expects to recognize revenue for the majority of the backlog during the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025, with the\nremainder during the fiscal year ending May 31, 2026.\nThe Company's backlog, revenues, commission expense, gross margins, gross profits, and net income fluctuate from period to\nperiod. Total sales in the current period and the changes in the current period compared to the prior period, are not necessarily\nrepresentative of future results.\nResearch and Development Costs\nYears ended May 31 Change\n2024 2023 Amount Percent\nR & D $ 388,000 $ 1,097,000 $ (709,000) -65%\n‚Ä¶ as a percentage of net revenues 0.9% 2.7%\nResearch and development costs decreased 65% from the prior year.

The increase in operating income was attributed to the decrease in research and development costs as well\nas improved gross margin performance.\nOther Income (expense)\nOther income increased 104% from the prior year due to increased interest income from higher levels of short-term investments\nduring the course of the year.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate (ETR) is calculated based upon current assumptions relating to the year's operating results and\nvarious tax related items. The ETR for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 is 18%, compared to the ETR for the prior year of 16%.\nA reconciliation of provision for income taxes at the statutory rate to income tax provision at the Company's effective rate is as\nfollows:\n2024 2023\nComputed tax provision at the expected statutory rate $ 2,293,000 $ 1,575,000\nTax effect of permanent differences:\nResearch tax credits (408,000) (284,000)\nForeign-derived intangible income deduction (142,000) (67,000)\nStock option costs 49,000 -\nOther permanent differences 3,000 1,000\nOther 127,000 (7,000)\n$ 1,922,000 $ 1,218,000\nThe foreign-derived intangible income deduction is a tax deduction provided to corporations that sell goods or services to foreign\ncustomers. It became available through Public Law 115-97, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources, Line of Credit and Long-Term Debt\nThe Company's primary liquidity requirements depend on its working capital and capital expenditure needs. Working capital\nconsists primarily of cash and short-term investments, inventory, accounts receivable, costs and estimated earnings in excess of\nbillings, accounts payable, accrued expenses and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. The Company's primary source\nof liquidity has been excess cash flow from operations.\nCapital expenditures for the year ended May 31, 2024 were $1,149,000 compared to $3,359,000 in the prior year. The Company\nalso acquired Pumpkin‚Ñ¢ Mounts intellectual property during the year ended May 31, 2024 for $300,000. Current year capital\nexpenditures included new manufacturing machinery, testing equipment, upgrades to technology equipment and assembly / test\nfacility improvements. The Company has commitments to make capital expenditures of approximately $1,360,000 as of May 31,\n2024. These capital expenditures will be primarily for new manufacturing and testing equipment.\nOn January 4, 2024, the Company entered into a redemption agreement to purchase 459,015 of the Company‚Äôs shares of the capital\nstock of the Company, which represented approximately 13% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the\nCompany as of January 8, 2024 (the ‚ÄúClosing Date‚Äù), from the Ira Sochet Trust and the Ira Sochet Roth IRA. Each of the foregoing\ncounterparties are non-affiliates of the Company. The agreed purchase price was $19.92 per share, which constituted 87.6% of the\naverage price ($22.74) at which shares of the Company's common stock traded on the Closing Date.\nThe Company has a $10,000,000 demand line of credit with M&T Bank, with interest payable at the Company's option of 30, 60\nor 90 day SOFR rate plus 2.365%. There is no outstanding balance at May 31, 2024. The line is secured by a negative pledge of\nthe Company's real and personal property and is subject to renewal annually. The bank is not committed to make loans under this\nline of credit and no commitment fee is charged.\nManagement believes that the Company's cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and borrowing capacity under the bank line\nof credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations and capital improvements for the next twelve months.\nInventory and Maintenance Inventory\nMay 31, 2024 May 31, 2023 Increase /(Decrease)\nRaw materials $ 887,000 $ 674,000 $ 213,000 32%\nWork-in-process 6,412,000 5,005,000 1,407,000 28%\nFinished goods 213,000 262,000 (49,000) -19%\nInventory 7,512,000 83% 5,941,000 86% 1,571,000 26%\nMaintenance and other inventory 1,580,000 17% 1,003,000 14% 577,000 58%\nTotal $ 9,092,000 100% $ 6,944,000 100% $ 2,148,000 31%\nInventory turnover 3.0 3.5\nInventory, at $7,512,000 as of May 31, 2024, is 26 percent higher than at the prior year-end. Of this, approximately 85% is work\nin process, 3% is finished goods, and 12% is raw materials. All of the current inventory is expected to be consumed or sold within\ntwelve months. The level of inventory will fluctuate from time to time due to the stage of completion of the non-project sales orders\nin progress at the time.\nThe Company disposed of approximately $791,000 and $322,000 of obsolete inventory during the years ended May 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable, Costs and Estimated Earnings in Excess of Billings (‚ÄúCIEB‚Äù) and Billings in Excess of Costs and\nEstimated Earnings (‚ÄúBIEC‚Äù)\nMay 31, 2024 May 31, 2023 Increase /(Decrease)\nAccounts receivable 5,212,000 5,554,000 (342,000) -6%\nCIEB 4,357,000 4,124,000 233,000 6%\nLess: BIEC 5,601,000 1,992,000 3,609,000 181%\nNet $ 3,968,000 $ 7,686,000 $ (3,718,000) -48%\nNumber of an average day‚Äôs sales outstanding in\naccounts receivable (DSO) 39 47\nThe Company combines the totals of accounts receivable, the asset CIEB, and the liability BIEC, to determine how much cash the\nCompany will eventually realize from revenue recorded to date. As the accounts receivable figure rises in relation to the other two\nfigures, the Company can anticipate increased cash receipts within the ensuing 30-60 days.\nAccounts receivable of $5,212,000 as of May 31, 2024 includes no retainage by customers on long-term construction projects. The\nnumber of an average day's sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) was 39 days at May 31, 2024 and 47 days at May 31,\n2023. The Company expects to collect the net accounts receivable balance during the next twelve months.\nThe status of the projects in-progress at the end of the current and prior fiscal years have changed in the factors affecting the year-\nend balances in the asset CIEB, and the liability BIEC:\n2024 2023\nNumber of projects in progress at year-end 19 22\nAggregate percent complete at year-end 53% 33%\nAverage total value of projects in progress at year-end $2,089,000 $1,285,000\nPercentage of total value invoiced to customer 56% 29%\nThere are three less projects in-process at the end of the current fiscal year as compared with the prior year end and the average\nvalue of those projects has increased by 63% between those two dates.\nAs noted above, CIEB represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. Whenever possible, the Company negotiates a\nprovision in sales contracts to allow the Company to bill, and collect from the customer, payments in advance of shipments.\nUnfortunately, provisions such as this are often not possible. The $4,357,000 balance in this account at May 31, 2024 is a 6%\nincrease from the prior year-end. This increase reflects the higher aggregate level of the percentage of completion of these Projects\nas of the current year end as compared with the Projects in process at the prior year end. Generally, if progress billings are permitted\nunder the terms of a project sales agreement, then the more complete the project is, the more progress billings will be permitted.\nThe Company expects to bill the entire amount during the next twelve months. 58% of the CIEB balance as of the end of the last\nfiscal quarter, February 29, 2024, was billed to those customers in the current fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2024. The remainder\nwill be billed as the projects progress, in accordance with the terms specified in the various contracts.\nThe year-end balances in the CIEB account are comprised of the following components:\nMay 31, 2024 May 31, 2023\nCosts $ 9,644,000 $ 3,006,000\nEstimated earnings 9,782,000 2,648,000\nLess: Billings to customers 15,069,000 1,530,000\nCIEB $ 4,357,000 $ 4,124,000\nNumber of projects in progress 14 12\nAs noted above, BIEC represents billings to customers in excess of revenues recognized. The $5,601,000 balance in this account\nat May 31, 2024 is in comparison to a $1,992,000 balance at the end of the prior year. The balance in this account fluctuates in the\nsame manner and for the same reasons as the account \"costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings,\" discussed above. Final\ndelivery of product under these contracts is expected to occur during the next twelve months.\nThe year-end balances in this account are comprised of the following components:\nMay 31, 2024 May 31, 2023\nBillings to customers $ 7,211,000 $ 6,538,000\nLess: Costs 933,000 2,343,000\nLess: Estimated earnings 677,000 2,203,000\nBIEC $ 5,601,000 $ 1,992,000\nNumber of projects in progress 5 10\nAccounts payable, at $1,439,000 as of May 31, 2024, is 16% less than the prior year-end. This decrease is normal fluctuation of\nthis account and is not considered to be unusual. The Company expects the current accounts payable amount to be paid during the\nnext twelve months.\nAccrued expenses of $4,664,000 increased 14% from the prior year level of $4,078,000. This change is due to increases in accrued\nincentive compensation resulting from increased earnings.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders\nTaylor Devices, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Taylor Devices, Inc. and Subsidiary (the\nCompany) as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity,\nand cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively\nreferred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of the Company as of May 31, 2024and 2023, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company‚Äôs management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the currentperiod audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nCost Estimates for Long-Term Contracts and Related Revenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter\nAs more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over\ntime for long-term contracts as goods are produced. The Company uses costs incurred as the method to determine\nprogress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The\nprocess of estimating margin at completion involves estimating the costs to complete production of goods and\ncomparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Long-term contracts are inherently uncertain in that\nrevenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant\nvariability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these contracts, changes to cost estimates\ncould occur, resulting in higher or lower marginswhen the contracts are completed.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing\nthese estimates involved a focused audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nOur auditing procedures related to the cost estimates for long-term contracts and related revenue recognition\nincluded the following, among others:\nÔÇ∑ We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management‚Äôs methods used todevelop its estimates.\nÔÇ∑ We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management\nrelating to key estimates.\nÔÇ∑ We selected a sample of executed contracts to understand the contract, perform an independent assessment\nof the appropriate timing of revenue recognition, and test the mathematical accuracy of revenue recognized\nbased on costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion.\nÔÇ∑ We performed inquiries of the Company‚Äôs project managers and others directly involved with the contracts\nto evaluate project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We\nalso observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the\nproject.\nÔÇ∑ We tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used to develop key estimates, including material,\nlabor, overhead, and sub-contractor costs.\nÔÇ∑ We performed retrospective reviews of prior year long-term contracts, comparing actual performance to\nestimated performance and the related financial statement impact, when evaluating the thoroughness and\nprecision of management‚Äôs estimation processin previous years.\nValuation of Inventory\nDescription of the Matter\nAs of May 31, 2024, the Company‚Äôs inventory balance was $7.5 million, net of a $59,000 allowance for\nobsolescence, its maintenance and other inventory balance was $1.6 million, net of an approximate $837,000\nallowance for obsolescence. As discussed in Note 5, maintenance and other inventory represents certain items that\nare estimated to have a product life-cycle in excess of twelve months the Company is required to maintain for\nservice of products sold and items that are generally subject to spontaneous ordering. The Company evaluates its\ninventory for obsolescence on an ongoing basis by considering historical usage as well as requirements for future\norders.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty and significant judgments necessary to estimate potential inventory obsolescence,\nauditing management‚Äôsestimates involved a high degree of auditor judgment.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nOur auditing procedures related to valuation of inventory included the following, among others:\nÔÇ∑ We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management‚Äôs methods used to develop its estimates.\nÔÇ∑ We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management\nrelating to key estimates.\nÔÇ∑ We inquired of management relative to write-offs of inventory during the year.\nÔÇ∑ We tested the completeness and accuracy of management‚Äôs schedule ofinventory.\nÔÇ∑ We developed an independent expectation of the obsolescence reserve based on our knowledge of the\nCompany‚Äôs inventory, including analysis of slow-moving items and historical usage and compared it to\nactual.\nÔÇ∑ We examined management‚Äôs lower of cost or net realizable value analysis and performed procedures to test\nits completeness and accuracy.\nÔÇ∑ We selected a sample ofmaterial purchases made during the year to ensure they were included in inventory\nat the proper value.\nÔÇ∑ During our physical inventory observation, we toured the Company‚Äôs warehouses and examined inventory\non hand for any indications of obsolescence.\nWe have served as the Company‚Äôs auditor since 1998.\nBuffalo, New York\nAugust 15, 2024\nTAYLOR DEVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nNature of Operations:\nTaylor Devices, Inc. (the Company) manufactures and sells a single group of very similar products that have many different\napplications for customers. These similar products are included in one of nine categories; namely, Seismic Dampers,\nFluidicshoks¬Æ, Crane and Industrial Buffers, Self-Adjusting Shock Absorbers, Liquid Die Springs, Vibration Dampers, Machined\nSprings, Custom Shock and Vibration Isolators, and Custom Actuators for use in various types of machinery, equipment and\nstructures, primarily to customers which are located throughout the United States and several foreign countries. The products are\nmanufactured at the Company's sole operating facility in the United States where all of the Company's long-lived assets reside.\nManagement does not track or otherwise account for sales broken down by these categories.\n86% of the Company's 2024 revenue was generated from sales to customers in the United States and 4% was from sales to customers\nin Asia. Remaining sales were to customers in other countries in North America, Europe, Australia, and South America.\n81% of the Company's 2023 revenue was generated from sales to customers in the United States and 11% was from sales to\ncustomers in Asia. Remaining sales were to customers in other countries in North America, Europe, Australia, and South America.\nPrinciples of Consolidation:\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Tayco\nRealty Corporation (Realty). All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSubsequent Events:\nThe Company has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements through the\ndate the financial statements were issued.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and\naccompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nThe Company includes all highly liquid investments in money market funds in cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying\nbalance sheets.\nCash and cash equivalents in financial institutions may exceed insured limits at various times during the year and subject the\nCompany to concentrations of credit risk.\nShort-Term Investments:\nAt times, the Company invests excess funds in liquid interest earning instruments. Short-term investments at May 31, 2024 and\nMay 31, 2023 include money market funds, US treasury securities and corporate bonds stated at fair value, which approximates\ncost. The short-term investments (22) mature on various dates during the period June 2024 to December 2026. Unrealized holding\ngains and losses would be presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred income\ntaxes. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined using the specific identification method.\nThe short-term investments are valued using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities. This\nincludes basing value on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.\nAccounts and Other Receivables:\nAccounts and other receivables are stated at an amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management\nprovides for probable uncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its\nassessment of the current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable\ncollection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to the receivable.\nInventory:\nInventory is stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Average cost approximates first-in, first-out cost.\nProperty and Equipment:\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided primarily using the straight-line\nmethod for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax reporting purposes. Maintenance and repairs are\ncharged to operations as incurred; significant improvements are capitalized.\nCash Value of Life Insurance:\nCash value of life insurance is stated at the surrender value of the contracts.\nRevenue Recognition:\nRevenue is recognized (generally at fixed prices) when, or as, the Company transfers control of promised products or services to a\ncustomer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those\nproducts or services.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account.\nA contract‚Äôs transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the\nperformance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer\nthe individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts which are, therefore, not distinct.\nPromised goods or services that are immaterial in the context of the contract are not separately assessed as performance obligations.\nFor contracts with customers in which the Company satisfies a promise to the customer to provide a product that has no alternative\nuse to the Company and the Company has enforceable rights to payment for progress completed to date inclusive of profit, the\nCompany satisfies the performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time (generally less than one year), using costs incurred\nto date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred\ncost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract\ncosts include labor, material and overhead. Adjustments to cost estimates are made periodically, and losses expected to be incurred\non contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined. Other sales to customers are recognized\nupon shipment to the customer based on contract prices and terms. In the year ended May 31, 2024, 59% of revenue was recorded\nfor contracts in which revenue was recognized over time while 41% was recognized at a point in time. In the year ended May 31,\n2023, 61% of revenue was recorded for contracts in which revenue was recognized over time while 39% was recognized at a point\nin time.\nProgress payments are typically negotiated for longer term projects. Payments are otherwise due once performance obligations are\ncomplete (generally at shipment and transfer of title). For financial statement presentation purposes, the Company nets progress\nbillings against the total costs incurred on uncompleted contracts. The asset, ‚Äúcosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings,‚Äù\nrepresents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, ‚Äúbillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings,‚Äù\nrepresents billings in excess of revenues recognized.\nIf applicable, the Company recognizes an asset for the incremental material costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the\nCompany expects the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year and the costs are expected to be recovered. As of May 31,\n2024 and 2023, the Company does not have material incremental costs on any open contracts with an original expected duration of\ngreater than one year, and therefore such costs are expensed as incurred. These incremental costs include, but are not limited to,\nsales commissions incurred to obtain a contract with a customer.\nShipping and Handling Costs:\nShipping and handling costs on incoming inventory items are classified as a component of cost of goods sold, while shipping and\nhandling costs on outgoing shipments to customers are classified as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe amounts of these costs classified as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses were $190,939 and $366,763\nfor the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023. Shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of\nthe product are considered fulfillment activities, not performance obligations.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe provision for income taxes provides for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements regardless of when\nsuch taxes are payable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary\ndifferences between the tax and financial statement basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are based on tax laws currently\nenacted with tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nThe Company's practice is to recognize interest related to income tax matters in interest income / expense and to recognize penalties in\nselling, general and administrative expenses. The Company did not have any accrued interest or penalties included in its consolidated\nbalance sheets at May 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company recorded no interest expense or penalties in its consolidated statements of\nincome during the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company believes it is no longer subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities for years prior to May 31, 2021.\nSales Taxes:\nCertain jurisdictions impose a sales tax on Company sales to nonexempt customers. The Company collects these taxes from\ncustomers and remits the entire amount as required by the applicable law. The Company excludes from revenues and expenses the\ntax collected and remitted.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nThe Company measures compensation cost arising from the grant of share-based payments to employees at fair value and recognizes\nsuch cost in income over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The stock-\nbased compensation expense for the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 was $1,047,252 and $417,253.\nNew Accounting Standards:\nAny recently issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) guidance has either been implemented or is not significant to the\nCompany.\nReclassifications:\nThe 2023 financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted for 2024.\n2.

This\nstock represents certain items the Company is required to maintain for service of products sold, and items that are generally subject\nto spontaneous ordering. This inventory is particularly sensitive to technical obsolescence in the near term due to its use in industries\ncharacterized by the continuous introduction of new product lines, rapid technological advances and product obsolescence.\nTherefore, management of the Company has recorded an allowance for potential inventory obsolescence. $791,000 and $322,000\nof inventory was disposed of during the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023. The provision for potential inventory obsolescence\nwas $386,000 and $295,000 for the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023.

Sales:\nThe Company manufactures and sells a single group of very similar products that have many different applications for customers.\nThese similar products are included in one of nine categories; namely, Seismic Dampers, Fluidicshoks¬Æ, Crane and Industrial\nBuffers, Self-Adjusting Shock Absorbers, Liquid Die Springs, Vibration Dampers, Machined Springs, Custom Shock and Vibration\nIsolators, and Custom Actuators. Management does not track or otherwise account for sales broken down by these categories. Sales\nof the Company's products are made to three general groups of customers: industrial, structural and aerospace / defense. A\nbreakdown of sales to these three general groups of customers is as follows:\n2024 2023\nStructural $ 14,406,863 $ 20,642,326\nAerospace / Defense 26,675,321 15,568,695\nIndustrial 3,500,623 3,988,333\n$ 44,582,807 $ 40,199,354\nSales to a single customer approximated 21% of net sales for 2024.\n10.

The Company provides a valuation allowance to the extent that deferred tax assets may not be realized. A valuation\nallowance has not been recorded against the deferred tax assets since management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred\ntax assets are recoverable. The Company considers future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need\nfor a potential valuation allowance. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however, could be reduced in the\nnear term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. The Company will need to generate approximately $10.4 million in\ntaxable income in future years in order to realize the deferred tax assets recorded as of May 31, 2024 of $2,176,300.\nThe Company and its subsidiary file consolidated Federal and State income tax returns. As of May 31, 2024, the Company had\nState investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately $424,000 expiring through May 2029.\n11. Earnings Per Common Share:\nBasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average\ncommon shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the weighted-average common shares\noutstanding and dilutive potential common shares, such as stock options.\nA reconciliation of weighted-average common shares outstanding to weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming\ndilution is as follows:\n2024 2023\nAverage common shares outstanding 3,353,077 3,506,474\nCommon shares issuable under stock option plans 135,711 45,020\nAverage common shares outstanding assuming dilution 3,488,788 3,551,494\n12. Employee Stock Purchase Plan:\nIn March 2004, the Company reserved 295,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to a non-qualified employee stock\npurchase plan. Participation in the employee stock purchase plan is voluntary for all eligible employees of the Company. Purchase\nof common shares can be made by employee contributions through payroll deductions and without brokers‚Äô fees. At the end of\neach calendar quarter, the employee contributions will be applied to the purchase of common shares using a share value equal to\nthe mean between the closing bid and ask prices of the stock on that date. These shares are distributed to the employees at the end\nof each calendar quarter or upon withdrawal from the plan. During the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, 372 ($21.70 to $48.89\nprice per share) and 922 ($8.65 to $19.96 price per share) common shares, respectively, were issued to employees. As of May 31,\n2024, 215,993 shares were reserved for further issue.\n13. Stock Option Plans:\nIn 2022, the Company adopted a stock option plan which permits the Company to grant both incentive stock options and non-\nqualified stock options. The incentive stock options qualify for preferential treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. Under this\nplan, 260,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for grant to key employees and directors of the Company and 144,000\nshares have been granted as of May 31, 2024. Under the plan, the option price may not be less than the fair market value of the\nstock at the time the options are granted. Options vest immediately and expire ten years from the date of grant.\nUsing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted average estimated fair value of each option granted under the plan was\n$12.32 during 2024 and $4.91 during 2023. The pricing model uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected\nvolatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual\nlife of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected life of options granted is\nderived from previous history of stock exercises from the grant date and represents the period of time that options granted are\nexpected to be outstanding. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination assumptions\nunder the valuation model. The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate doing so in the\nforeseeable future.\n2024 2023\nRisk-free interest rate 4.00% 2.45%\nExpected life in years 4.3 4.2\nExpected volatility 37% 33%\nExpected dividend yield 0% 0%\nThe following is a summary of stock option activity:\nWeighted\nAverage Intrinsic\nShares Exercise Price Value\nOutstanding - May 31, 2022 283,000 $ 11.43 $ 28,248\nOptions granted 85,000 $ 15.75\nLess: options exercised 30,500 $ 9.57\nLess: options expired 4,500 -\nOutstanding - May 31, 2023 333,000 $ 12.70 $ 2,016,961\nOptions granted 85,000 $ 34.04\nLess: options exercised 76,750 $ 12.54\nLess: options expired 750 -\nOutstanding - May 31, 2024 340,500 $ 18.07 $11,185,815\nWe calculated intrinsic value for those options that had an exercise price lower than the market price of our common shares as of\nthe balance sheet dates. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options as of the end of each fiscal year is calculated as the\ndifference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the options that were\nin-the-money at that date (340,500 at May 31, 2024 and 279,500 at May 31, 2023). The Company's closing stock price was $50.92\nand $18.55 as of May 31, 2024 and 2023.

In the Action, the Board of Managers of 432 Park Condominium (the\n‚ÄúOwner‚Äù), a condominium association for a high-rise condominium building (the ‚ÄúBuilding‚Äù) located at 432 Park Avenue in New\nYork, N.Y., asserts a claim against the condominium sponsor, 56th and Park (NY) Owner LLC (the ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù) for damages arising\nfrom construction and design defects to the residential and commercial units at the Building.\nThe Sponsor subsequently filed a third-party complaint against LendLease Construction (US) LMB (‚ÄúLendLease‚Äù) and other parties\ninvolved in the Building‚Äôs design. As to LendLease, the third-party complaint alleges breach of a construction management contract\nbetween LendLease and the Sponsor and negligence arising from purported failure to perform under the contract, and seeks\nindemnification against any damages asserted against the Sponsor by the Owner.\nLendLease subsequently initiated a third-party complaint seeking indemnification from entities with whom LendLease had\ncontracted for the supply of materials and services in connection with construction of the Building. The third-party complaint also\nnames the Company as a third-party defendant based upon a contract between the Company and LendLease to supply 16 Viscous\nDamping Devices that were incorporated into a Tuned Mass Damper system designed by a third party to limit accelerations of the\nBuilding during wind events. The Company has timely filed and served an answer denying the allegations in LendLease‚Äôs third\nparty complaint.\nThe Action, and all of the related third-party actions, are pending in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court, New York\nCounty.\nOn June 17, 2024, the Court entered a scheduling order directing that the parties complete discovery by July 31, 2025 and file\ndispositive motions by October 17, 2025.\nIn view of the limited discovery to date, it is not possible to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or to quantify a\npotential loss.\nThis page is intentionally left blank\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe Company‚Äôs transfer agent is responsible for stockholder records, issuance of stock certificates and distribution\nof dividend payments and IRS Form 1099s.

So long as any\ndirector nominee proposed by shareholders meets the Criteria, the Nominating Committee will consider that nominee on the\nsame basis as other candidates. The Criteria include integrity, reputation, judgment, knowledge, independence, experience\nand accomplishments, board interaction, commitment, skills, and long-term commitment to service on our Board. The\nCommittee is required to apply the Criteria to candidates recommended by a Nominating Committee member, other directors,\nand management, as well as to any candidate meeting the Criteria recommended by shareholders.\n7\nDuring the selection process, the Nominating Committee seeks inclusion and diversity within the Board and adheres to the\nCompany's policy of maintaining an environment free from discrimination based upon race, color, religion, national origin,\nsex, age, disability, sexual preference or orientation, marital status, or any other unlawful factor. The Board strives to\nnominate directors with a variety of complementary skills so that, as a group, the Board will possess the appropriate talent,\nskills, and expertise to oversee the Company's business.\nIn addition, the Board assesses annually its overall effectiveness by means of a self-evaluation process. This evaluation\nincludes, among other things, an assessment of the overall composition of the Board, including a discussion as to whether the\nBoard has adequately considered diversity, among other factors, in identifying and discussing director candidates.\nThe Evaluation Process.\nThe Nominating Committee charter also describes the process for identifying and evaluating nominees for director, including\nthose nominated by shareholders.

Supporting documentation must include a detailed background of the proposed candidate and\ndemonstrate how the candidate meets the Criteria. The Nominating Committee applies the same standards in considering\nnominees submitted by shareholders as it does in evaluating all other candidates.

(referred to herein as the ‚ÄúCompany,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù) was incorporated in the State of New York on July\n22, 1955 and is engaged in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of shock absorption, rate control, and energy\nstorage devices for use in various types of machinery, equipment and structures. In addition to manufacturing and selling existing\nproduct lines, the Company continues to develop new and advanced technology products.\nPrincipal Products\nThe Company manufactures and sells a group of very similar products that have many different applications for customers. These\nsimilar products are included in one of nine categories, namely, Seismic Dampers, Fluidicshoks¬Æ, Crane and Industrial Buffers,\nSelf-Adjusting Shock Absorbers, Liquid Die Springs, Vibration Dampers, Machined Springs, Custom Shock and Vibration\nIsolators, and Custom Actuators. Custom derivations of all of these products are designed and manufactured for many aerospace\nand defense applications. The following is a summary of the capabilities and applications for these products.\nSeismic Dampers are designed to mitigate the effects of earthquakes on structures and represent a substantial portion of the\nCompany‚Äôs sales. Fluidicshoks¬Æ are small, extremely compact shock absorbers with up to 19,200 inch-pound capacities, produced\nin 12 standard sizes for primary use in the defense, aerospace and commercial industries. Crane and Industrial Buffers are larger\nversions of the Fluidicshoks¬Æ with up to 10,890,000 inch-pound capacities, produced in more than 50 standard sizes for industrial\napplications on cranes and crane trolleys, truck docks, ladle and ingot cars, ore trolleys and train car stops. Self-Adjusting Shock\nAbsorbers, which include versions of Fluidicshoks¬Æ and crane and industrial buffers, automatically adjust to different impact\nconditions, and are designed for high cycle application primarily in heavy industry. Liquid Die Springs are used as component\nparts of machinery and equipment used in the manufacture of tools and dies. Vibration Dampers are used primarily by the aerospace\nand defense industries to control the response of electronics and optical systems subjected to air, ship, or spacecraft vibration.\nMachined Springs are precisely controlled mechanical springs manufactured from a variety of materials. These are used primarily\nfor aerospace applications that require custom features that are not possible with conventional wound coil springs. Custom Shock\nand Vibration Isolators are comprised of various configurations including liquid springs, fluid dampers, elastomeric springs and\nPumpkin‚Ñ¢ Mounts. They are typically used for defense applications. Custom Actuators are typically of the gas-charged type,\nusing high pressure, that have custom features not available from other suppliers. These actuators are used for special aerospace\nand defense applications.\nSales and Distribution\nThe Company uses a technical sales force consisting of Company employees for sales in the United States. The Company uses the\nservices of several non-employee sales representatives for sales throughout the rest of the world. Specialized technical sales in\ncustom marketing activities outside the U.S. are serviced by these sales representatives under the direction and with the assistance\nof the Company's President and in-house technical sales staff. Sales representatives typically have non-exclusive agreements with\nthe Company, which, in most instances, provide for payment of commissions on sales at 5% to 10% of the product's net aggregate\nselling price. A limited number of foreign distributors also have non-exclusive agreements with the Company to purchase the\nCompany's products for resale purposes.\nCompetition\nThe Company faces some competition for hydraulic energy absorbers on mature aerospace and defense programs. Other competition\nin these sectors include the use of competing technologies, not necessarily of similar design as Taylor Devices‚Äô products. For the\nindustrial products group, two foreign companies and two U.S. companies are the Company‚Äôs main competitors in the production\nof crane buffers and industrial shock absorbers.\nThe Company competes directly against two other firms supplying structural damping devices for use in the U.S. For structural\napplications outside of the U.S., the Company competes directly with several other firms, particularly in Japan and Taiwan. The\nCompany competes with numerous other firms that supply alternative seismic protection technologies.\n4\nRaw Materials and Supplies\nThe principal raw materials and supplies used by the Company in the manufacture of its products are provided by numerous U.S.\nand foreign suppliers. The loss of any one of these suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nDependence Upon Major Customers\nSales to four customers approximated 40% (21%, 7%, 7%, and 5%, respectively) of net sales for 2024. The loss of any or all of\nthese customers, unless the business is replaced by the Company, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nPatents, Trademarks and Licenses\nThe Company holds ten patents expiring at different times until the year 2040.\nTerms of Sale\nThe Company does not carry significant inventory for rapid delivery to customers, and goods are not normally sold with return\nrights such as are available for consignment sales. The Company had no inventory out on consignment and there were no\nconsignment sales for the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023. No extended payment terms are offered. During the year ended\nMay 31, 2024, delivery time after receipt of orders averaged 8 to 10 weeks for the Company's standard products. Due to the\nvolatility of structural and aerospace/defense programs, we usually require progress payments for larger projects where the\nCompany supplies custom designed components.\nNeed for Government Approval of Principal Products or Services\nContracts between the Company and the federal government or its independent contractors are subject to termination at the election\nof the federal government. Contracts are generally entered into on a fixed price basis. If the federal government should limit\ndefense spending, these contracts could be reduced or terminated, which management believes would have a materially adverse\neffect on the Company.\nResearch and Development\nTo accommodate growth and to maintain its presence in current markets, the Company engages in product research and development\nactivities in connection with the design of its products. Occasionally, research and development for products in the aerospace and\ndefense sectors is funded by customers or the federal government. The Company also engages in research testing of its\nproducts. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company expended $388,000 and $1,097,000, respectively, on\nproduct research. For the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, government-funded research and development totaled $818,000 and\n$581,000, respectively. For the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, customer-funded research and development totaled $477,000\nand $285,000, respectively.\nGovernment Regulation\nCompliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has had\nno material effect on the Company, and the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.\nThe Company is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (\"OSHA\") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,\nwhich establish strict standards for the protection of employees, and impose fines for violations of such standards. The Company\nbelieves that it is in substantial compliance with OSHA.\nThe Company is also subject to regulations relating to production of products for the federal government. These regulations allow\nfor frequent governmental audits of the Company's operations and extensive testing of Company products. The Company believes\nthat it is in substantial compliance with these regulations.\n5\nEmployees\nAs of May 31, 2024, the Company had 128 total employees, consisting of 125 full-time employees and three part-time employees.\nThe Company has good relations with its employees, and none of the Company‚Äôs employees are covered by a collective bargaining\nagreement.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nSmaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nIn connection with the operation of the Company‚Äôs business, we identify, assess and manage key risks that may affect the Company,\nincluding material risks from cybersecurity threats through our system security plan. Our system security plan is aligned with the\n110 controls detailed in the NIST (SP) 800-171 and Department of Defense CMMC Level 2 guidelines for Cybersecurity . We have\ncompany-wide security policies, standards and controls that seek to incorporate best practices in security engineering, technology\narchitecture and data protection. Our policies and controls include security measures designed to protect our systems against\nunauthorized access. We also maintain cybersecurity protection measures covering our information technology systems, including\nwith respect to the protection of customer data, vendor data and employee information. We have also implemented specialized\ntraining and education programs to seek to guard against cybersecurity incidents, including company-wide communications and\npresentations, phishing simulations, focused training for specific roles and a general cybersecurity training program required for all\nemployees.\nWe engage third parties to perform regular reviews of our security controls which includes 24x7x365 security incident and event\nmanagement (SIEM) as well as vulnerability services and penetration testing. Our processes to identify, assess and manage material\nrisks from cybersecurity threats include risks associated with our use of third-party service providers, including cloud-based\nplatforms. We oversee and identify cybersecurity risks from our third-party service providers in a number of ways, including\nappropriate due diligence in connection with new third-party service provider onboarding, robust security terms and conditions in\nour third-party service provider contracts and ongoing risk-based monitoring to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards.\nWe believe that these policies and controls provide us with an appropriate assessment of potential cybersecurity threats.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this ‚ÄúForm 10-K‚Äù), we are not aware of any risks from any potential\ncybersecurity threat or from any previous cybersecurity incident that have materially affected or are likely to materially affect our\nbusiness strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, the preventative actions we have taken and continue to take\nto reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats and incidents may not successfully protect against these potential threats and incidents in\nthe future.\nGovernance\nThe Company‚Äôs Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing management‚Äôs identification, assessment and management of key\nrisks, including cybersecurity risks.\nOur Director of Information Technology, Mitch Reszczenski, is primarily responsible for assessing and managing our cybersecurity\nrisks. Mr. Reszczenski has over 28 years of extensive information technology experience in highly successful manufacturing,\nengineering and financial organizations. Mr. Reszczenski provides regular updates on cybersecurity risks and threats and key\ndevelopments in Company policies, practices and related risk exposures to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nAdditionally, senior management provides an update to the Board of Directors on cybersecurity matters at least once a year, and\nmore often as appropriate. The Board of Directors annually reviews and approves the capital and operating budgets, ultimately\nreviewing and approving the amount spent by the Company on cybersecurity measures.\n6\nMr. Reszczenski works with senior management to implement and oversee processes for the regular monitoring of our information\nsystems. If a cybersecurity incident involving the Company were to occur, Mr. Reszczenski would engage senior management to\ninitially determine the potential materiality of the incident, the potential need for public disclosure, the timing and extent of the\nCompany‚Äôs response and whether any future vulnerabilities are expected. As part of this evaluation, senior management would also\nidentify immediate actions to mitigate the impact and long-term strategies for remediation and prevention of future cybersecurity\nincidents. After an initial evaluation by senior management, the relevant information regarding the cybersecurity incident and its\nmateriality would be promptly reported to the Company‚Äôs Board of Directors for further review and evaluation, including as to\nwhether public disclosure would be required or advisable.\nItem 2. Properties.\nThe Company's production facilities occupy approximately six acres on Tonawanda Island in North Tonawanda, New York and are\ncomprised of four interconnected buildings and two adjacent buildings, each of which is owned by the Company. The production\nfacilities consist of a small parts plant (approximately 4,400 square feet), a large parts plant (approximately 13,500 square feet),\nand include a facility of approximately 7,000 square feet comprised of a test facility, storage area, pump area and the Company's\ngeneral offices. One adjacent building is a 27,000 square foot seismic assembly and test facility. This building contains overhead\ntraveling cranes to allow dampers to be built up to 45 ft. in length. It is also the site of three long bed damper test machines where\nseismic dampers manufactured by the Company will be tested at maximum force to satisfy customer specifications. Another\nadjacent building (approximately 2,000 square feet) is used as a training facility. These facilities total more than 54,000 square\nfeet. Adjacent to these facilities, the Company has a remote test facility used for shock testing. This state-of-the-art test facility is\n1,200 square feet. The Company owns two additional industrial buildings on nine acres of land in the City of North Tonawanda\nlocated 1.4 miles from the Company‚Äôs headquarters on Tonawanda Island. Total area of the two buildings is 46,000 square feet.\nOne building includes a machine shop containing custom-built machinery for boring, deep-hole drilling and turning of parts.\nAnother is used for painting and packaging parts and completed units.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nRefer to Note 17, ‚ÄúLegal Proceedings,‚Äù to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the\nCompany‚Äôs legal proceedings, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\n7\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nThe Company's Common Stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol TAYD.\nHolders\nAs of August 1, 2024, the number of record holders of the Company's Common Stock was 381. A substantial number of shares of\nthe Company's Common Stock are held in street name. The Company believes that the total number of beneficial owners of its\nCommon Stock is approximately 3,300.\nDividends\nThe Company does not pay a cash dividend and plans to retain cash in the foreseeable future to fund working capital needs.\nItem 6. [Reserved].\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCautionary Statement\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \"safe harbor\" for forward-looking statements. Information in this\nItem 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and elsewhere in this Form 10-\nK that does not consist of historical facts are \"forward-looking statements.\" Statements accompanied or qualified by, or containing,\nwords such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\"\n\"outlook,\" \"forecast,\" \"anticipates,\" \"presume,\" \"assume\" and \"optimistic\" constitute forward-looking statements and, as such, are\nnot a guarantee of future performance. These statements involve factors, risks and uncertainties, the impact or occurrence of which\ncan cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in such statements. Risks and uncertainties can\ninclude, among others: fluctuations in general business cycles and changing economic conditions; variations in timing and amount\nof customer orders; changing product demand and industry capacity; increased competition and pricing pressures; advances in\ntechnology that can reduce the demand for the Company's products, as well as other factors, many or all of which may be beyond\nthe Company's control. Consequently, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as predictive of\nfuture results. Except as required by law, the Company disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to the\nforward-looking statements herein to reflect any change in the Company's expectations with regard thereto, or any changes in\nevents, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles. The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions\nand judgments that affect the amounts reported. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are affected by management's\napplication of accounting policies, which are discussed in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\", and elsewhere in\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements. As discussed below, our financial position or results of operations may be\nmaterially affected when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.\nIn the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to\nreflect more current information. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant\njudgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements.\nAccounts Receivable\nOur ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows. Accounts\nreceivable are stated at an amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for probable\nuncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the current\nstatus of individual accounts after considering the age of each receivable and communications with the customers involved.\n8\nBalances that are collected, for which a credit to a valuation allowance had previously been recorded, result in a current-period\nreversal of the earlier transaction charging earnings and crediting a valuation allowance. Balances that are still outstanding after\nmanagement has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to\naccounts receivable in the current period. The actual amount of accounts written off over the five year period ended May 31, 2024\nequaled 0.2% of sales for that period. The balance of the valuation allowance is unchanged at $29,000 at both May 31, 2024 and\nMay 31, 2023. Management does not expect the valuation allowance to materially change in the next twelve months for the current\naccounts receivable balance.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Average cost approximates first-in, first-out cost.\nMaintenance and other inventory represent stock that is estimated to have a product life-cycle in excess of twelve-months. This\nstock represents certain items the Company is required to maintain for service of products sold, and items that are generally subject\nto spontaneous ordering.\nThis inventory is particularly sensitive to technical obsolescence in the near term due to its use in industries characterized by the\ncontinuous introduction of new product lines, rapid technological advances, and product obsolescence. Therefore, management of\nthe Company has recorded an allowance for potential inventory obsolescence. Based on certain assumptions and judgments made\nfrom the information available at that time, we determine the amount in the inventory allowance. If these estimates and related\nassumptions or the market changes, we may be required to record additional reserves. Historically, actual results have not varied\nmaterially from the Company's estimates. There was $791,000 and $322,000 of inventory disposed of during the years ended May\n31, 2024 and 2023. The provision for potential inventory obsolescence was $386,000 and $295,000 for the years ended May 31,\n2024 and 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, the Company transfers control of promised products or services to a customer in an amount that\nreflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account.\nA contract‚Äôs transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the\nperformance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer\nthe individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts which are, therefore, not distinct.\nPromised goods or services that are immaterial in the context of the contract are not separately assessed as performance obligations.\nFor contracts with customers in which the Company satisfies a promise to the customer to provide a product that has no alternative\nuse to the Company and the Company has enforceable rights to payment for progress completed to date inclusive of profit, the\nCompany satisfies the performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time (generally less than one year), using costs incurred\nto date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred\ncost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract\ncosts include labor, material and overhead. Total estimated costs for each of the contracts are estimated based on a combination of\nhistorical costs of manufacturing similar products and estimates or quotes from vendors for supplying parts or services towards the\ncompletion of the manufacturing process. Adjustments to cost and profit estimates are made periodically due to changes in job\nperformance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements. These changes may\nresult in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Any losses expected\nto be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined. If total costs calculated\nupon completion of the manufacturing process in the current period for a contract are more than the estimated total costs at\ncompletion used to calculate revenue in a prior period, then the profits in the current period will be lower than if the estimated costs\nused in the prior period calculation were equal to the actual total costs upon completion. Historically, actual results have not varied\nmaterially from the Company's estimates. Other sales to customers are recognized upon shipment to the customer based on contract\nprices and terms. In the year ended May 31, 2024, 59% of revenue was recorded for contracts in which revenue was recognized\nover time while 41% was recognized at a point in time. In the year ended May 31, 2023, 61% of revenue was recorded for contracts\nin which revenue was recognized over time while 39% was recognized at a point in time.\n9\nFor financial statement presentation purposes, the Company nets progress billings against the total costs incurred and estimated\nearnings on uncompleted contracts. The asset, \"costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings,\" represents revenues recognized\nin excess of amounts billed. The liability, \"billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings,\" represents billings in excess of\nrevenues recognized.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes provides for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements regardless of when\nsuch taxes are payable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary\ndifferences between the tax and financial statement basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets relate principally to asset\nvaluation allowances such as inventory obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves and also to liabilities including warranty\nreserves, accrued vacation, accrued commissions and others. The deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to differences between\nfinancial statement and tax depreciation. Deferred taxes are based on tax laws currently enacted with tax rates expected to be in\neffect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nRealization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income at the time temporary differences become\ndeductible. The Company provides a valuation allowance to the extent that deferred tax assets may not be realized. A valuation\nallowance has not been recorded against the deferred tax assets since management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred\ntax assets are recoverable. The Company considers future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need\nfor a potential valuation allowance. In future years the Company will need to generate approximately $10.4 million of taxable\nincome in order to realize our deferred tax assets recorded as of May 31, 2024 of $2,176,000. This deferred tax asset balance is\n38% ($594,000) higher than at the end of the prior year. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however, could\nbe reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. If actual results differ from estimated results or if the\nCompany adjusts these assumptions, the Company may need to adjust its deferred tax assets or liabilities, which could impact its\neffective tax rate.\nThe Company's practice is to recognize interest related to income tax matters in interest income / expense and to recognize penalties\nin selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe Company and its subsidiary file consolidated federal and state income tax returns. As of May 31, 2024, the Company had state\ninvestment tax credit carryforwards of approximately $470,000 expiring through May 2029.\nResults of Operations\nA summary of the period-to-period changes in the principal items included in the consolidated statements of income is shown\nbelow:\nSummary comparison of the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023\nIncrease /\n(Decrease)\nSales, net $ 4,384,000\nCost of goods sold $ 494,000\nResearch and development costs $ (708,000)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 1,928,000\nOther income (expense) $ 745,000\nIncome before provision for income taxes $ 3,415,000\nProvision for income taxes $ 704,000\nNet income $ 2,711,000\n10\nFor the year ended May 31, 2024 (All figures being discussed are for the year ended May 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended\nMay 31, 2023.)\nYear ended May 31 Change\n2024 2023 Amount Percent\nNet Revenue $ 44,583,000 $ 40,199,000 $ 4,384,000 11%\nCost of sales 23,744,000 23,250,000 494,000 2%\nGross profit $ 20,839,000 $ 16,949,000 $ 3,890,000 23%\n‚Ä¶ as a percentage of net revenues 47% 42%\nThe Company's consolidated results of operations showed an 11% increase in net revenues and an increase in net income of 43%.\nRevenues recorded in the year ended May 31, 2024 for long-term projects (‚ÄúProject(s)‚Äù) were 8% higher than the level recorded in\nthe prior year. We had 39 Projects in process during the year ended May 31, 2024 compared with 52 during the same period last\nyear. Revenues recorded in the year ended May 31, 2024 for other-than long-term projects (non-projects) were 15% higher than\nthe level recorded in the prior year. The number of Projects in-process fluctuates from period to period. The changes from the\nprior year to the year ended May 31, 2024 are not necessarily representative of future results.\nSales of the Company's products are made to three general groups of customers: industrial, structural and aerospace / defense. The\nCompany saw a 30% decrease from last year‚Äôs level in sales to structural customers who were seeking seismic / wind protection for\neither construction of new buildings and bridges or retrofitting existing buildings and bridges along with a 71% increase in sales to\ncustomers in aerospace / defense and a 12% decrease in sales to customers using our products in industrial applications.\nA breakdown of sales to these three general groups of customers, as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal years ended May\n31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nYear ended May 31\n2024 2023\nIndustrial 8% 10%\nStructural 32% 51%\nAerospace / Defense 60% 39%\nTotal sales within the U.S. increased 18% from last year. Total sales to Asia decreased 55% from the prior year. Net revenue by\ngeographic region, as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nYear ended May 31\n2024 2023\nU.S. 86% 81%\nAsia 4% 11%\nOther 10% 8%\nThe gross profit as a percentage of net revenue of 47% in the year ended May 31, 2024 is five percentage points greater than the\nsame period of the prior year (42%). The Company has been able to increase sales prices to recover more of the increased costs for\nmaterials and labor that were incurred during the year ended May 31, 2024. Management continues to work with suppliers to obtain\nmore visibility of conditions affecting their respective markets. These actions combined with benefits from the Company‚Äôs\ncontinuous improvement initiatives and increased volume have helped to improve the gross margin as a percentage of revenue over\nthe prior year.\nAt May 31, 2024, we had 134 open sales orders in our backlog with a total sales value of $33.1 million. At May 31, 2023, we had\n134 open sales orders in our backlog with a total sales value of $32.5 million. $18.6 million of the current backlog is on Projects\nalready in progress. $18.1 million of the $32.5 million sales order backlog at May 31, 2023 was in progress at that date. 72% of the\nsales value in the backlog is for aerospace / defense customers compared to 74% at the end of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of the\ntotal sales order backlog, orders from structural customers accounted for 22% at May 31, 2024 and 22% at May 31, 2023. The\nCompany expects to recognize revenue for the majority of the backlog during the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025, with the\nremainder during the fiscal year ending May 31, 2026.\n11\nThe Company's backlog, revenues, commission expense, gross margins, gross profits, and net income fluctuate from period to\nperiod. Total sales in the current period and the changes in the current period compared to the prior period, are not necessarily\nrepresentative of future results.\nResearch and Development Costs\nYears ended May 31 Change\n2024 2023 Amount Percent\nR & D $ 388,000 $ 1,097,000 $ (709,000) -65%\n‚Ä¶ as a percentage of net revenues 0.9% 2.7%\nResearch and development costs decreased 65% from the prior year. This decrease was driven by the completion of the Taylor\nDamped Moment Frame‚Ñ¢ project.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nYears ended May 31 Change\n2024 2023 Amount Percent\nS G & A $ 10,971,000 $ 9,043,000 $ 1,928,000 21%\n‚Ä¶ as a percentage of net revenues 25% 22%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 21% from the prior year, primarily from increased personnel costs.\nOperating Income\nOperating income of $9,479,000 for the year ended May 31, 2024, showed significant improvement from the $6,809,000 operating\nincome in the prior year. The increase in operating income was attributed to the decrease in research and development costs as well\nas improved gross margin performance.\nOther Income (expense)\nOther income increased 104% from the prior year due to increased interest income from higher levels of short-term investments\nduring the course of the year.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate (ETR) is calculated based upon current assumptions relating to the year's operating results and\nvarious tax related items. The ETR for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 is 18%, compared to the ETR for the prior year of 16%.\nA reconciliation of provision for income taxes at the statutory rate to income tax provision at the Company's effective rate is as\nfollows:\n2024 2023\nComputed tax provision at the expected statutory rate $ 2,293,000 $ 1,575,000\nTax effect of permanent differences:\nResearch tax credits (408,000) (284,000)\nForeign-derived intangible income deduction (142,000) (67,000)\nStock option costs 49,000 -\nOther permanent differences 3,000 1,000\nOther 127,000 (7,000)\n$ 1,922,000 $ 1,218,000\nThe foreign-derived intangible income deduction is a tax deduction provided to corporations that sell goods or services to foreign\ncustomers. It became available through Public Law 115-97, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n12\nLiquidity and Capital Resources, Line of Credit and Long-Term Debt\nThe Company's primary liquidity requirements depend on its working capital and capital expenditure needs. Working capital\nconsists primarily of cash and short-term investments, inventory, accounts receivable, costs and estimated earnings in excess of\nbillings, accounts payable, accrued expenses and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. The Company's primary source\nof liquidity has been excess cash flow from operations.\nCapital expenditures for the year ended May 31, 2024 were $1,149,000 compared to $3,359,000 in the prior year. The Company\nalso acquired Pumpkin‚Ñ¢ Mounts intellectual property during the year ended May 31, 2024 for $300,000. Current year capital\nexpenditures included new manufacturing machinery, testing equipment, upgrades to technology equipment and assembly / test\nfacility improvements. The Company has commitments to make capital expenditures of approximately $1,360,000 as of May 31,\n2024. These capital expenditures will be primarily for new manufacturing and testing equipment.\nOn January 4, 2024, the Company entered into a redemption agreement to purchase 459,015 of the Company‚Äôs shares of the capital\nstock of the Company, which represented approximately 13% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the\nCompany as of January 8, 2024 (the ‚ÄúClosing Date‚Äù), from the Ira Sochet Trust and the Ira Sochet Roth IRA. Each of the foregoing\ncounterparties are non-affiliates of the Company. The agreed purchase price was $19.92 per share, which constituted 87.6% of the\naverage price ($22.74) at which shares of the Company's common stock traded on the Closing Date.\nThe Company has a $10,000,000 demand line of credit with M&T Bank, with interest payable at the Company's option of 30, 60\nor 90 day SOFR rate plus 2.365%. There is no outstanding balance at May 31, 2024. The line is secured by a negative pledge of\nthe Company's real and personal property and is subject to renewal annually. The bank is not committed to make loans under this\nline of credit and no commitment fee is charged.\nManagement believes that the Company's cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and borrowing capacity under the bank line\nof credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations and capital improvements for the next twelve months.\nInventory and Maintenance Inventory\nMay 31, 2024 May 31, 2023 Increase /(Decrease)\nRaw materials $ 887,000 $ 674,000 $ 213,000 32%\nWork-in-process 6,412,000 5,005,000 1,407,000 28%\nFinished goods 213,000 262,000 (49,000) -19%\nInventory 7,512,000 83% 5,941,000 86% 1,571,000 26%\nMaintenance and other inventory 1,580,000 17% 1,003,000 14% 577,000 58%\nTotal $ 9,092,000 100% $ 6,944,000 100% $ 2,148,000 31%\nInventory turnover 3.0 3.5\nInventory, at $7,512,000 as of May 31, 2024, is 26 percent higher than at the prior year-end. Of this, approximately 85% is work\nin process, 3% is finished goods, and 12% is raw materials. All of the current inventory is expected to be consumed or sold within\ntwelve months. The level of inventory will fluctuate from time to time due to the stage of completion of the non-project sales orders\nin progress at the time.\nThe Company disposed of approximately $791,000 and $322,000 of obsolete inventory during the years ended May 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively.\n13\nAccounts Receivable, Costs and Estimated Earnings in Excess of Billings (‚ÄúCIEB‚Äù) and Billings in Excess of Costs and\nEstimated Earnings (‚ÄúBIEC‚Äù)\nMay 31, 2024 May 31, 2023 Increase /(Decrease)\nAccounts receivable 5,212,000 5,554,000 (342,000) -6%\nCIEB 4,357,000 4,124,000 233,000 6%\nLess: BIEC 5,601,000 1,992,000 3,609,000 181%\nNet $ 3,968,000 $ 7,686,000 $ (3,718,000) -48%\nNumber of an average day‚Äôs sales outstanding in\naccounts receivable (DSO) 39 47\nThe Company combines the totals of accounts receivable, the asset CIEB, and the liability BIEC, to determine how much cash the\nCompany will eventually realize from revenue recorded to date. As the accounts receivable figure rises in relation to the other two\nfigures, the Company can anticipate increased cash receipts within the ensuing 30-60 days.\nAccounts receivable of $5,212,000 as of May 31, 2024 includes no retainage by customers on long-term construction projects. The\nnumber of an average day's sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) was 39 days at May 31, 2024 and 47 days at May 31,\n2023. The Company expects to collect the net accounts receivable balance during the next twelve months.\nThe status of the projects in-progress at the end of the current and prior fiscal years have changed in the factors affecting the year-\nend balances in the asset CIEB, and the liability BIEC:\n2024 2023\nNumber of projects in progress at year-end 19 22\nAggregate percent complete at year-end 53% 33%\nAverage total value of projects in progress at year-end $2,089,000 $1,285,000\nPercentage of total value invoiced to customer 56% 29%\nThere are three less projects in-process at the end of the current fiscal year as compared with the prior year end and the average\nvalue of those projects has increased by 63% between those two dates.\nAs noted above, CIEB represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. Whenever possible, the Company negotiates a\nprovision in sales contracts to allow the Company to bill, and collect from the customer, payments in advance of shipments.\nUnfortunately, provisions such as this are often not possible. The $4,357,000 balance in this account at May 31, 2024 is a 6%\nincrease from the prior year-end. This increase reflects the higher aggregate level of the percentage of completion of these Projects\nas of the current year end as compared with the Projects in process at the prior year end. Generally, if progress billings are permitted\nunder the terms of a project sales agreement, then the more complete the project is, the more progress billings will be permitted.\nThe Company expects to bill the entire amount during the next twelve months. 58% of the CIEB balance as of the end of the last\nfiscal quarter, February 29, 2024, was billed to those customers in the current fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2024. The remainder\nwill be billed as the projects progress, in accordance with the terms specified in the various contracts.\nThe year-end balances in the CIEB account are comprised of the following components:\nMay 31, 2024 May 31, 2023\nCosts $ 9,644,000 $ 3,006,000\nEstimated earnings 9,782,000 2,648,000\nLess: Billings to customers 15,069,000 1,530,000\nCIEB $ 4,357,000 $ 4,124,000\nNumber of projects in progress 14 12\n14\nAs noted above, BIEC represents billings to customers in excess of revenues recognized. The $5,601,000 balance in this account\nat May 31, 2024 is in comparison to a $1,992,000 balance at the end of the prior year. The balance in this account fluctuates in the\nsame manner and for the same reasons as the account \"costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings,\" discussed above. Final\ndelivery of product under these contracts is expected to occur during the next twelve months.\nThe year-end balances in this account are comprised of the following components:\nMay 31, 2024 May 31, 2023\nBillings to customers $ 7,211,000 $ 6,538,000\nLess: Costs 933,000 2,343,000\nLess: Estimated earnings 677,000 2,203,000\nBIEC $ 5,601,000 $ 1,992,000\nNumber of projects in progress 5 10\nAccounts payable, at $1,439,000 as of May 31, 2024, is 16% less than the prior year-end. This decrease is normal fluctuation of\nthis account and is not considered to be unusual. The Company expects the current accounts payable amount to be paid during the\nnext twelve months.\nAccrued expenses of $4,664,000 increased 14% from the prior year level of $4,078,000. This change is due to increases in accrued\nincentive compensation resulting from increased earnings.\nItem 7A.

Controls and Procedures.\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company's chief executive officer (its principal executive officer) and chief financial officer (its principal financial officer)\nhave evaluated the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2024 and have concluded that, as of the evaluation\ndate, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the\nCompany files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC's rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits\nunder the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief\nfinancial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n15\n(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company's management, with the participation of the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is\nresponsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's management has\nassessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024. In making this assessment,\nmanagement used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control -- Integrated Framework, updated in 2013. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of May\n31, 2024, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n(c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.\nThere have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended\nMay 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's control over financial\nreporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nTrading Plans\nDuring the three months ended May 31, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a ‚ÄúRule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,‚Äù as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9C.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of the Company as of May 31, 2024and 2023, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company‚Äôs management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the currentperiod audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nF-2\nCost Estimates for Long-Term Contracts and Related Revenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter\nAs more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over\ntime for long-term contracts as goods are produced. The Company uses costs incurred as the method to determine\nprogress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The\nprocess of estimating margin at completion involves estimating the costs to complete production of goods and\ncomparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Long-term contracts are inherently uncertain in that\nrevenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant\nvariability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these contracts, changes to cost estimates\ncould occur, resulting in higher or lower marginswhen the contracts are completed.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing\nthese estimates involved a focused audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nOur auditing procedures related to the cost estimates for long-term contracts and related revenue recognition\nincluded the following, among others:\nÔÇ∑ We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management‚Äôs methods used todevelop its estimates.\nÔÇ∑ We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management\nrelating to key estimates.\nÔÇ∑ We selected a sample of executed contracts to understand the contract, perform an independent assessment\nof the appropriate timing of revenue recognition, and test the mathematical accuracy of revenue recognized\nbased on costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion.\nÔÇ∑ We performed inquiries of the Company‚Äôs project managers and others directly involved with the contracts\nto evaluate project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We\nalso observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the\nproject.\nÔÇ∑ We tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used to develop key estimates, including material,\nlabor, overhead, and sub-contractor costs.\nÔÇ∑ We performed retrospective reviews of prior year long-term contracts, comparing actual performance to\nestimated performance and the related financial statement impact, when evaluating the thoroughness and\nprecision of management‚Äôs estimation processin previous years.\nValuation of Inventory\nDescription of the Matter\nAs of May 31, 2024, the Company‚Äôs inventory balance was $7.5 million, net of a $59,000 allowance for\nobsolescence, its maintenance and other inventory balance was $1.6 million, net of an approximate $837,000\nallowance for obsolescence. As discussed in Note 5, maintenance and other inventory represents certain items that\nare estimated to have a product life-cycle in excess of twelve months the Company is required to maintain for\nservice of products sold and items that are generally subject to spontaneous ordering. The Company evaluates its\ninventory for obsolescence on an ongoing basis by considering historical usage as well as requirements for future\norders.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty and significant judgments necessary to estimate potential inventory obsolescence,\nauditing management‚Äôsestimates involved a high degree of auditor judgment.\nF-3\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nOur auditing procedures related to valuation of inventory included the following, among others:\nÔÇ∑ We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management‚Äôs methods used to develop its estimates.\nÔÇ∑ We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management\nrelating to key estimates.\nÔÇ∑ We inquired of management relative to write-offs of inventory during the year.\nÔÇ∑ We tested the completeness and accuracy of management‚Äôs schedule ofinventory.\nÔÇ∑ We developed an independent expectation of the obsolescence reserve based on our knowledge of the\nCompany‚Äôs inventory, including analysis of slow-moving items and historical usage and compared it to\nactual.\nÔÇ∑ We examined management‚Äôs lower of cost or net realizable value analysis and performed procedures to test\nits completeness and accuracy.\nÔÇ∑ We selected a sample ofmaterial purchases made during the year to ensure they were included in inventory\nat the proper value.\nÔÇ∑ During our physical inventory observation, we toured the Company‚Äôs warehouses and examined inventory\non hand for any indications of obsolescence.\nWe have served as the Company‚Äôs auditor since 1998.\nBuffalo, New York\nAugust 15, 2024\nF-4\nTAYLOR DEVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nNature of Operations:\nTaylor Devices, Inc. (the Company) manufactures and sells a single group of very similar products that have many different\napplications for customers. These similar products are included in one of nine categories; namely, Seismic Dampers,\nFluidicshoks¬Æ, Crane and Industrial Buffers, Self-Adjusting Shock Absorbers, Liquid Die Springs, Vibration Dampers, Machined\nSprings, Custom Shock and Vibration Isolators, and Custom Actuators for use in various types of machinery, equipment and\nstructures, primarily to customers which are located throughout the United States and several foreign countries. The products are\nmanufactured at the Company's sole operating facility in the United States where all of the Company's long-lived assets reside.\nManagement does not track or otherwise account for sales broken down by these categories.\n86% of the Company's 2024 revenue was generated from sales to customers in the United States and 4% was from sales to customers\nin Asia. Remaining sales were to customers in other countries in North America, Europe, Australia, and South America.\n81% of the Company's 2023 revenue was generated from sales to customers in the United States and 11% was from sales to\ncustomers in Asia. Remaining sales were to customers in other countries in North America, Europe, Australia, and South America.\nPrinciples of Consolidation:\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Tayco\nRealty Corporation (Realty). All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSubsequent Events:\nThe Company has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements through the\ndate the financial statements were issued.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and\naccompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nThe Company includes all highly liquid investments in money market funds in cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying\nbalance sheets.\nCash and cash equivalents in financial institutions may exceed insured limits at various times during the year and subject the\nCompany to concentrations of credit risk.\nF-9\nShort-Term Investments:\nAt times, the Company invests excess funds in liquid interest earning instruments. Short-term investments at May 31, 2024 and\nMay 31, 2023 include money market funds, US treasury securities and corporate bonds stated at fair value, which approximates\ncost. The short-term investments (22) mature on various dates during the period June 2024 to December 2026. Unrealized holding\ngains and losses would be presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred income\ntaxes. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined using the specific identification method.\nThe short-term investments are valued using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities. This\nincludes basing value on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.\nAccounts and Other Receivables:\nAccounts and other receivables are stated at an amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management\nprovides for probable uncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its\nassessment of the current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable\ncollection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to the receivable.\nInventory:\nInventory is stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Average cost approximates first-in, first-out cost.\nProperty and Equipment:\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided primarily using the straight-line\nmethod for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax reporting purposes. Maintenance and repairs are\ncharged to operations as incurred; significant improvements are capitalized.\nCash Value of Life Insurance:\nCash value of life insurance is stated at the surrender value of the contracts.\nRevenue Recognition:\nRevenue is recognized (generally at fixed prices) when, or as, the Company transfers control of promised products or services to a\ncustomer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those\nproducts or services.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account.\nA contract‚Äôs transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the\nperformance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer\nthe individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts which are, therefore, not distinct.\nPromised goods or services that are immaterial in the context of the contract are not separately assessed as performance obligations.\nFor contracts with customers in which the Company satisfies a promise to the customer to provide a product that has no alternative\nuse to the Company and the Company has enforceable rights to payment for progress completed to date inclusive of profit, the\nCompany satisfies the performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time (generally less than one year), using costs incurred\nto date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred\ncost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract\ncosts include labor, material and overhead. Adjustments to cost estimates are made periodically, and losses expected to be incurred\non contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined. Other sales to customers are recognized\nupon shipment to the customer based on contract prices and terms. In the year ended May 31, 2024, 59% of revenue was recorded\nfor contracts in which revenue was recognized over time while 41% was recognized at a point in time. In the year ended May 31,\n2023, 61% of revenue was recorded for contracts in which revenue was recognized over time while 39% was recognized at a point\nin time.\nF-10\nProgress payments are typically negotiated for longer term projects. Payments are otherwise due once performance obligations are\ncomplete (generally at shipment and transfer of title). For financial statement presentation purposes, the Company nets progress\nbillings against the total costs incurred on uncompleted contracts. The asset, ‚Äúcosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings,‚Äù\nrepresents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, ‚Äúbillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings,‚Äù\nrepresents billings in excess of revenues recognized.\nIf applicable, the Company recognizes an asset for the incremental material costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the\nCompany expects the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year and the costs are expected to be recovered. As of May 31,\n2024 and 2023, the Company does not have material incremental costs on any open contracts with an original expected duration of\ngreater than one year, and therefore such costs are expensed as incurred. These incremental costs include, but are not limited to,\nsales commissions incurred to obtain a contract with a customer.\nShipping and Handling Costs:\nShipping and handling costs on incoming inventory items are classified as a component of cost of goods sold, while shipping and\nhandling costs on outgoing shipments to customers are classified as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe amounts of these costs classified as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses were $190,939 and $366,763\nfor the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023. Shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of\nthe product are considered fulfillment activities, not performance obligations.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe provision for income taxes provides for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements regardless of when\nsuch taxes are payable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary\ndifferences between the tax and financial statement basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are based on tax laws currently\nenacted with tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nThe Company's practice is to recognize interest related to income tax matters in interest income / expense and to recognize penalties in\nselling, general and administrative expenses. The Company did not have any accrued interest or penalties included in its consolidated\nbalance sheets at May 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company recorded no interest expense or penalties in its consolidated statements of\nincome during the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company believes it is no longer subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities for years prior to May 31, 2021.\nSales Taxes:\nCertain jurisdictions impose a sales tax on Company sales to nonexempt customers. The Company collects these taxes from\ncustomers and remits the entire amount as required by the applicable law. The Company excludes from revenues and expenses the\ntax collected and remitted.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nThe Company measures compensation cost arising from the grant of share-based payments to employees at fair value and recognizes\nsuch cost in income over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The stock-\nbased compensation expense for the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 was $1,047,252 and $417,253.\nF-11\nNew Accounting Standards:\nAny recently issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) guidance has either been implemented or is not significant to the\nCompany.\nReclassifications:\nThe 2023 financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted for 2024.\n2.

Maintenance and Other Inventory:\n2024 2023\nMaintenance and other inventory $ 2,416,748 $ 2,236,106\nLess allowance for obsolescence 836,919 1,232,966\n$ 1,579,829 $ 1,003,140\nMaintenance and other inventory represent stock that is estimated to have a product life-cycle in excess of twelve-months. This\nstock represents certain items the Company is required to maintain for service of products sold, and items that are generally subject\nto spontaneous ordering. This inventory is particularly sensitive to technical obsolescence in the near term due to its use in industries\ncharacterized by the continuous introduction of new product lines, rapid technological advances and product obsolescence.\nTherefore, management of the Company has recorded an allowance for potential inventory obsolescence. $791,000 and $322,000\nof inventory was disposed of during the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023. The provision for potential inventory obsolescence\nwas $386,000 and $295,000 for the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company continues to rework slow-moving inventory,\nwhere applicable, to convert it to product to be used on customer orders.\n6.

Sales:\nThe Company manufactures and sells a single group of very similar products that have many different applications for customers.\nThese similar products are included in one of nine categories; namely, Seismic Dampers, Fluidicshoks¬Æ, Crane and Industrial\nBuffers, Self-Adjusting Shock Absorbers, Liquid Die Springs, Vibration Dampers, Machined Springs, Custom Shock and Vibration\nIsolators, and Custom Actuators. Management does not track or otherwise account for sales broken down by these categories. Sales\nof the Company's products are made to three general groups of customers: industrial, structural and aerospace / defense. A\nbreakdown of sales to these three general groups of customers is as follows:\n2024 2023\nStructural $ 14,406,863 $ 20,642,326\nAerospace / Defense 26,675,321 15,568,695\nIndustrial 3,500,623 3,988,333\n$ 44,582,807 $ 40,199,354\nSales to a single customer approximated 21% of net sales for 2024.\n10. Income Taxes:\n2024 2023\nCurrent tax provision:\nFederal $ 2,365,000 $ 1,710,000\nState 1,000 2,000\n2,366,000 1,712,000\nDeferred tax provision (benefit):\nFederal (444,000) (494,000 )\nState - -\n(444,000) (494,000 )\n$ 1,922,000 $ 1,218,000\nF-14\nA reconciliation of provision for income taxes at the statutory rate to income tax provision at the Company's effective rate is as\nfollows:\n2024 2023\nComputed tax provision at the expected statutory rate $ 2,293,400 $ 1,576,100\nState income tax - net of Federal tax benefit - (1,600)\nTax effect of permanent differences:\nResearch tax credits (407,675) (283,600)\nForeign-derived intangible income deduction (142,100) (66,900)\nStock option costs 48,500 -\nOther permanent differences 2,800 900\nOther 127,075 (6,900)\n$ 1,922,000 $ 1,218,000\nEffective income tax rate 17.6% 16.2%\nSignificant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:\n2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nAllowance for doubtful receivables $ 6,200 $ 6,200\nTax inventory adjustment 57,300 84,300\nAllowance for obsolete inventory 188,100 273,200\nAccrued vacation 163,000 136,600\nAccrued commissions - 9,800\nWarranty reserve 100,700 62,700\nR&D tax credit - -\nR&D capitalization 1,479,800 678,500\nStock options issued for services 181,200 331,300\n2,176,300 1,582,600\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nExcess tax depreciation (1,163,685) (1,013,985)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 1,012,615 $ 568,615\nRealization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income at the time temporary differences become\ndeductible. The Company provides a valuation allowance to the extent that deferred tax assets may not be realized. A valuation\nallowance has not been recorded against the deferred tax assets since management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred\ntax assets are recoverable. The Company considers future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need\nfor a potential valuation allowance. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however, could be reduced in the\nnear term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. The Company will need to generate approximately $10.4 million in\ntaxable income in future years in order to realize the deferred tax assets recorded as of May 31, 2024 of $2,176,300.\nThe Company and its subsidiary file consolidated Federal and State income tax returns. As of May 31, 2024, the Company had\nState investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately $424,000 expiring through May 2029.\nF-15\n11. Earnings Per Common Share:\nBasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average\ncommon shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the weighted-average common shares\noutstanding and dilutive potential common shares, such as stock options.\nA reconciliation of weighted-average common shares outstanding to weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming\ndilution is as follows:\n2024 2023\nAverage common shares outstanding 3,353,077 3,506,474\nCommon shares issuable under stock option plans 135,711 45,020\nAverage common shares outstanding assuming dilution 3,488,788 3,551,494\n12. Employee Stock Purchase Plan:\nIn March 2004, the Company reserved 295,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to a non-qualified employee stock\npurchase plan. Participation in the employee stock purchase plan is voluntary for all eligible employees of the Company. Purchase\nof common shares can be made by employee contributions through payroll deductions and without brokers‚Äô fees. At the end of\neach calendar quarter, the employee contributions will be applied to the purchase of common shares using a share value equal to\nthe mean between the closing bid and ask prices of the stock on that date. These shares are distributed to the employees at the end\nof each calendar quarter or upon withdrawal from the plan. During the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, 372 ($21.70 to $48.89\nprice per share) and 922 ($8.65 to $19.96 price per share) common shares, respectively, were issued to employees. As of May 31,\n2024, 215,993 shares were reserved for further issue.\n13. Stock Option Plans:\nIn 2022, the Company adopted a stock option plan which permits the Company to grant both incentive stock options and non-\nqualified stock options. The incentive stock options qualify for preferential treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. Under this\nplan, 260,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for grant to key employees and directors of the Company and 144,000\nshares have been granted as of May 31, 2024. Under the plan, the option price may not be less than the fair market value of the\nstock at the time the options are granted. Options vest immediately and expire ten years from the date of grant.\nUsing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted average estimated fair value of each option granted under the plan was\n$12.32 during 2024 and $4.91 during 2023. The pricing model uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected\nvolatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual\nlife of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected life of options granted is\nderived from previous history of stock exercises from the grant date and represents the period of time that options granted are\nexpected to be outstanding. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination assumptions\nunder the valuation model. The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate doing so in the\nforeseeable future.\n2024 2023\nRisk-free interest rate 4.00% 2.45%\nExpected life in years 4.3 4.2\nExpected volatility 37% 33%\nExpected dividend yield 0% 0%\nF-16\nThe following is a summary of stock option activity:\nWeighted\nAverage Intrinsic\nShares Exercise Price Value\nOutstanding - May 31, 2022 283,000 $ 11.43 $ 28,248\nOptions granted 85,000 $ 15.75\nLess: options exercised 30,500 $ 9.57\nLess: options expired 4,500 -\nOutstanding - May 31, 2023 333,000 $ 12.70 $ 2,016,961\nOptions granted 85,000 $ 34.04\nLess: options exercised 76,750 $ 12.54\nLess: options expired 750 -\nOutstanding - May 31, 2024 340,500 $ 18.07 $11,185,815\nWe calculated intrinsic value for those options that had an exercise price lower than the market price of our common shares as of\nthe balance sheet dates. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options as of the end of each fiscal year is calculated as the\ndifference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common shares for the options that were\nin-the-money at that date (340,500 at May 31, 2024 and 279,500 at May 31, 2023). The Company's closing stock price was $50.92\nand $18.55 as of May 31, 2024 and 2023.

Legal Proceedings:\nThe Company has been named as a third-party defendant in an action captioned Board of Managers of the 432 Park Condominium,\net al. v. 56th and Park (NY) Owner LLC, et al. (the ‚ÄúAction‚Äù).\nThe Action was filed on or about September 23, 2021. In the Action, the Board of Managers of 432 Park Condominium (the\n‚ÄúOwner‚Äù), a condominium association for a high-rise condominium building (the ‚ÄúBuilding‚Äù) located at 432 Park Avenue in New\nYork, N.Y., asserts a claim against the condominium sponsor, 56th and Park (NY) Owner LLC (the ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù) for damages arising\nfrom construction and design defects to the residential and commercial units at the Building.\nThe Sponsor subsequently filed a third-party complaint against LendLease Construction (US) LMB (‚ÄúLendLease‚Äù) and other parties\ninvolved in the Building‚Äôs design. As to LendLease, the third-party complaint alleges breach of a construction management contract\nbetween LendLease and the Sponsor and negligence arising from purported failure to perform under the contract, and seeks\nindemnification against any damages asserted against the Sponsor by the Owner.\nLendLease subsequently initiated a third-party complaint seeking indemnification from entities with whom LendLease had\ncontracted for the supply of materials and services in connection with construction of the Building. The third-party complaint also\nnames the Company as a third-party defendant based upon a contract between the Company and LendLease to supply 16 Viscous\nDamping Devices that were incorporated into a Tuned Mass Damper system designed by a third party to limit accelerations of the\nBuilding during wind events. The Company has timely filed and served an answer denying the allegations in LendLease‚Äôs third\nparty complaint.\nThe Action, and all of the related third-party actions, are pending in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court, New York\nCounty.\nOn June 17, 2024, the Court entered a scheduling order directing that the parties complete discovery by July 31, 2025 and file\ndispositive motions by October 17, 2025.\nIn view of the limited discovery to date, it is not possible to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or to quantify a\npotential loss.\nF-18"
