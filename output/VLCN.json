(NASDAQ:VLCN), (\"Volcon\" or the \"Company\"), the first all-electric, off-road powersports company, today announced that it filed an amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a 1-for-8 reverse stock split of its common stock. The reverse stock split will take effect at 11:59 pm (Eastern Time) on November 8, 2024, and the Company's common stock will open for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on November 11, 2024 on a post-split basis, under the existing ticker symbol \"VLCN\" but with a new CUSIP number 92864V509.\n\nAs a result of the reverse stock split, every 8 shares of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding prior to the opening of trading on November 11, 2024 will be consolidated into one issued and outstanding share, with no change in the nominal par value per share of $0.00001. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Each stockholder of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will be entitled to the rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole number.\n\nAs a result of the reverse stock split, the number of shares of common stock outstanding will be reduced from approximately 4.49 million shares to approximately 0.56 million shares, and the number of authorized shares of common stock will remain at 250 million shares. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Company's equity compensation plan immediately prior to the reverse stock split will be reduced proportionately.\n\n**About Volcon**\n\nBased in the Austin, Texas area, Volcon was founded as the first all-electric power sports company producing high-quality and sustainable electric vehicles for the outdoor community. Volcon electric vehicles are the future of off-roading, not only because of their environmental benefits but also because of their near-silent operation, which allows for a more immersive outdoor experience.\n\nVolcon's vehicle roadmap includes both motorcycles and UTVs. Its first product, the innovative Grunt, began shipping to customers in late 2021 and combines a fat-tired physique with high-torque electric power and a near-silent drive train. The Volcon Grunt EVO, an evolution of the original Grunt with a belt drive, an improved suspension, and seat, began shipping to customers in October 2023. The Brat is Volcon's first foray into the wildly popular eBike market for both on-road and off-road riding and is currently being delivered to dealers across North America. In 2024, Volcon entered the rapidly expanding LUV and UTV market and shipped its first production MN1 unit in October 2024. The new MN1 and HF1 products empower the driver to explore the outdoors in a new and unique way that gas-powered units cannot. They offer the same thrilling performance of a standard LUV / UTV without the noise (or pollution), allowing the driver to explore the outdoors with all their senses.\n\n**Volcon Contacts**\n\nFor Media: media@volcon.comFor Dealers: dealers@volcon.comFor Investors: investors@volcon.comFor Marketing: marketing@volcon.comFor more information on Volcon or to learn more about its complete motorcycle and side-by-side line-up, visit: [www.volcon.com](https://pr.report/42iz)\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nSome of the statements in this release are forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.

BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are an all-electric, off-road powersports vehicle company developing electric two and four-wheel motorcycles and utility terrain vehicles, or UTVs, also known as\nside-by-sides, along with a line of upgrades and accessories. In October 2020, we began building and testing prototypes for our future offerings with two off-road motorcycles –\nthe Grunt and the Runt. Our motorcycles feature unique frame designs protected by design patents. Additional utility and design patents have been filed for other aspects of\nVolcon’s vehicles.\nInitially, we began to sell and distribute the Grunt and related accessories in the United States on a direct-to-consumer sales platform. However, we terminated our\nGrunt direct-to-consumer sales platform in November 2021. Beginning in November 2021, we began negotiating dealership agreements with powersports dealers to display and\nsell our vehicles and accessories. Customers can now, or will soon be able to, buy our vehicles and accessories directly from a local dealership. Some of these dealers will also\nprovide warranty and repair services to customers. As of March 15, 2024, we have 103 active dealers. Dealers can order any of our available products provided they are current\non their accounts receivable and are within their established credit limit. We are offering dealers payment terms 30 to 90 days to make larger purchases of our vehicles. We have\nentered into an accounts receivable factoring arrangement to allow the Company the ability to generate cash for working capital. We have agreements with third party financing\ncompanies to provide financing to qualified customers of each dealer. There is no recourse to the Company or the dealer if the dealer’s customer defaults on the financing\nagreement with the third party.\nWe sell our vehicles internationally through importers. Each importer buys vehicles by the container and sells vehicles and accessories to local dealers or directly to\nconsumers. Local dealers or the importer will provide warranty and repair services for vehicles purchased in their country. In October 2023, we made a decision to postpone\nexpanding our dealer network in Canada for the foreseeable future and we have terminated the employment of our Canadian regional sales managers. As of March 15, 2024, we\nhave signed agreements with six importers in Latin America, one importer for the Caribbean Region, collectively referred to herein as the LATAM importers, one importer in\nNew Zealand, and one importer in Australia to sell our vehicles and accessories in their assigned countries/markets. In 2024, we expect to expand our global sales of our\nvehicles and accessories beyond our current distributor base.\nIn June 2022, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Torrot Electric Europa S.A., referred to herein as Torrot, to distribute their electric motorcycles for\nyouth riders in Latin America. In October 2022, we signed an expanded agreement with Torrot, which superseded the June 2022 agreement, to also be the exclusive distributor\nof Torrot and Volcon co-branded youth electric motorcycles in the U.S. as well as Latin America. Finally, in December 2022, we signed an expanded agreement with Torrot to\nbe the exclusive distributor of Volcon co-branded youth electric motorcycles in Canada. In June 2023, we wrote down all remaining Torrot branded inventory in the amount of\n$84,000. In December 2023 we notified Torrot that we were terminating our agreements due to continued lower than expected sales at significantly discounted pricing. In 2023,\nwe wrote down the Volcon co-branded Torrot youth motorcycles by $2,674,352 to reduce their cost to the estimated net realizable value due to lower than expected sales. We\nhave agreed to give Torrot a total of 1,000 Volcon branded Torrot motorcycles originally purchased for $1.8 million, an up front payment of $370,000 and an additional $1.7\nmillion to be paid out at $100,000 over 17 months beginning in April 2024 in exchange for unfulfilled 2023 and 2024 unit purchases. As of December 31, 2023, we have\nVolcon Youth inventory of approximately $239,935, after reducing these to the estimated net realizable value, of Volcon branded Torrot motorcycles and accessories which we\nintend to liquidate and we have agreed to give Torrot sales rights in the U.S., Canada and LATAM after June 30, 2024.\nIn July 2022, we expanded our offerings with the introduction of the first of our Volcon UTV models, the Stag, which we initially anticipated would be available for\ndelivery to customers in the fourth quarter of 2023, followed by additional models of the Stag expected in 2024 and 2025. We delivered the first Stag to a customer in February\n2024. The Stag is being manufactured by a third party and incorporates electrification units, which include batteries, drive units and control modules provided by General\nMotors. Beginning in June 2022, we took non-binding pre-production orders which were cancelable prior to delivery. In the third quarter of 2023 we canceled all of the original\npre-production orders due to the introduction of multiple models and new pricing. We began taking new pre-production orders for the newly introduced models in the third\nquarter of 2023.\n1\nIn August 2022, we ceased manufacturing of the Grunt and we outsourced the manufacturing of the remaining Grunts and the 2023 Grunt EVO to the same third party\nmanufacturer as the Stag. The 2023 Grunt EVO has replaced the Grunt and has a belt drive rather than a chain drive as well as an updated rear suspension. We began selling the\nGrunt EVO in the third quarter of 2023.\nWe began taking pre-orders for an E-Bike, the Brat, in September 2022 and shipments to customers began in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Brat is being\nmanufactured by a third party. In January 2023, we began selling the Brat directly to consumers through our website. Consumers who order the Brat from our website can have\nthe Brat shipped to their specified destination.\nIn November 2022, we finalized an agreement for the same third party that manufactures the Stag and Grunt EVO to manufacture the Runt LT. We received prototypes\nof the Runt LT in the first quarter of 2023. We are evaluating the market for the Runt LT and will determine whether to proceed with production in the first half of 2024.\nThe estimated fulfillment of all orders we have received assumes that our third party manufacturers can successfully meet our order quantities and deadlines. If they\nare unable to satisfy orders on a timely basis, our customers may cancel their orders.\nIn September and October 2023, we reduced our headcount in several departments to reduce costs and we continue to evaluate other cost reduction opportunities.\nOur Industry\nThe powersports industry is made up of on-road and off-road motorcycles, scooters, ATVs (all-terrain vehicles), UTVs, PWC (personal watercraft) and snowmobiles.\nThe ATV market, in which a single rider sits on top of a four-wheeled vehicle (as opposed to sitting inside a UTV), is not a market we currently intend to pursue but will\ncontinue to evaluate our lineup of vehicles in the future. We have also developed an electric bicycle, or eBike, the Brat, primarily designed for on-road use but can also be\nridden off-road.\nWhile we are focusing solely on off-road for our motorcycles and UTVs, we are evaluating requirements in other countries where our vehicles will need to be\nhomologated for on-road and off-road use in order to sell them there. We are also considering homologation kits that customers could purchase to allow them to use our\nvehicles both on-road and off-road depending on federal, state and local government rules and regulations.\nOutdoor recreation is a major driver of the American economy. In 2022, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, or the BEA, found that outdoor recreation drives $563\nbillion of the current-dollar gross domestic product for the U.S. The BEA noted that motorcycles and ATVs make up $11.5 billion of that total.\nAccording to Stratview Research – Powersports Market Research Report, the powersports industry grew by 10% in terms of units in 2020, its highest growth rate ever\nachieved. The long-term outlook for growth and demand for powersports, according to the report, especially off-road vehicles, or ORVs, and power watercraft, or PWCs is\npositive. The Stratview Research report estimates the powersports market to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 5.7% during 2022 to 2027 to reach a value\nof\n$47.9 billion by 2027.\nAccording to a report by Allied Market Research, the global ATV and UTV market was valued at $7.6 billion in 2017, and is projected to reach $11.95 billion by 2027,\nregistering a CAGR of 6.7% from 2020 to 2027.\n2\nAccording to Market Reports World, the global off-road motorcycles market size is estimated to grow at CAGR of almost 8% with new vehicle sales of 124,950 units\nduring the forecast period 2022 to 2027.\nAccording to the PowerSports Business 2023 Market Data Book:\n· In the U.S., UTV sales were just under 550,000 units in 2022, according to leading industry research firm Power Products Marketing. New motorcycle sales in\n2022, meanwhile, were 733,537 units, according to the Motorcycle Industry Council. Reversing a trend where in 2021 where more new UTVs were sold at retail in\n2021 than new motorcycles.\n· According to dealership feedback, turnover of new unit inventory in 2022 at dealerships was 4.6 turns (compared to 7.5 turns) average. Similarly, new unit gross\nmargin percentage at the dealership level was 17.1% on average during 2022 (comparted to 17.4% in 2021).\n· Accessory sales for UTVs on average are $977 worth of accessories at the time of a UTV sport purchase in 2022, Lightspeed data shows.\n· According to S&P Global Mobility, 2022 new and used UTV registrations were 318,216 compared to 334,000 in 2021, showing continued post-pandemic strength\nin the segment.\nWhile inflationary pressures may have impacted demand, we believe the new culture of escape and outdoor activities will continue to drive off-road powersports\nrecreation. We believe there are very few all-electric off-road powersports companies, and traditional powersports companies have only recently started making electric\nproducts, so significant data on off-road electric vehicles does not exist yet.\nOur Products\nWe feature motorcycle and UTV products that are all-electric and primarily designed for off-road use, in addition to a Class 2 eBike, the Brat, that can be used on or\nlight off-road. The off-road market is growing faster than on-road and on-road products require costly levels of certification, homologation and compliance with the Department\nof Transportation (DOT), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and other government regulators. For our motorcycles and UTVs, we are solely\nfocusing on developing them for the off-road market. Due to these regulations, our motorcycles and UTVs are not legal for on-road use without homologation by customers\nwho may be able to purchase parts or kits from other third parties. All vehicles other than the Brat come or will come with a warning label stating “This vehicle is designed and\nmanufactured for off-road use only. It does not conform to federal motor vehicle safety standards and operation on public streets, roads, or highways is illegal”, and therefore\nour vehicles cannot be legally registered for on-road use in any state in the U.S and in many countries without the customer homologating the vehicle. In addition to\npowersports vehicles, we source, market and sell accessories and upgrades and continue to source new accessories and upgrades. These do or will feature parts designed to\nincrease performance or appearance, in addition to practical add-ons to equip Volcon vehicles for hunters, anglers, ranchers and farmers.\nThe Stag\nIn July 2022, we publicly introduced a prototype of the Stag. We began taking pre-production orders from dealers in June 2022 and consumers in July 2022. These\noriginal pre-production orders were canceled in the third quarter of 2023 and new pre-production orders were taken from dealers and consumers. The consumer pre-production\norders will be transferred to dealers located near the consumer. We delivered our first Stag to the Army Corps. of Engineers in February 2024. Pre-production orders of the Stag\nare non-binding and cancelable prior to delivery. The Stag will be Volcon’s first utility/sport UTV with a 64” width to ensure it is able to operate in states with 65”-maximum-\nwidth trails.\nThe 2024 Stag LTD is our first UTV model launched and will seat up to four people, with folding rear seats, a four point harness system, high performance shocks and\ntires, on demand all-wheel drive, variable power steering, and a full line of accessories.\nWe expect to introduce additional UTV models in the future but the timing and specifications have not yet been determined.\n3\nWe also expect to introduce a larger, longer range UTV (to be named) in the future, which will be the largest, most powerful model in the Volcon line. We are\ndesigning this vehicle to have superior range and speed, but still be able to haul and tow far more than a traditional UTV. The timing of the release of this vehicle has not been\ndetermined.\nOur ability to release new future products is dependent on the success of our current model and our ability to receive future financing of which there is no assurance.\nThe Grunt EVO\nOur first product to market, the Grunt, began shipping to customers in the third quarter of 2021. The Grunt EVO was introduced in 2023 and we began selling it in\nSeptember 2023. The Grunt EVO is different from the Grunt as it has a belt drive rather than a chain drive, an upgraded rear shock and rear suspension, and a new seat design\nand is available in three different colors. There are also aftermarket accessories available.\nThe Grunt EVO’s frame, low seat height and oversize tires are designed to make it look like the fat tire bikes of the 1970s and ’80s. These unique elements of the\nGrunt EVO are not just for styling, but we believe they help make it easier to ride as compared to other off-road motorcycles on the market. The low seat height and large tires\nare designed to make the Grunt EVO stable at all speeds on all surfaces in the off-road environment. The electric drivetrain has no clutch and no gears, making it easy for\nalmost anyone to operate.\nAlthough the Grunt EVO can be used as delivered, we have developed an app, which can be downloaded at no additional cost, that we believe will enhance the riding\nexperience. The Grunt EVO has a small, optional, dash with limited data; however, the rider can use their smartphones and the app (subject to the rider’s cellular connectivity)\nas a dashboard by mounting it on the handlebars. The app makes it easier for users to set ride modes, check battery status, and update the bike’s firmware.\nThe Grunt EVO is designed for family off-road adventures, work on the farm or fun transport around private land. Its range can be up to 35 miles (with an optional\nsecond battery that provides an additional 35 miles) in its “explore” mode setting and it can be completely charged in less than three hours from a standard wall outlet.\nThe Runt LT\nThe Runt LT, which is a smaller version of the Grunt EVO, is better suited for small statured riders, more compact properties and trails, or as a pit bike at race events,\nwhile still delivering robust off-road capabilities. Unlike the Grunt EVO, the Runt LT will only have a display to show the rider certain aspects of the vehicle such as speed,\nbattery charge and mode. The app will not be available in the initial version of the Runt LT but could be developed for future models.\nLike the Grunt EVO, the Runt LT’s large tires and low-slung chassis will make it easier to ride than traditional off-road motorcycles. The Runt LT will have a range of\nup to 35 miles in its “explore” mode setting and charges in less than three hours from a standard wall outlet. We are currently evaluating the market for the Runt LT to\ndetermine if we will produce it. We expect to make this decision in the first half of 2024.\nThe Brat\nSimilar to the lineup of Volcon motorcycles, the Brat has a low seat height, large tires and hydraulic front and rear disc brakes. The Brat is a Class 2 eBike capable of\nachieving 20 mph maximum speed from throttle assistance. The Volcon app will also work with the Brat provided the rider has downloaded the app to their smartphone and has\ncellular connectivity. We began selling the Brat in December 2022.\n4\nAssembly and Manufacturing\nWe have outsourced the manufacturing of all of our vehicles to third parties. The Brat is manufactured by a supplier in China and the Grunt EVO, Runt and Stag are or\nwill be manufactured by a supplier in Mexico. The Volcon Youth motorcycles were manufactured by Torrot in Spain.\nWe provide a one-year warranty on the Grunt EVO, Volcon Youth motorcycles and the Brat, and a two-year warranty on the battery pack subject to a specified number\nof charging cycles. We expect the warranty for our other motorcycles will be consistent with these warranties. Warranty for the Brat and Volcon Youth motorcycles is provided\nby the manufacturer provided that we timely submit the claim to them. The warranty for the Stag is also one year on parts and labor and two years on the battery. Certain parts\nwill be warranted by the part manufacturer or the vehicle manufacturer whereas other parts will be warranted by the Company.\nWe accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle is delivered to the customer. Warranty reserves include our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace\nany items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data. We review\nour reserves quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed. Warranty expense is\nrecorded as a component of cost of revenues in the statement of operations. The warranty obligation is classified as a current liability on our balance sheet.\nSales and Marketing\nThrough March 15, 2024, we have 103 dealers covering 28 states. We are currently negotiating additional dealership agreements with retail partners to display and sell\nour vehicles and accessories. Some of these dealers will also provide warranty and repair services to our customers. Customers can also purchase the Brat and Volcon Youth\nmotorcycles and related accessories on our website.\nWe anticipate our vehicles and accessories will be sold globally in a three-phase rollout of export sales– Latin American importers started in 2022, New Zealand in\n2023 and Australia in 2024, subject to meeting each countries homologation requirements, if any. Export sales are expected to be executed through individual importers in each\ncountry that purchase vehicles from us by the container. Each importer is expected to sell vehicles to local dealers or directly to customers. Local dealers are intended to provide\nwarranty and repair services for vehicles purchased within their markets.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we currently rely on a combination of\ntrade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our\ntechnology.\nOur industrial designs are protected by design patents. In addition, we intend to file for additional utility patents. There is no assurance that we will be granted any\nsuch patents. We do not know whether any patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims.\nEven if granted, there can be no assurance that our issued patents or new patent applications will provide us with protection.\nWe have registrations for the trademarks VOLCON and GRUNT in the U.S. We have also applied to register additional trademarks – including VOLCON, VOLCON\nBRAT, VOLCON STAG, GRUNT EVO, EMPOWERING ADVENTURE, RUNT, VOLCON RUNT, STAG, and VOLCON STAG - in the U.S., Canada, New Zealand,\nAustralia and certain additional countries in Latin America, and many of these trademarks are now allowed or registered in these countries. We have resolved some conflicts\nand potential conflicts that have arisen with regard to the use and registration of our trademarks through coexistence agreements and the submission of arguments. We have\nreceived notice from an entity in Brazil who has opposed our applications for trademarks including the word VOLCON, but we believe the trademarks and the goods being sold\nunder them are not similar and there is no potential for confusion.\n5\nWe have also identified that in Australia, VOLCON is similar to another trademark that does not appear to be in use. We have filed a removal application to remove the\nuse of the other trademark so that we can use VOLCON. However, there is no guarantee that our application to remove will be accepted. Our efforts to secure trademark\nregistrations for VOLCON and other trademarks referenced above are ongoing and we may encounter resistance from other companies, particularly as we expand into\nadditional territories. If we receive objections from other entities and are unsuccessful in obtaining agreements or otherwise resolving the matters with these entities, we will\nneed to consider the use of different trademarks for our Company and our products.\nCompetition\nThere are dozens of manufacturers that sell off-road motorcycles, UTVs and eBikes in the U.S. and even more globally. The markets for powersport vehicles and\neBikes are highly competitive based on a number of factors, including innovation, performance, price, technology, product features, styling, fit and finish, brand recognition,\nquality and distribution. We believe our ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on our ability to capitalize on our competitive strengths and build brand\nrecognition.\nMany companies, which have greater financial and marketing resources than Volcon, make electric street motorcycles, including Zero Motorcycles. Some companies\nmake electric UTVs as part of their product line. For example, Polaris has a joint venture with Zero Motorcycles to help them design dedicated electric UTVs, the first product\nof which began selling in 2023. Many companies, like Super 73, make and sell eBikes and have a stronger established brand name and product line.\nGovernment regulations\nWe have focused on the off-road-only portion of the market because it is free of many of the homologation issues and highway certifications required to produce and\nsell an on-road vehicle. In some states, off-road vehicles do have legislative restrictions, but they are related to noise and exhaust emissions, two things our vehicles do not\nproduce.\nFederal, state, and local governments have promulgated and/or are considering promulgating laws and regulations relating to the safety of our products. In the U.S., the\nConsumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to off-road vehicles and eBikes. We believe that our products comply\nwith all applicable CPSC safety standards as well as all other applicable safety standards in the U.S.\nThe assembly, use, storage, transport and disposal of battery packs is subject to extensive regulation. Complying with these requirements involves substantial costs,\nand any failure to do so may result in heavy fines or other restrictions on our operations. Additionally, we may be responsible for the recycling and proper disposal of expended\nbatteries from our vehicles. We may enter into agreements with third parties to manage such recycling and disposal; however, we may be found liable for any failures in\ncompliance by these third parties and subject to fines or remediation liabilities, which costs may be substantial.\nWe intend to sell and distribute our vehicles internationally through international distributors. As such, we will be subject to the local laws of each jurisdiction in which\nwe sell our vehicles. These regulations may result in increased costs and expenses, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial\ncondition.\n6\nHuman Capital\nVolcon Mission\nPeople are at the core of our DNA. Our mission is to build industry leading products that connect people to outdoor experiences through the intentional blending of\nleading technology and design. Our vision is to amplify the powersports experience for all. Our values are building the future of powersports. Our employees recognize that\neveryone is someone’s customer, which is why our goal is for each employee at Volcon is to treat others as you would want to be treated.\nProfessional Employer Organization\nSince inception through December 31, 2022, we have used professional employer organizations (\"PEOs\") to outsource our employee base, including processing of\npayroll and administration of benefits. Beginning January 1, 2023, we discontinued the use of a PEO and have hired a third party payroll processing service and a third party\nadministrator of benefits. As of December 31, 2023, in the U.S we have 35 full-time employees and one part-time employee and we do not have any employees outside of the\nU.S. Currently, our employees have not chosen representation by a labor union. We also occasionally engage the services of independent contractors for special projects.\nOur employees and contractors focus on customer care, developing our products, and building our marketing channels. We believe we offer competitive benefits and\ntraining programs to develop employees’ expertise, performance, and engagement, while implementing corporate policies to provide a safe, harassment-free work environment.\nThis work environment is guided by principles of fair and equal treatment and prioritizes effective communication and employee engagement.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe are committed to building a strong culture with high levels of employee engagement. We hold quarterly all-hands and ad hoc meetings where management\ndiscusses various topics with employees including operational updates, vehicle development, financing activities, company policies and safety. Management is also committed\nto being available to discuss any employee concerns on a one-on-one basis. We believe that our employees are our greatest asset and are striving to consistently evaluate our\nprogress in developing and maintaining engagement.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is at www.volcon.com. We make available, free of charge, on our corporate website, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,\ncurrent reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and\ninformation statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. Information contained on our website does not, and shall\nnot be deemed to, constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our reference to the URL for our website is intended to be an inactive textual reference only.\nITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider each of the following risks, together with all other information set forth in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the related notes, in evaluating an investment in our common stock. If any of the following risks\nactually occurs, our business could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional\nrisks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\n7\nRisks Related to the Company’s Business, Operations, and Industry\nOur losses from operations could continue to raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern\nrequires that we obtain sufficient funding to finance our operations.\nTo date we have funded operations through equity and debt offerings. As of December 31, 2023, we have an accumulated deficit of $120.8 million.\nIn February and March 2024, certain holders of the May 2023 Convertible Notes issued in May 2023 converted approximately $7.4 million of principal to common\nstock. In March 2024, the holders exchanged the remaining May 2023 Convertible Notes of $24.7 million for Series A convertible preferred stock with a $1,000 per share value\nand an initial conversion price of $1.33 per share for common stock. All covenants from the Convertible Notes were terminated upon this exchange. In March 2024, certain\nholders of the Series A convertible preferred stock converted $2.3 million shares to 1.7 million shares of common stock.\nManagement anticipates that our cash on hand as of December 31, 2023 plus the cash expected to be generated from operations will not be sufficient to fund planned\noperations and maintain required cash balances for the Convertible Notes beyond one year from the date of the issuance of the financial statements as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. There can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding to support our operations. There can be no assurance that such additional funding, if\nneeded, would be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified in our 2020 audit have not been remediated. If we are unable to remediate these\nmaterial weaknesses or we or our auditor identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may\nnot be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business and stock price.\nThe material weaknesses identified by our independent registered public accounting firm in our internal control over financial reporting in our 2020 audit have not\nbeen remediated as of December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. These material\nweaknesses are as follows:\n· Inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel\n· Insufficient formal written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, financial reporting and record keeping\nIn addition to hiring more finance and accounting personnel in 2021 to improve our segregation of duties, through 2023, we have made further progress towards\nremediating these material weaknesses. We have hired more experienced accounting and finance personnel. We have prepared some formal written policies and procedures for\naccounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping. We have also started the process of documenting our internal controls. However, we have not fully completed\ndocumentation or testing of these policies, procedures, and internal controls.\nWhile we believe these efforts have improved the internal control over financial reporting during 2023, they did not fully remediate the material weaknesses as we\nhave not fully documented all of our policies or procedures and we have not performed any testing of our internal controls.\nWe cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date and may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material\nweaknesses in internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. The effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events,\nthe possibility of human error and the risk of fraud. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, our ability to record, process and report financial information\naccurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods required of public companies could be adversely affected which, in turn, may adversely affect our\nreputation and business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, any such failures could result in litigation or regulatory actions by the SEC or other regulatory\nauthorities, loss of investor confidence, delisting of our securities and harm to our reputation and financial condition, or diversion of financial and management resources from\nthe operation of our business.\n8\nOur transition to an outsourced manufacturing, design and development business model may not be successful, which could harm our ability to deliver products and\nrecognize revenue.\nIn March 2022, we signed an agreement with a manufacturer in China to develop and manufacture the Brat, our first eBike. We provided this vendor with our\nspecifications and design drawings, and they developed prototypes and the manufacturing process to build the Brat at a cost that was acceptable to us. We launched the Brat in\nDecember 2022 and have sold the Brat throughout 2023 and expect to continue to sell the Brat in 2024.\nIn June 2022, we signed a distribution agreement with Torrot Electric Europa, S.A. (“Torrot”) to distribute their youth motorcycles through our LATAM distributors. In\nOctober 2022, we signed an exclusive distribution and co-branding agreement with Torrot, which replaces the original distribution agreement and allows Volcon to co-brand\nTorrot’s youth motorcycles using the Volcon name and branding in the U.S. and Latin America. This was expanded to Canada through a separate agreement signed in December\n2022. These products are manufactured by Torrot in Spain. Due to lower than expected sales of youth motorcycles, in 2023 we have written down our inventory of these\nmotorcycles to its estimated net realizable value and recorded an expense of $2.7 million. In December 2023 we notified Torrot that we want to terminate this agreement and\nwe will liquidate any remaining Volcon Youth motorcycle inventory. We have agreed to give Torrot a total of 1,000 Volcon branded Torrot motorcycles originally purchased for\n$1.8 million, an up front payment of $370,000 and an additional $1.7 million to be paid out at $100,000 over 17 months beginning in April 2024 in exchange for unfulfilled\n2023 and 2024 unit purchases.\nIn 2022 we entered into a manufacturing agreements with GLV Ventures (“GLV”) to produce the Grunt and Grunt EVO, as well as the Stag and the Runt and we have\ntransitioned from a manufacturing model in which we manufactured and assembled the Grunt at our manufacturing facility located in Round Rock, Texas, to one where we rely\non this third party manufacturer to build the Grunt EVO, Stag and, if we decide to build the Run, in Mexico.\nAs a result of moving to an outsourced design, development and manufacturing model, we have reduced headcount in all departments to reduce costs. We continue to\nevaluate further cost reductions while developing our sales and marketing team to sell and promote our products to customers in the U.S and to our international distributors.\nWe rely on third party manufacturers, designers and developers, which subjects us to risk of product delivery delays, reduced control over product costs and quality control.\nOur business success will depend in large part on our third party vendors’ ability to economically produce our vehicles at sufficient capacity to meet the demands of\nour customers.\nOur reliance on third parties for the manufacture, design and development of our vehicles exposes us to a number of risks which are outside our control, including:\n· delays due to design and development of our products to meet our product specifications\n· delays due to defective parts or components\n· unexpected increases in manufacturing costs;\n· interruptions in vehicle deliveries if a third party vendor is unable to complete production or design in a timely manner;\n· shipping delays due to availability of ships, trains, trucks or containers to ship products or delays at ports to ship products to us or to our customers; and\n· inability to control the quality of finished products.\n9\nOur reliance on third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing, design and development processes, including reduced control over timing to release products,\nquality, product costs and product supply. We have experienced delays in the design and development of the Stag due to mechanical and electrical components that failed or did\nnot operate as expected. Significant time and development effort was required to address these issues which resulted in significant delays in releasing the Stag. The first Stag\nunit was shipped to a customer in February 2024. We can provide no assurance that we will not realize future delays in production, and until we have multiple manufacturers or\nmanufacture our products internally, our ability to release products on the timeline we expect will be dependent on our current outside manufacturers.\nIf any of our third party vendors suffer interruptions, experience delays in shipments or issues concerning product quality, supply chain or disruptions, including by\nreason of natural disasters, work stoppages or capacity constraints, our ability to ship products to dealers and our international distributors would be delayed. Additionally, if\nany of our third party vendors experience quality control problems in their operations, we could be required to cover the repair or replacement of any defective products. These\ndelays or product quality issues could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill orders and could have a negative impact on our operating results. In\naddition, such delays or issues with product quality could harm our reputation and our relationship with our dealers, distributors and customers.\nOur third party manufacturers may be unable to meet our growing sales and delivery plans, which could harm our business and prospects.\nOur sales growth and delivery plan contemplate achieving and sustaining increases in vehicle deliveries. Our ability to achieve this plan depends upon several factors,\nincluding our ability to identify third party manufacturers who can meet our forecasted demand while maintaining our desired quality levels and optimize design and product\nchanges. Although we believe that the third party manufacturers we have contracted with have the ability to meet our forecasted demand, there is no assurance that they will be\nsuccessful in these efforts. In addition, as we do not have a long-term history of sales, our forecasted demand may be materially incorrect, which could cause us to fail to meet\nunforeseen demand and incur higher costs for excess inventory purchased to meet our forecast. If we are unable to realize our sales and delivery plan, our brand, business,\nprospects, financial condition, and operating results could be materially damaged.\nWe are dependent on our third party manufacturers, who are dependent on their suppliers, some of which could be single-source suppliers. The inability of these suppliers\nto deliver necessary components for our vehicles according to our schedule and at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage\nthese third party manufacturers and their suppliers has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur vehicles contain numerous purchased parts that our third party manufacturers either (a) source globally from direct suppliers, some of whom could be single-\nsource suppliers, or (b) manufacture themselves from components or materials. Any significant unanticipated demand would require our third party manufacturers to procure or\nmanufacture additional components in a short amount of time. While we believe our third party manufacturers would be able to secure additional or alternate sources of supply\nfor most of our components and raw materials in a relatively short time frame, there is no assurance that they will be able to do so or develop their own replacements for certain\nhighly customized components of our products. We have in the past realized production delays due to delays in sourcing certain parts from single-source suppliers. We can\nprovide no assurance that we will not in the future realize additional such delays.\nIf our third party manufacturers encounter unexpected difficulties with key suppliers, and if they are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers, we could\nexperience production delays and potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing, servicing and supporting our vehicles. This limited, and in many\ncases single-source, supply chain exposes our third party manufacturers and us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for the production of our\nvehicles. The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to design changes and delays in product\ndeliveries to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and result in negative publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and a material and\nadverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n10\nOur third party manufacturers operate outside of the U.S., subjecting us to risks of international operations.\nOur third party manufacturers operate outside of the U.S. and as a result we are increasingly exposed to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the U.S.,\nwhich could reduce our revenues or profits, increase our costs, result in significant liabilities or sanctions, or otherwise disrupt our business. These challenges include: (1)\ncompliance with complex and changing laws, regulations and policies of governments that may impact our operations, such as foreign ownership restrictions, import and export\ncontrols, tariffs, and trade restrictions; (2) compliance with U.S. and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad, such as anti-corruption laws, competition laws,\ncurrency regulations, and laws affecting dealings with certain nations; (3) the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries; (4)\nuncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws; and (5) rapid changes in government policy, political or civil unrest, acts of\nterrorism, or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation.\nProducts that we have manufactured for us in Mexico and China may also be subject to any uncertainty of trade relations between such countries and the U. S., which\ncould cause the cost of our products manufactured there to rise, or result in our inability to continue to use third party manufacturers in such country, resulting in a need to find\nalternative sources of manufacture, which could result in the delay of manufacture and supply of our products, increase our cost of manufacture, and cause a delay in our\nshipments to customers and a delay or cancellation of orders. Our future operating results and financial condition could be materially affected to the extent any of these actions\noccur.\nIn addition, the prosecution of intellectual property infringement and trade secret theft outside of the U.S. may be more difficult than in the U.S. Although we take\nprecautions to protect our intellectual property, using our third party manufacturers in Mexico and China could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be\nable to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, and we may be unsuccessful in monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights against them, which\ncould harm our business. We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringers, which could adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. While we take measures to protect our trade secrets, the use of third party manufacturers may also risk disclosure of our innovative and\nproprietary manufacturing methodologies, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are utilizing a small number of vendors to assist us with the manufacturing, development and design of our vehicles, including the chassis, electrical systems, safety\nrequirements, body components and accessories, and the inability of these vendors to complete our respective design requirements may delay our ability to release these\nvehicles for production, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have entered into manufacturing, design and development agreements with vendors with experience in the manufacturing, design and development of two-wheel\nand four-wheel off-road vehicles to assist us with the development of certain aspects of and manufacturing of our vehicles. Although these vendors have successfully assisted\nother companies with manufacture, design and development of vehicles, they may not be able to successfully design, develop and manufacture our vehicles. These vendors may\nexperience delays in fulfilling their obligations under these contracts due to the inability to source parts from other vendors, lack of employees available to work on our projects\ndue to labor shortages or other competing projects from other customers or COVID-19-related issues impacting employees. Failure of these vendors to complete the contracted\ndesign, development and manufacture projects for our vehicles will result in delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and delay production and release of the vehicles for sale,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition.\nIncreases in costs, disruption of supply, or shortage of materials could harm our business.\nOur third party manufacturers may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials. Any such increase, supply\ninterruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. The prices for these materials fluctuate, and\ntheir available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased production of electric vehicle\n(EV) products by our competitors, and could adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks relating to battery packs.\n11\nThese risks include:\n· an increase in the cost, or decrease in the available supply, of materials used in the battery packs;\n· disruption in the supply of battery packs due to quality issues or recalls by battery cell manufacturers;\n· sanctions imposed by the U.S. on countries in which our products are manufactured or where parts are manufactured for our third party manufacturers; and\n· tariffs on the products we source in China.\nOur business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells, including\nthose caused by the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine and sanctions imposed on Russia noted below, could disrupt production of our vehicles. Substantial increases in\nthe prices charged to us, such as those charged by battery cell suppliers, would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased\ncosts through increased selling prices of our vehicles. Any attempts to increase prices in response to increased material costs could result in the cancellation of vehicle orders\nand therefore materially and adversely affect our brand, image, business, prospects and operating results.\nWe have and could continue to experience delays and other complications in the design, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our vehicles and our future planned\nvehicles, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have encountered unanticipated challenges, such as supply chain constraints, that led to initial delays in producing our vehicles. We have experienced longer lead\ntimes with certain suppliers to obtain parts, especially those imported where shipping delays from outbound and inbound ports have caused delays or required us to use air\nfreight and incur higher shipping costs. We have outsourced the manufacturing of all of our vehicles and plan to outsource all manufacturing of our vehicles for the foreseeable\nfuture. We also reduced headcount in all our departments, as we have outsourced the design and development of our vehicles. Any significant delay or other complications in\nthe production of our vehicles or the development, manufacture, and production ramp of our future vehicles, including complications associated with our third party\nmanufacturers’ supply chains or obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals, and/or coronavirus impacts, could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nWe are an early-stage company and we have delivered a limited number of vehicles to customers.\nWe have delivered a limited number of vehicles to customers and we have no meaningful historical financial data upon which we may base our projected revenue and\noperating expenses. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our products or prospective operations and business prospects. We are\nsubject to all the risks inherent in business development, financing, unexpected expenditures, and complications and delays that often occur in a new business. Investors should\nevaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be\nsuccessful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.\nThe conflict with Russia and the Ukraine could have an impact on the availability of components used in the manufacturing of lithium ion batteries that we use to power\nour vehicles.\nThe recent conflict between Russia and the Ukraine could impact the availability of nickel, an element used in the production of lithium ion cells used in batteries that\npower our vehicles. According to the Wall Street Journal, Russia produces 5%-6% of the world’s nickel supply and 17% of the high purity nickel production. The shortage of\nthese cells could have an impact on our ability to produce vehicles to meet our customers’ demands. In addition, sanctions against Russia could impact the price of elements,\nincluding nickel, that are used in the production of batteries which would result in higher costs to produce our vehicles. These sanctions have also impacted the U.S. and global\neconomy and could result in an economic recession which could cause a broader disruption to the Company’s supply chain and distribution network and customer demand for\nour products. These factors would have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\n12\nWe are currently taking orders for the Brat Ebike, Grunt EVO and Volcon Youth motorcycles and the Stag UTV, and if these vehicles fail to perform as expected, our\nreputation could be harmed and our ability to develop, market and sell our vehicles could be harmed.\nIf our vehicles were to contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair or take longer than expected to\ndeliver, our ability to develop, market and sell our vehicles could be harmed. While we intend to perform internal testing on the vehicles, as a start-up company our frame of\nreference by which to evaluate detailed long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics of our vehicles is based on industry metrics rather than\nhistorical data. Although we have procedures to test all of our vehicles for defects, there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix all defects in our products\nprior to their sale to consumers. Any product defects, delays, or other failure of our products to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays,\nproduct recalls, product liability claims, significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating\nresults and prospects.\nWe may not succeed in establishing, maintaining and strengthening our brand, which could materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our products, which\ncould in turn materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business and prospects heavily depend on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Volcon brand. If we are unable to establish, maintain and strengthen\nour brand, we may lose the opportunity to build and maintain a critical mass of customers. Our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen our brand will depend heavily on the\nsuccess of our marketing efforts. Failure to develop and maintain a strong brand would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicles, could result in\nsuppliers and other third parties being less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us, and could materially adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nAn adverse determination in any significant product liability claim against us could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe development, production, marketing, sale and usage of our vehicles will expose us to significant risks associated with product liability claims. The powersports\nvehicles industry in particular is vulnerable to significant product liability claims, and we may face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform\nor are claimed to not have performed as expected. If our products are defective, malfunction or are used incorrectly by our customers, it may result in bodily injury, property\ndamage or other injury, including death, which could give rise to product liability claims against us. Any losses that we may suffer from any liability claims and the effect that\nany product liability litigation may have upon the brand image, reputation and marketability of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations or financial condition. No assurance can be given that material product liability claims will not be made in the future against us, or that claims will not arise in the\nfuture in excess or outside of our insurance coverage and contractual indemnities with suppliers and manufacturers. We believe we have adequate product liability insurance;\nhowever, as we release new products and expand our sales channels, we may not be able to obtain adequate product liability insurance or the cost of doing so may be\nprohibitive. Adverse determinations of material product liability claims made against us could also harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe markets in which we operate are in their infancy and highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries as the industry further\ndevelops. We currently face competition from new and established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from\ncompanies with new technology.\nThe EV market is in its infancy, and we expect it will become more competitive in the future. There is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the\nrespective markets in which they compete. A significant and growing number of established and new companies have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the EV\nmarket, including the off-road market that we intend to pursue. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing,\nmarketing, sales networks, and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale\nand support of their products. Increased competition could result in lower vehicle sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which\ncould harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\n13\nWe may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs.\nOthers, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to\nmake, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, the holders of such\nintellectual property rights may assert their rights and may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights. In addition, if we are determined to have\ninfringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making, selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the\nproducts we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license royalties, to redesign our products, and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products.\nWe have registrations for the trademarks VOLCON and GRUNT in the U.S. We have also applied to register additional trademarks – including VOLCON, VOLCON\nBRAT, VOLCON STAG, GRUNT EVO, EMPOWERING ADVENTURE, RUNT, VOLCON RUNT, STAG, and VOLCON STAG - in the U.S., Canada, New Zealand,\nAustralia and certain additional countries in Latin America, and many of these trademarks are now allowed or registered in these countries. We have resolved some conflicts\nand potential conflicts that have arisen with regard to the use and registration of our trademarks through coexistence agreements and the submission of arguments. We have\nreceived notice from an entity in Brazil who has opposed our applications for trademarks including the word VOLCON, but we believe the trademarks and the goods being sold\nunder them are not similar and there is no potential for confusion.\nWe have also identified that in Australia, VOLCON is similar to another trademark that does not appear to be in use. We have filed a removal application to remove the\nuse of the other trademark so that we can use VOLCON. However, there is no guarantee that our application to remove will be accepted. Our efforts to secure trademark\nregistrations for VOLCON and other trademarks referenced above are ongoing and we may encounter resistance from other companies, particularly as we expand into\nadditional territories. If we receive objections from other entities and are unsuccessful in obtaining agreements or otherwise resolving the matters with these entities, we will\nneed to consider the use of different trademarks for our Company and our products.\nIn the event that we were required to take one or more such actions, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely\naffected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention.\nPotential tariffs or a global trade war could increase our costs and could further increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our\nproducts and our financial results.\nThe Grunt EVO, Runt LT (if we decide to begin production) Brat depend on materials from China, namely batteries, which are among the main components of our\nvehicles. In addition, components for the Stag, mainly wiring harnesses, are also sourced from China. We cannot predict what actions may be taken with respect to tariffs or\ntrade relations between the U.S. and China, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by China in retaliation. The adoption and expansion of\ntrade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs, trade agreements or related policies have the potential to adversely impact our\nsupply chain and access to equipment, our costs and our product margins. Any such cost increases or decreases in availability could slow our growth and cause our financial\nresults and operational metrics to suffer.\nWe primarily sell our vehicles and accessories through a network of third parties, and there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully build out this network.\nAs of March 15, 2024, we have 103 active dealers to sell our vehicles and accessories. In 2022 we hired our first regional sales manager in Canada to begin developing\nour dealer network for Canadian powersports vehicle dealers but in 2023 we determined we would defer selling our products in Canada and as of December 31, 2023 and we no\nlonger have any Canadian employees.\n14\nWe are required to comply with manufacture/dealer laws in each state in which we sell our vehicles through dealers. Dealer laws vary by state and although our dealer\nagreements are intended to comply with these laws, we may be required to amend our agreements if these laws are changed or are challenged by dealers or other OEMs. Our\ndealer and distribution agreements are generally short-term in nature and the dealer, distributor or we may cancel these agreements under certain circumstances and we may not\nbe able to retain or expand the scope of our dealer and/or distribution network in the future.\nWe have entered into an accounts receivable factoring arrangement to allow the Company the ability to generate cash for working capital. We will incur financing\ncosts under this arrangement. On a longer term basis we intend to obtain a “flooring” financing arrangement to allow financing sources for our dealers to purchase vehicle\ninventory. We may incur costs to incentivize dealers to buy our vehicles including free dealer financing for certain periods or based on purchase volumes, interest rate\nbuydowns on the dealers’ customer financing to incentivize their customers’ purchase of our vehicles. Because we are a young company with limited sales history and recurring\nlosses, we may not be able to obtain these inventory financing sources which may result in dealers not wanting to sell our vehicles.\nIn the U.S., we began to sell the Brat and Volcon youth motorcycles on our website in 2023, in addition to our dealer network and bicycle retailers. Customers can\nrequest that these vehicles be delivered to a local Volcon dealer or directly to a location they can designate. We do not intend to compete with dealers who sell these products\nand we provide for price protection to them in the event we are selling these products below the retail price they are selling them for in order for them to maintain their margin.\nWe also sell our vehicles and accessories internationally through international distributors. As of December 31, 2023, we have signed distribution agreements with six\ndistributors in Latin America, one distributor in New Zealand and one distributor in the Caribbean region and in January 2024 we signed an agreement with a distributor in\nAustralia. We are relying on these distributors to market, promote, sell and service our vehicles and sell accessories in their designated countries/territories.\nWe believe our success will be highly dependent on our ability to build out this network in the major markets in which we intend to compete for customers, and to\nmaintain this network in the future. Our business model is dependent not only on our ability to create the foregoing network, but also on the commitment and motivation of\nthese third parties to promote our brand and products.\nOrders for vehicles are cancelable and there can be no assurance that all orders will result in revenue being recognized.\nOrders from U.S. dealers do not require an upfront payment and are cancelable prior to shipment with no penalty. Orders from U.S. consumers for the Stag required a\nminimal reservation fee and all orders are cancelable prior to shipment, although the reservation fee is forfeited unless it must be refunded in accordance with state laws. Most\nimporters must pay for orders in advance of shipment but can cancel an order prior to shipment and receive a refund without penalty.\nThe estimated fulfillment of all orders we have received assumes our third party manufacturers can successfully increase their production capacity in the future, of\nwhich there is no assurance. If we are unable to satisfy pending orders on a timely basis, customers may cancel their orders.\nIn some cases, there will be significant time between a customer ordering a vehicle and the eventual delivery of the vehicle, which creates a heightened risk that a\ncustomer that ordered a vehicle may change his or her mind and not ultimately take delivery of the vehicle, and accessories, if purchased, in their order. Any cancellations could\nharm our financial condition, business, prospects and operating results.\n15\nWe may be unable to improve our existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and preferences and achieve market acceptance.\nWe may not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers, unless we can successfully\nenhance current products, develop new innovative products, maintain or lower product costs and distinguish our products from our competitors’ products through innovation\nand design. Product development requires significant financial, technological, and other resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to incur a level of investment\nin research and development that will be sufficient to successfully make us competitive in product innovation and design. In addition, even if we are able to successfully\nenhance existing products and develop new products, there is no guarantee that the markets for our existing products and new products will progress as anticipated. If any of the\nmarkets in which our existing products compete do not develop as expected, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have limited experience servicing our vehicles, we intend to primarily utilize third parties to service our vehicles, and if we are unable to address the service\nrequirements of our customers, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have limited experience servicing or repairing our vehicles and we are developing our service manuals and service procedures to repair our vehicles. We are in the\nprocess of developing a network of service providers who will also be our dealers as many states require that only dealers can provide warranty service on vehicles. For our\ninternational distributors, they will be service providers or will identify third parties who will be service providers to service our vehicles.\nServicing electric vehicles is different from servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and\nservicing techniques. If we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our customers, our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected. If\nwe are unable to successfully address the servicing requirements of our customers or establish a market perception that we maintain high-quality support, our reputation could\nbe harmed, we may be subject to claims from our customers, and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nSignificant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations or financial condition.\nWe provide a one-year warranty against defects for the Grunt EVO, Brat and Volcon youth motorcycles and a two-year warranty on the battery. The manufacturers of\nthe Brat and Volcon youth motorcycles provide the warranty for these products and we are reimbursed for warranty claims provided we obtain approval of the claim from the\nmanufacturer.\nWe currently expect to provide a similar warranty the Runt LT when it is released for sale. Our warranty for the Stag is also one-year against defects and two years for\nthe batteries. Our warranty will generally require us to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Some of the parts are\nwarrantied by the part manufacturer where others are no. We record provisions based on an estimate of product warranty claims, but there is the possibility that actual claims\nmay exceed these provisions and therefore negatively impact our results of operations of financial condition.\nIn addition, we may in the future be required to make product recalls or could be held liable in the event that some of our products do not meet safety standards or\nstatutory requirements on product safety, even if the defects related to any such recall or liability are not covered by our limited warranty. The repair and replacement costs that\nwe could incur in connection with a recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Product recalls could also harm our\nreputation and cause us to lose customers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n16\nOur success is dependent upon the success of the off-road vehicle industry and upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles.\nOur success is dependent upon the success of the off-road vehicle industry as a whole, and in particular upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles as an\nalternative to combustion vehicles. If the market for electric off-road vehicles does not develop at the rate or in the manner or to the extent that we expect, our business, results\nof operations or financial condition may be adversely materially affected. The market for electric vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing\ntechnologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standard, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer\ndemands and behaviors. Factors that may influence the adoption of electric vehicles include:\n· perceptions about electric vehicle quality, safety, design, performance and costs;\n· the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and the decline of an electric vehicle’s range resulting from deterioration\nover time in the battery’s ability to hold a charge;\n· the ability to easily charge electric vehicles\n· volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline, and improvements in the fuel economy of combustion engines; and\n· the environmental consciousness of off-road vehicles customers.\nThe influence of any of the factors described above may cause our customers not to purchase our vehicles and may otherwise materially adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nHigher inflation and interest rates, volatile financial markets, unemployment and consumer confidence may cause consumers to defer or not purchase our products.\nGlobally inflation and interest rates rose in 2023 compared to 2022 and could continue to rise or remain at current levels in the future. Our vehicles represent a\ndiscretionary purchase. Many consumers finance the purchase of an off-road vehicle and higher interest rates will result in higher monthly payments which some consumers\nmay not qualify for or consumers may elect to defer their purchase until interest rates decline.\nIn addition, global financial markets overall have seen significant volatility in 2023 and could continue to experience volatility in the future and could decline. A\nnumber of large companies have announced layoffs. Public companies in the EV sector have seen significant declines and volatility in 2023. Consumer confidence in the U.S.\nhas declined.\nThe influence of any of the factors described above may cause our customers not to purchase our vehicles and may otherwise materially adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nWe currently operate in an area of the vehicle sector that is not heavily regulated, and future changes in government oversight may subject us to increased regulations,\nwhich may increase our expenses.\nThe off-road vehicle market is not heavily regulated, as compared to on-road vehicles, and, as such, we are not currently subject to significant government regulations.\nAs this market develops and grows, it may come under increased regulatory scrutiny, which may result in increased regulations. This increase in regulations may result in\nincreased costs and expenses, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n17\nWe could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity attacks and are subject to evolving privacy laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions that could adversely impact our\nbusiness and require that we incur substantial costs.\nWe use a variety of information technology systems in the ordinary course of business, which are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses,\nransomware software viruses and other similar types of malicious activities and cyber-attacks, including cyber-attacks to our information technology infrastructure and attempts\nby others to gain access to our proprietary or sensitive information, and ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats. Additionally, our vendors and\npotentially our customers, such as federal, state and local governments, require us to maintain and protect our information technology infrastructure to specified standards in\norder to protect not only our sensitive information, but also their sensitive information. Further, ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe. To\nalleviate the financial, operational, and reputational impact of a ransomware attack, it may be preferable to make extortion payments, but we may be unwilling or unable to do\nso, including, for example, if applicable laws or regulations prohibit such payments. The procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure may\nnot be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity incidents. The results of these incidents could include misstated financial data, theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property,\nliability for disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee information, increased costs arising from the implementation of additional security protective measures,\nlitigation and reputational damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business or results of operations. Any remedial costs or other liabilities\nrelated to cybersecurity incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Moreover, we or our third party vendors or business partners may be more vulnerable\nto such attacks in remote work environments, which have increased in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, security breaches could result in a violation of\napplicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws and subject us to governmental investigations and proceedings, which could result in our exposure to material civil or\ncriminal liability.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nIn March 2024, we exchanged our outstanding convertible notes for Preferred Stock and a significant number of shares of common stock could be issued upon conversion.\nIn March 2024, we issued Series A Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) at $1,000 per share in exchange for $24.7 million principal of convertible notes. The initial\nconversion price for the Preferred Stock is $1.33 and is convertible at any time. On March 5, 2024, certain holders of the Preferred Stock converted approximately $2.3 million\nfor approximately 1.7 million shares of common stock. The total number of shares of common stock that could be issued as of March 27, 2024 for the outstanding Preferred\nStock on this date is approximately 16.8 million shares. The conversion price of the Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment if certain events such as a stock split, reverse stock\nsplit, or stock dividend occurs, or if we issue equity or convertible instruments at offering prices below the conversion price. In addition, in the event of a change of control or\nsale of substantially all of the Company’s assets, the Preferred Stock agreement provides for distributions that are either based on the number of common stock shares issuable\nunder these agreements or based on other valuations as defined in the agreement.\nThe Preferred Stock holders may resell all, or some of the shares of common stock underlying the Preferred Stock after conversion, at any time or from time to time at\ntheir discretion. Resales of our common stock may cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly, regardless of the performance of our business. The adjustment\nof the conversion price for the Preferred Stock held by these investors based on the price of future issuances of securities could also limit our ability to raise capital as potential\ninvestors may not make an investment in a new issuance of securities if their investment could be immediately diluted due to adjustments in the conversion price or warrant\nexercise prices.\n18\nWe have issued Series B warrants in connection with the public offering completed in November 2023 that have provisions that can increase the number of warrants and\nreduce the exercise price if we complete certain transactions.\nOur public offering completed in November 2023 included Series A and Series B warrants (“Series A Warrants” and “Series B Warrants”) to purchase our common\nstock with initial exercise prices of $24.75 and $37.80, respectively. As of March 27, 2023, approximately 42,000 and 14.5 million Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants,\nrespectively, remain outstanding and the Series A Warrants have an exercise price of $1.8636 and the Series B Warrants have an exercise price of $0.9059. Series A Warrants\nmay be exercised on an alternative cash basis where each warrant exercised will result in the Company issuing three shares of common stock.\nThe Series B Warrants provide, subject to certain exemptions, that if we sell or issue, any common stock or convertible securities, at an effective price per share less\nthan the exercise price of the Series B Warrant then in effect, or a Dilutive Issuance, the exercise price of the Series B Warrant will be reduced to an amount equal to the lowest\ndaily volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) during the period commencing five consecutive trading days following the Dilutive Issuance and the number of shares issuable\nupon exercise of the Series B Warrant shall be proportionally adjusted so that the aggregate exercise price of the Series B Warrant shall remain unchanged.\nFurther, if at any time on or after the date of issuance there occurs any share split, share dividend, share combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction\ninvolving our common stock and the lowest daily VWAP during the five consecutive trading days prior to the date of such event and the five consecutive trading days after the\ndate of such event is less than the exercise price then in effect, then the exercise price shall be reduced to the lowest daily VWAP during such period and the number of warrant\nshares issuable shall be increased such that the aggregate exercise price payable thereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the exercise price, shall be equal to the\naggregate exercise price on the date of issuance.\nAs a result of the 1 for 45 reverse stock split we completed on February 5, 2024, the exercise price of approximately 15.8 million Series B Warrants were reset to\n$1.8646 based on the lowest VWAP over the course of the five day trading period through February 12, 2024 and the new amount of Series B Warrants as of this date became\napproximately 7.1 million.\nAs a result of the exchange of the Convertible Notes for Preferred Stock (convertible at $1.33 per share of common stock) in March 2024 noted above, the exercise\nprice of the Series B warrants adjusted to $0.91 per share based on the lowest VWAP in the five day trading period through March 12, 2024 and the total number of Series B\nWarrants adjusted to approximately 14.5 million.\nFurther adjustments to the Series B Warrant exercise price and number of warrants may occur if we complete any additional transactions or complete another reverse\nstock split per the terms of the Series B Warrants.\nAlthough some of the holders of Series A and Series B Warrants have ownership limitations, if and when we do issue shares of common stock to holders of the Series\nA Warrants and Series B Warrants upon the exercise by the holder, such stockholders may resell all, some or none of those shares of common stock at any time or from time to\ntime at their discretion. Resales of our common stock may cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly, regardless of the performance of our business.\n19\nYour ownership may be diluted if additional capital stock is issued to raise capital, to finance our operations, to complete acquisitions or in connection with strategic\ntransactions.\nWe will need to raise additional funds to finance our operations, to complete acquisitions or to develop strategic relationships by issuing equity or convertible debt\nsecurities, which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, to\nissue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 250,000,000 shares of\ncommon stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Future issuances of common or preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote\nand would be dilutive to earnings per share. In addition, any newly issued preferred stock could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the common stock.\nThose rights, preferences and privileges could include, among other things, the establishment of dividends that must be paid prior to declaring or paying dividends or other\ndistributions to holders of our common stock or providing for preferential liquidation rights. These rights, preferences and privileges could negatively affect the rights of\nholders of our common stock, and the right to convert such preferred stock into shares of our common stock at a rate or price that would have a dilutive effect on the\noutstanding shares of our common stock.\nIf our stock price fluctuates, you could lose a significant part of your investment.\nSince our initial public offering through March 27, 2024 our share price has fluctuated from a high of $3,933.00 to a low of $0.565, (as adjusted for the 1 for 5 and 1\nfor 45 reverse stock splits completed in October 2023 and February 2024, respectively) and closed at $0.68 on March 27, 2024. The market price of our common stock is\nsubject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this filing and other factors beyond our control, such as fluctuations in the valuation\nof companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us. Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to\naffect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those\ncompanies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes or international\ncurrency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their\nstock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial\ncosts and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nWe are party to certain agreements with a founder of the Company and certain executive officers that may create a conflict of interest for our board of directors in\nevaluating a potential change of control transaction.\nWe had previously entered into a consulting agreement Highbridge Consultants, LLC (“Highbridge”), an entity controlled by Mr. Adrian James, who is a former\nmember of our board of directors and current stockholder, pursuant to which Mr. James would provide us with services. Pursuant to the consulting agreements, upon the\noccurrence of a Fundamental Transaction (as contemplated by such agreement), which generally includes a business combination, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of\nour assets (or similar events), for an aggregate gross sales price of $100.0 million or more, Highbridge will receive a cash payment equal to 1% of such gross sales price. This\npayment upon the consummation of a Fundamental Transaction may make our company less attractive to a potential acquirer or may reduce the valuation we receive in\nconnection with a Fundamental Transaction.\nFurthermore, if our market capitalization exceeds $300.0 million for a period of 21 consecutive trading days, Highbridge will receive an additional cash payment equal\nto $15.0 million; provided that we will have the right, in our sole discretion, to make the foregoing $15.0 million payment by the issuance of shares of our common stock. If we\nelect to make any payments to the entities in the form of stock, it would reduce the ownership percentage of our other stockholders.\n20\nIn January 2024, the Company entered into an employment agreement with John Kim, a member of the board of directors of the Company, to become the Company’s\nCEO and President. Also in January 2024, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Greg Endo, the Company’s CFO and Executive Vice President. As part of\nthe employment agreements with Mr. Kim and Mr. Endo, they are each entitled to a payment of 5% of the gross proceeds from any merger, sale or change of control transaction\n(as determined by the board of directors) entered by the Company for a period of up to 6 months after termination of employment; provided that they are not terminated for\nCause (as defined in the employment agreement).\nIn March 2024, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Christian Okonsky, a founder of the Company, chairman of the board of directors and former\nChief Technology Officer. As part of the consulting agreement Mr. Okonsky is entitled to a payment of 1% of the gross proceeds from any merger, sale or change of control\ntransaction (as determined by the board of directors) entered by the Company for a period of up to 6 months following the termination of the consulting agreement.\nThese change of control payments may create a conflict of interest for these directors and officers in evaluating any future change of control transactions.\nIf we agree to complete additional warrant inducements to the holders of warrants issued in in our August 2022 and May 2023 convertible note offerings (the “Investors”),\nwe may reduce the exercise price of warrants held by Investors and we may issue additional warrants to the Investors to replace some or all of the warrants that were\nexercised.\nIn September and October 2023, in an effort to raise cash, we entered into warrant inducement agreements with certain investors where we reduced the exercise price\nof certain warrants to induce them to these exercise warrants.\nTo the extent we complete similar warrant inducements in the future, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nPayment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements,\nrestrictions contained in any financing instruments, provisions of applicable law and other factors the board deems relevant.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock, then our\nstock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our industry and our market. If\nno analyst elects to cover us and publish research or reports about us, the market for our common stock could be severely limited and our stock price could be adversely\naffected. As a small-cap company, we are more likely than our larger competitors to lack coverage from securities analysts. In addition, even if we receive analyst coverage, if\none or more analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price\nor trading volume to decline. If one or more analysts who elect to cover us issue negative reports or adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock, our\nstock price could decline.\n21\nIf we fail to satisfy all applicable continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could have an\nadverse impact on the liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing\nrequirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders’ equity, minimum bid price, and\ncertain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the applicable listing standards.\nOn July 5, 2023, we received a notice from Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(b)(2), which requires that we maintain a market\nvalue of listed securities (“MVLS”) of $35 million. MVLS is calculated by multiplying our shares outstanding by the closing price of our common stock. On July 6, 2023, we\nreceived a notice from Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), (the “Bid Price Rule”) as the minimum bid price of our common stock\nhad been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. On October 30, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq that it has now regained compliance with\nRule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of its common stock was above $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days.\nOn December 19, 2023, the Company received a notice from the Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), (the “Bid Price\nRule”) as the minimum bid price of our common stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days.\nOn December 26, 2023, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that we that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) as the closing bid\nprice of our common stock had been below $0.10 for ten consecutive trading days from December 11, 2023 through December 22, 2023 (the “Low Priced Stocks Rule”) and\nwas subject to delisting on January 2, 2024. On January 4, 2024 we received notice from Nasdaq that we did not meet the MVLS requirement and we were subject to delisting.\nThe Company submitted a hearing request to Nasdaq’s Hearings Department for both of these matters, which stayed the suspension of the Company’s common stock. We\nparticipated in the hearing on March 26, 2024 and we were informed that we may be provided with a decision two weeks from this date, although the timing of the decision is\nat the discretion of Nasdaq.\nIn the event that our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock\ncould be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board.\nIn such an event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our\ncoverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional\ncapital if we are not listed on a major exchange.\nIn an effort to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules, we completed a reverse stock split on October 13, 2023 and a reverse stock split on February 5, 2024. We\ncannot predict whether we will need to complete an additional reverse stock split and the effect that such reverse stock split will have on the market price for shares of our\ncommon stock.\nAs noted in the risk factor above, we were out of compliance with the Bid Price Rule and the Low Priced Stocks Rule in December 2023. In an effort to regain\ncompliance with these rules our board of directors authorized a reverse stock split of one for forty-five (1 for 45) on January 27, 2024 and we completed the reverse stock split\non February 5, 2024. The Company’s stock price as of March 27, 2024 is below $1.00 and we may complete another reverse stock split before June 17, 2024 in order to regain\ncompliance with the Bid Price Rule.\nWe cannot predict the effect that the reverse stock split will have on the market price for shares of our common stock, and the history of previous reverse stock splits\nhas not resulted in our share price remaining above $1.00. Some investors may have a negative view of a reverse stock split. Even if the reverse stock split has a positive effect\non the market price for shares of our common stock, performance of our business and financial results, general economic conditions and the market perception of our business,\nand other adverse factors which may not be in our control could lead to a decrease in the price of our common stock following the reverse stock split.\n22\nFurthermore, even if the reverse stock split does result in an increased market price per share of our common stock, the market price per share following the reverse\nstock split may not increase in proportion to the reduction of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding before the implementation of the reverse stock split.\nAccordingly, even with an increased market price per share, the total market capitalization of shares of our common stock after a reverse stock split could be lower than the\ntotal market capitalization before the reverse stock split. Also, even if there is an initial increase in the market price per share of our common stock after a reverse stock split,\nthe market price may not remain at that level.\nIf the market price of shares of our common stock declines following the reverse stock split, the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of our\noverall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of the reverse stock split due to decreased liquidity in the market for our common stock.\nAccordingly, the total market capitalization of our common stock following the reverse stock split could be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock\nsplit.\nIf we complete a reverse stock split, the conversion price of our Preferred Stock and some of our outstanding warrants will adjust and some of the warrants will be\nadjusted to increase the number of warrants outstanding which will result in additional dilution to shareholders.\nAs an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain\ndisclosure requirements.\nAs an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. We are an\nemerging growth company until the earliest of:\n· the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.235 billion or more;\n· the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering;\n· the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or\n· the date on which we are deemed a “large accelerated issuer” as defined under the federal securities laws.\nFor so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:\n· have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n· comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to\nthe auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis);\n· submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholders advisory votes pursuant to the “say on frequency” and “say on pay” provisions (requiring a non-\nbinding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the “say on golden parachute” provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder\nvote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010; and\n· include detailed compensation discussion and analysis in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and instead may provide a reduced\nlevel of disclosure concerning executive compensation.\nAdditionally, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we:\n· may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations, or MD&A; and\n· are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act.\n23\nWe intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, other than the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised\nfinancial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act.\nCertain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a “smaller reporting company”\nunder SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management’s assessment of internal control\nover financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio\ndisclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have established policies and procedures for assessing, identifying, and managing material risk from cybersecurity threats. We monitor cybersecurity threats,\nincluding any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through our information systems that we use through third party providers that may result in adverse effects on\nthe confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems or any information residing therein.\nWe conducted a NIST risk assessment and perform as needed updates to our risks to identify cybersecurity threats, as well as assessments in the event of a material\nchange in our business practices that may affect information systems that are vulnerable to such cybersecurity threats. We engage a managed service provider (“MSP”) and\nother third parties in connection with our cybersecurity and information technology risk assessment processes and our MSP also assists us with managing and monitoring our\nnetwork and local compute systems. These service providers assist us in designing and implementing our cybersecurity policies and procedures, as well as monitoring and\ntesting our safeguards. Personnel at all levels and departments are made aware of our cybersecurity policies through communications.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and through the date of the filing of this report, we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For additional information regarding risks from\ncybersecurity threats, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Annual report on Form 10-K.\nGovernance\nOne of the key responsibilities of our board of directors is informed oversight of our risk management process, including risks from cybersecurity threats. Our board of\ndirectors is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, and our executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day management of the material risks we\nface.\nOur Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) is primarily responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats.\nIn this regard, our CFO has assistance from service providers, other consultants and third parties. Our CFO has served as an executive officer for three years and prior to this\nwas an audit and advisory partner at a public accounting firm overseeing financial statement audits of public and private companies. Audit procedures performed for his clients\nincluded evaluating internal controls and risk assessment evaluations over information technology and cybersecurity policies.\nOur CFO oversees our cybersecurity policies and procedures, including those described in “Risk Management and Strategy” above. Under such policies and\nprocedures, our CFO is responsible for reporting to our board of directors regarding any cybersecurity incident including the results of cybersecurity risk assessments.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur corporate headquarters is located in Round Rock, Texas, where we currently lease approximately 23,300 square feet of space across three facilities.\nWe believe that our existing space is adequate for our current operations. We believe that suitable replacement and additional space, if necessary, will be available in\nthe future on commercially reasonable terms.\n24\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The results of\nlitigation are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of\nmanagement time and result in diversion of significant resources. We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses for those legal matters\nfor which losses are not probable and estimable. We have insurance policies covering potential losses where such coverage is cost effective.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\n25\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol “VLCN”.\nHolders\nAs of March 26, 2024, we had 1,159 stockholders of record and 18,748,955 outstanding shares.\nDividends\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. The payment of dividends in the future will be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if\nany, capital requirements and general financial condition. We currently intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. We do not\nexpect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will\ndepend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in any financing instruments, provisions of applicable law and other factors\nthe board deems relevant.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nAll information related to equity securities sold by us during the period covered by this report that were not registered under the Securities Act have been included in\nour Form 10-Q filings or in a Form 8-K filing. We did not issue any equity securities during the fourth quarter of 2023 that were not registered under the Securities Act.\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the related\nnotes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those\nset forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an all-electric, off-road powersports vehicle company developing electric two and four-wheel motorcycles and utility terrain vehicles, or UTVs, also known as\nside-by-sides, along with a line of upgrades and accessories. In October 2020, we began building and testing prototypes for our future offerings with two off-road motorcycles –\nthe Grunt and the Runt. Our motorcycles feature unique frame designs protected by design patents. Additional utility and design patents have been filed for other aspects of\nVolcon’s vehicles.\n26\nWe initially began to sell and distribute the Grunt and related accessories in the United States (‘U.S.”) on a direct-to-consumer sales platform. We terminated our Grunt\ndirect-to-consumer sales platform in November 2021. Prior to the termination of our direct-to-consumer sales platform, U.S. consumers made deposits for 360 Grunts (net of\ncancellations) and five Runts, plus accessories and a delivery fee representing total deposits of $2.2 million. These orders were cancelable by the consumer until the vehicle was\ndelivered and after a 14-day acceptance period, therefore the deposits were recorded as deferred revenue. As of June 30, 2022, we had completed shipping of all Grunts sold\nthrough our direct-to-consumer sales platform. Due to delays in developing the Runt, we refunded the deposits made for all Runts.\nBeginning in November 2021, we began negotiating dealership agreements with powersports dealers to display and sell our vehicles and accessories. Customers can\nnow, or will soon be able to, buy our vehicles and accessories directly from a local dealership. Some of these dealers will also provide warranty and repair services to\ncustomers. As of March 15, 2024, we have 103 active dealers. Dealers can order any of our available products provided they are current on their accounts receivable and are\nwithin their established credit limit. We are offering dealers payment terms 30 to 90 days to make larger purchases of our vehicles. We have entered into an accounts receivable\nfactoring arrangement to allow the Company the ability to generate cash for working capital. We have agreements with third party financing companies to provide financing to\nqualified customers of each dealer. There is no recourse to the Company or the dealer if the dealer’s customer defaults on the financing agreement with the third party.\nWe sell our vehicles internationally through importers. Each importer buys vehicles by the container and sells vehicles and accessories to local dealers or directly to\nconsumers. Local dealers or the importer will provide warranty and repair services for vehicles purchased in their country. In October 2023, the Company made a decision to\npostpone expanding our dealer network in Canada for the foreseeable future and we have terminated the employment of our Canadian regional sales managers. As of March 15,\n2024, we have signed agreements with six importers in Latin America, one importer for the Caribbean Region, collectively referred to herein as the LATAM importers, one\nimporter in New Zealand, and one importer in Australia to sell our vehicles and accessories in their assigned countries/markets. In 2024, we expect to expand our global sales of\nour vehicles and accessories beyond our current distributor base.\nIn June 2022, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Torrot Electric Europa S.A., referred to herein as Torrot, to distribute their electric motorcycles for\nyouth riders in Latin America. In October 2022, we signed an expanded agreement with Torrot, which superseded the June 2022 agreement, to also be the exclusive distributor\nof Torrot and Volcon co-branded youth electric motorcycles in the U.S. as well as Latin America. Finally, in December 2022, we signed an expanded agreement with Torrot to\nbe the exclusive distributor of Volcon co-branded youth electric motorcycles in Canada. In June 2023, we wrote down all remaining Torrot branded inventory in the amount of\n$84,000. In December 2023 we notified Torrot that we were terminating our agreements due to continued lower than expected sales at significantly discounted pricing. In 2023,\nwe wrote down the Volcon co-branded Torrot youth motorcycles by $2,674,352 to reduce their cost to the estimated net realizable value due to lower than expected sales. We\nhave agreed to give Torrot a total of 1,000 Volcon branded Torrot motorcycles originally purchased for $1.8 million, an upfront payment of $370,000 and an additional $1.7\nmillion to be paid out at $100,000 over 17 months beginning in April 2024 in exchange for unfulfilled 2023 and 2024 unit purchases. As of December 31, 2023, we have\nVolcon Youth inventory of approximately $239,935, after reducing these to the estimated net realizable value, of Volcon branded Torrot motorcycles and accessories which we\nintend to liquidate and we have agreed to give Torrot sales rights in the U.S., Canada and LATAM after June 30, 2024.\nIn July 2022, we expanded our offerings with the introduction of the first of our Volcon UTV models, the Stag, which we initially anticipated would be available for\ndelivery to customers in the fourth quarter of 2023, followed by additional models of the Stag expected in 2024 and 2025. Due to a delay in certain parts from third party\nvendors, we expect delivery to customers to begin in the first quarter of 2024. The Stag is being manufactured by a third party and incorporates electrification units, which\ninclude batteries, drive units and control modules provided by General Motors. Beginning in June 2022, we took non-binding pre-production orders which are cancelable prior\nto delivery. In the third quarter of 2023 we canceled all of the original pre-production orders due to the introduction of multiple models and new pricing. We began taking new\npre-production orders for the newly introduced models in the third quarter of 2023. We also expect to introduce a higher performance, longer range UTV (to be named) but\ndevelopment of this vehicle has not yet begun and no timeline for its development and release has been determined.\n27\nIn August 2022 we ceased manufacturing of the Grunt and we outsourced the manufacturing of the remaining Grunts and the 2024 Grunt EVO to the same third party\nmanufacturer as the Stag. The 2024 Grunt EVO has replaced the Grunt and has a belt drive rather than a chain drive as well as an updated rear suspension. We began selling the\nGrunt EVO in the third quarter of 2023.\nWe began taking pre-orders for an E-Bike, the Brat, in September 2022 and shipments to customers began in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Brat is being\nmanufactured by a third party. In January 2023, we began selling the Brat directly to consumers through our website. Consumers who order the Brat from our website can have\nthe Brat shipped to their specified destination.\nIn November 2022, we finalized an agreement with the same third party that manufactures the Stag and Grunt EVO to manufacture the Runt LT. We received\nprototypes of the Runt LT in the first quarter of 2023. We are evaluating the market for the Runt LT and will determine whether to proceed with production in the first half of\n2024.\nThe estimated fulfillment of all orders we have received assumes that our third party manufacturers can successfully meet our order quantities and deadlines. If they\nare unable to satisfy orders on a timely basis, our customers may cancel their orders.\nIn September and October 2023, we reduced our headcount in several departments to reduce costs and we continue to evaluate other cost reduction opportunities.\nResults of Operations\nThe following financial information is for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n2023 2022\nRevenue $ 3,260,988 $ 4,546,686\nCost of goods sold 11,391,040 13,412,820\nGross margin (8,130,052) (8,866,134)\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 7,405,705 5,694,556\nProduct development 7,868,985 8,456,157\nGeneral and administrative 6,388,007 9,046,778\nTotal operating expenses 21,662,697 23,197,491\nLoss from operations (29,792,749) (32,063,625)\nInterest and other expense (15,278,462) (2,171,780)\nNet loss $ (45,071,211) $ (34,235,405)\nDue to recurring losses, there is no provision for income taxes for any period presented.\n28\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $3,260,988 which represents sales of Brats of $2,341,097, Grunt EVO motorcycles of $465,438, Grunt\nmotorcycles of $129,117, Volcon Youth and Torrot motorcycles of $498,160 and accessories and parts of $261,663 offset by $436,333 for rebates and dealer discounts.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $4,546,686, which represents sales of Grunts of $3,576,796 and accessories and parts of $250,780. The sales of\nGrunts are offset by promotional rebates and discounts provided to dealers and distributors during 2022 resulting in $930,422 being recorded to reduce revenue. The rebate is\nprovided as a year-end incentive to dealers and distributors to sell their remaining 2022 Model Year Grunt inventory. Revenue of $489,769 and $129,383 represents the sale of\nBrats and Torrot kids motorcycles, respectively.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $11,391,040, including payroll costs of $1,200,098 and stock-based compensation of $211,981 for\nemployees performing warehouse and logistics management and quality control testing. Product costs for Brats, Grunt EVOs, and Volcon Youth motorcycles sold during the\nperiod were $1,674,987, $711,807 and $3,236,773, respectively. We recorded a write down of $2,674,352 for Volcon Youth motorcycles to reduce their costs to the expected net\nrealizable value. We also recorded an expense of $2,070,000 for the termination of the Torrot agreement. We recorded an expense of $450,282 related to fees paid to cancel\npurchase orders to reduce raw material quantities. The Company also recorded an expense of $1,401,490 to write off inventory contributed to our third party manufacturer of\nthe Grunt EVO in return for a credit that would be provided for each unit purchased up to 900 units.\nFacilities costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $509,360 for our warehouse facility and third party warehousing costs. Accrued warranty costs were\n$205,069 offset by a reversal of the accrued warranty liability in the amount of $472,978 for the Grunt where the one year warranty for defects had expired and claims were not\nas high as estimated.\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $13,412,820 including labor costs of $1,740,645 for employees and contractors performing assembly,\nlogistics, quality control testing, and service and warranty of Grunts through August 2022, when assembly of the Grunt was discontinued, and stock-based compensation of\n$344,374 for share-based awards for these employees. Subsequent to August 2022, labor costs of $453,471 relate to employee and contractor costs for logistics, quality control\ntesting and service and warranty, including stock-based compensation of $234,178 for share-based awards for these employees. Total cost of materials for Grunts during the\nyear were $5,460,943 which include parts costs for Grunts sold of $3,814,424, adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory of $460,744 and adjustments to record inventory\nat its net realizable value of $1,692,217. We paid $128,137 for fees owed to cancel purchase orders for Grunt parts to reduce quantities ordered to expected sales demand. Cost\nof goods sold for Brats and Torrot Youth motorcycles, excluding shipping, was $235,160 and $206,596, respectively, this includes a $82,627 write-down for Torrot Youth\ninventory to sell remaining quantities on hand in anticipation of the Volcon Youth branded motorcycles which arrived in the first quarter of 2023.\nFacilities costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $585,114 for our manufacturing facility and inventory warehousing costs. Shipping costs and duties/tariffs\nfor inventory purchases and shipments to customers were $2,627,658 which includes an accrual of $350,000 for costs expected to be incurred to ship our raw materials and\nwork-in-process inventory to our third party manufacturer offset by $242,772 for shipping fees paid by customers. Accrued warranty costs were $575,608. Depreciation\nexpense of $285,564 was recorded in the year and a loss on the write-off of property and equipment of $170,657 was recognized for the disposal of manufacturing assets due to\nthe outsourcing of Grunt assembly.\nIn 2024 we expect revenue and cost of goods sold, other than inventory write downs, Torrot contract termination costs and PO cancellation costs, to increase due to the\nexpected increase in sales of the Grunt EVO and Stag. Additional cost savings may be realized if the third party manufacturer can source or manufacture parts at a lower cost.\nThe increase in costs for products will partially be offset by reductions in cost for salaries and benefits due to reductions in headcount completed in 2023.\n29\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses relate to costs to increase exposure and awareness for our products and developing our network of U.S. dealers and international\ndistributors.\nSales and marketing expenses were $7,405,705 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and were primarily related to expenses associated with promoting our products\nand brand of $2,889,421, employee payroll costs of $2,789,652, stock-based compensation of $693,559 for share-based awards granted to employees and consultants, and\ntravel costs of $294,323 primarily related to costs incurred for travel to build our dealer and distributor network and to attend events to promote our products. Facilities costs\nwere $168,000. Bad debt expense was $105,687 and professional fees in the amount of $201,125, mainly related to legal fees in the amount of $74,090 related to entering into\ninternational distribution agreements and sales consultant fees in the amount of $73,132.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 sales and marketing expenses were $5,694,556 and include $1,636,619 for promoting our products, employee payroll costs of\n$1,949,064, stock-based compensation of $764,517 for share-based awards granted to employees and consultants, $66,625 for professional fees, $356,958 for facilities costs\nprimarily to operate our now closed dealership in Denver, Colorado, including costs of $148,323 for closing this store, and travel costs of $294,878 primarily related to costs\nincurred for travel to build our dealer network.\nWe also expect sales expenses to increase as we begin expanding our international distributors and selling commissions for increased sales of Grunt EVOs and the Stag\noffset by overall lower expenses as we seek to reduce costs.\nProduct Development Expense\nProduct development expenses relate to development of our products and process to manufacture these products.\nProduct development expenses were $7,868,985 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and were primarily related to expenses associated with employee payroll costs\nof $1,772,836, stock-based compensation of $837,271 for share-based awards granted to employees and consultants, professional fees of $298,713 for consultants assisting\nwith product design and programming, prototype vehicles and parts costs of $3,662,908, testing costs of $240,472 to complete testing of vehicles including any required\nregulatory tests, $198,224 for supplies and software and facilities costs of $192,998.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, product development expenses totaled $8,456,157 and primarily related to expenses associated with employee payroll costs of\n$3,646,927, stock-based compensation of $704,152 for share-based awards granted to employees and consultants, $1,010,895 for consulting fees for product design, other\nprofessional fees of $133,680, primarily for employee recruiting, prototype parts and tooling costs of $2,201,706, facilities cost of $262,762 and software fees, small\nequipment, tools and shop supplies of $183,761.\nWe expect 2024 product development costs related to employee costs to remain consistent with 2023. We expect costs to decrease for design and development costs\nand costs related to prototype costs for the current version of the Stag since the Stag is essentially ready for production in early 2024. We expect design and development costs\nto increase for development of other versions of our UTV lineup being considered for future release. We expect costs for design and development costs related to the Grunt\nEVO to decrease since it is in production and we expect costs related to the design and development of the Runt LT to be minimal since we already have prototypes of the\nproduct.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses relate to costs for our finance, accounting and administrative functions to support the development, manufacturing and sales of\nour products.\n30\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, general and administrative expenses were $6,388,007 and were primarily related to expenses associated with employee payroll\ncosts of $1,613,575, stock-based compensation of $885,113 for share-based awards granted to employees, professional fees of $1,024,774 (including legal fees of $522,334, tax\nand audit fees of $326,702 and recruiting fees of $50,297), software costs were $444,318, insurance costs of $1,465,092, facilities costs of $249,074, which includes $85,756 of\nlease termination costs, annual and special stockholder meeting costs of $227,439 and board compensation expense of $117,000.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses were $9,046,778 and were primarily related to expenses associated with employee payroll\ncosts of $2,497,956, stock-based compensation of $1,211,788, professional fees of $2,197,734, including legal fees of $1,714,350 and recruiting fees of $173,122, insurance\ncosts of $1,539,798, public company costs of $416,629 excluding legal fees of $496,364 included above, and software fees of $361,014.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of 2023 over the next several quarters as we have decreased\nstaffing in some administrative areas but expect costs such as insurance and public company reporting and compliance requirements to offset the employee cost reductions.\nInterest and Other Expenses, net\nInterest and other income/expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $15,278,462. A loss on extinguishment of the Convertible Notes of $22,296,988 was\nrecognized in the year ended December 31, 2023 (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). Non-cash interest expense of $4,969,590 was recognized for the\namortization of debt issuance costs and accretion of principal on the Convertible Notes issued in August 2022 prior to extinguishment of the Convertible Notes and for the May\n2023 Notes. A gain on the change in the valuation of derivative financial liabilities and warrant liabilities of $13,473,218 was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2023\n(see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). Offering costs related to the November 2023 public offering for the amount allocated to the issuance of Series A and\nSeries B Warrants in the amount of $1,444,547.\nInterest and other expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $2,171,780. Non-cash interest expense of $2,231,403 was recognized for the amortization\nof debt issuance costs and accretion of principal on the Convertible Notes issued in August 2022.\nWe expect interest expense to decrease in the future due to the exchange of the May 2023 Notes for Preferred Stock.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $45,071,211, compared to $34,235,405 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn December 31, 2023, we had cash of $8.2 million, including $0.2 million of restricted cash and we had a negative working capital of $21.4 million. Since inception\nin February 2020, we have funded our operations from proceeds from debt and equity offerings.\nCash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and includes all of our operating costs except stock-based compensation\nof $2.6 million, write-down of inventory of $4.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $0.2 million, non-cash interest expense for the amortization of debt issuance costs\nand accretion of principal on Convertible Notes and May 2023 Notes of $5.0 million, gain on change in derivative financial liabilities of $13.5 million, loss on extinguishment\nof Convertible Notes of $22.3 million, bad debt expense of $0.1 million. Cash used in operating activities includes a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.6 million due to\ncollections, increases in inventory of $7.6 million due to the purchase of Brats, Volcon Youth motorcycles and purchases of inventory for the Stag after considering the write\ndown of Grunt and Volcon Youth motorcycle inventory, a decrease of $0.2 million in accounts payable, and an increase of $1.1 million in accrued liabilities due primarily to the\naccrual recorded for the settlement to Torrot. As of December 31, 2023, we have an increase of $0.4 million in customer deposits, primarily for orders to be fulfilled from two\nof our Latin American distributors for shipments of Brats and Grunt EVOs.\n31\nNet cash used in operating activities was $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and includes all of our operating costs except non-cash expenses\nincluding stock-based compensation of $3.3 million, write-down of inventory and prepaid inventory of $1.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $0.8 million, non-cash\ninterest expense for the amortization of debt issuance costs and accretion of principal on Convertible Notes of $2.2 million, amortization of right of use assets and lease costs of\n$0.4 million and losses on write-off of assets and leases of $0.6 million. Cash used in operating activities includes increases in accounts receivable of $0.8 million for sales\nmade to dealers, an increase in inventory of $5.1 million offset by a reduction in inventory deposits of $1.6 million as we made fewer deposits based on outsourcing of the\nassembly of the Grunt in August 2022 as the third party manufacturer will purchase raw materials prospectively, a decrease of $2.3 million of customer deposits as we fulfilled\nall direct to consumer orders, a decrease of $0.4 million due to timing of payments on accounts payable, a decrease of $0.2 million in accrued liabilities and an increase in\nprepaid expenses and other assets of $0.8 million.\nCash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, consisting of $0.9 million of purchases of equipment and tooling offset\nby proceeds of $0.1 million received for the sale of two vehicles.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $0.3 million of purchases of equipment and\ntooling related to our Brat, Grunt, and Runt manufacturing and product development, $0.2 million for the cost of Grunts capitalized as demonstration units, and $0.2 million\nrelated to computers and equipment due to headcount growth prior to headcount reductions that occurred in the third quarter of 2022.\nCash provided by financing activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $27.1 million and was related primarily to proceeds from the public offerings of\n32,889 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of $4.6 million, issuance of convertible notes in a private offering with a principal amount of $4.9 million and net proceeds\nof $3.9 million, and proceeds from the public offering of 73,913 common stock units and 878,469 pre-funded warrants units for net proceeds of $16.2 million. We also received\nproceeds of $1.0 million from the exercise of 9,156 warrants and reduction of the exercise price for 7,778 warrants.\nCash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $40.4 million and was related to proceeds received from both the public offering\nof our common stock in February 2022 where we sold 29,630 shares at $675.00 per share for net cash proceeds of $18.1 million and the issuance of senior Convertible Notes\nand Note Warrants in August 2022 for net cash proceeds of $22.3 million.\nOur continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to attain profitable operations and if necessary, obtain continued financial support from the issuance\nof debt or equity. As of December 31, 2023, we had incurred an accumulated deficit of $120.8 million since inception.\nManagement anticipates that our cash on hand as of December 31, 2023 plus the cash expected to be generated from operations will not be sufficient to fund planned\noperations during the near term and not beyond one year from the date of the issuance of the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. As such, to\ncontinue our operations in the near term we will be required to raise additional financing in the third quarter of 2024. We do not have commitments for any such financing, and\nthere can be no assurance that such additional funding would be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional near-term\nfinancing, we will be required to modify or curtail our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nThe recently enacted JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of\nthe Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of\ncertain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition\nperiod and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\n32\nWe have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and may impact our financial statements and we do not believe that there are any other\nnew accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical\naccounting policies:\nDerivative Financial Liabilities and Warrant Liabilities\nWe do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including\nconversion features of our convertible debt and warrants issued in connection with our convertible debt, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that\nqualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The classification of derivative financial instruments,\nincluding whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed at the end of each reporting period.\nWe accounted for the conversion features of our New Notes and Exchange Notes and related Note Warrants and Exchange Warrants issued in connection with the New\nNotes and Exchange Notes, all issued May 2023, as derivative financial liabilities in accordance with ASC 815. Accordingly, we recognized these derivative financial liabilities\nat fair value initially and adjusted them to fair value at each reporting period. These liabilities were subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised or until\nthe conversion feature share price and the warrant exercise price become fixed, and any change in fair value was recognized in the statement of operations. The fair value of\nthese financial instruments were initially measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and subsequently, the fair value was also estimated using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation model until they were no longer deemed derivative liabilities as of August 3, 2023. In addition, we made a probability assessment as to whether our stockholders\nwould approve the adjustment of the conversion prices and exercise prices of the derivative financial liabilities.\nWe account for the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants issued in connection with the November 2023 Common Units and Prefunded Warrant Units as financial\nliabilities in accordance with ASC 815. Accordingly, we recognize these financial liabilities at fair value initially and adjust them to fair value at each reporting period. The\nliabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised or until warrant exercise price and number of warrants become fixed, and any change in fair\nvalue is recognized in the statement of operations. The fair value of these financial instruments were initially measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and\nsubsequently, the fair value was also estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of December 31, 2023. In addition, we made a probability assessment as to whether\nour stockholders would approve the adjustment of the exercise prices of the financial liabilities. The determination of the fair value of the warrant liability may be subject to\nchange as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of MaloneBailey, LLP, Houston, TX (PCAOB ID 206)\nFinancial Statements\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity (Deficit) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n34\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nVolcon, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Volcon, Inc. and its subsidiary (collectively, the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nand the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Matter\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the\nCompany has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net working capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this\nuncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP\nwww.malonebailey.com\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2021.\nHouston, Texas\nMarch 28,

(“Volcon” or the “Company”) was formed on February 21, 2020, as a Delaware corporation, under the name Frog ePowersports, Inc. The Company was renamed\nVolcon, Inc. on October 1, 2020. Volcon designs and sells all-electric off-road powersport vehicles.\nOn January 5, 2021, the Company created Volcon ePowersports, LLC (“Volcon LLC”), a Colorado wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to sell Volcon vehicles and\naccessories in the U.S. Volcon LLC is no longer used for selling vehicles and accessories.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has recurring losses and\nhas generated negative cash flows from operations since inception.\nIn August 2022, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $22.3 million for the issuance of convertible notes due February 2024 (“Convertible Notes”) and\nwarrants (see Note 6).\nThe Company received net proceeds of approximately $3.9 million for the issuance of additional convertible notes in May 2023 due February 2024 (“New Notes”) and\nwarrants. On the issuance date of the New Notes, the Company exchanged the Convertible Notes for Series A and Series B notes (collectively the “Exchange Notes”). The\nExchange Notes require the Company to have unrestricted and unencumbered cash on deposit of $10 million if the outstanding principal (and interest, if any) of the Exchange\nNotes is $15,000,000 or greater as of December 31, 2023 (the September 30, 2023 requirement under the Convertible Notes was removed). The cash on deposit requirement is\nreduced dollar for dollar to the extent the outstanding principal (and interest, if any) of the Exchange Notes is less than $15 million on this date. The Company also exchanged\nthe warrants issued with the Convertible Notes for new warrants (the “Exchange Warrants”) (see Note 6 for further discussion).\nIn May 2023, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $4.0 million for the issuance of 26,667 shares of common stock at $168.75 per share.\nOn September 14, 2023, the holders of the New Notes and Exchange Notes (collectively the “May 2023 Notes”) entered into an agreement to modify the terms to extend the\ndue date to January 31, 2025. In addition, the requirement to have unrestricted and unencumbered cash on deposit of $10 million if the outstanding principal (and interest, if\nany) of the Exchange Notes is $15 million or greater as of December 31, 2023 was amended to reduce the unrestricted and unencumbered cash on deposit to $5 million if the\noutstanding principal (and interest, if an) of the Exchange Notes is $15 million or greater as of June 30, 2024. The cash on deposit requirement is reduced dollar for dollar to the\nextent the outstanding principal (and interest, if any) of the Exchange Notes is less than $15 million on this date. The Company may factor up to $10 million of its accounts\nreceivables provided the factoring lender executed a subordination and intercreditor agreement on terms acceptable to the holders of the May 2023 Notes, which was completed\non October 17, 2023. The Company was also required to perfect a security interest in the assets of the Company no later than September 22, 2023, which the Company has\ncompleted.\nOn September 18, 2023, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $571,400 for the issuance of 6,222 shares of common stock at $112.50 per share.\nIn a series of warrant inducement transactions from September 29, 2023 to October 30, 2023, as more fully discussed below, the Company raised $1,027,478.\n42\nOn November 17, 2023, received net proceeds of approximately $16.2 million for the issuance of 73,913 Common Units and 878,469 Pre-Funded Units. Each Common Unit\nconsists of one share of common stock, a Series A Warrant to purchase one share of common stock and a Series B Warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Each Pre-\nFunded Unit consists of one Pre-Funded Warrant to purchase one share of our common stock, a Series A Warrant and a Series B Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants are\nimmediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. Subject to stockholder approval, the Series A and Series B\nWarrants are subject to adjustments. See further discussion in Note 9.\nIn February and March 2024, certain holders of the May 2023 Convertible Notes issued in May 2023 converted approximately $7.4 million of principal to common stock. In\nMarch 2024, the holders exchanged the remaining May 2023 Convertible Notes of $24.7 million for Series A convertible preferred stock with a $1,000 per share value and an\ninitial conversation price of $1.33 per share for common stock. All covenants from the Convertible Notes were terminated upon this exchange. In March 2024, certain holders\nof the Series A convertible preferred stock converted $2.3 million shares to 1.7 million shares of common stock.\nManagement anticipates that our cash on hand as of December 31, 2023 plus cash expected to be generated from operations will not be sufficient to fund planned operations\nbeyond one year from the date of the issuance of the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. There can be no assurance that additional funding, if\nneeded, would be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNasdaq Compliance\nOn July 5, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(b)(2), which requires that it maintain a market\nvalue of listed securities (“MVLS”) of $35 million. MVLS is calculated by multiplying the Company’s shares outstanding by the closing price of its common stock. On July 6,\n2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of its common stock had\nbeen below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. On October 13, 2023, the Company completed a 1 for 5 reverse stock split and the Company’s common stock\nprice increased to over $1.00. On October 30, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq that it had regained compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid\nprice of its common stock was above $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days. On December 19, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq that it was again not in\ncompliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of its common stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days.\nOn December 26, 2023, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that it is not in compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) as the closing bid price of our common\nstock had been below $0.10 for ten consecutive trading days from December 11, 2023 through December 22, 2023 and was subject to delisting on January 2, 2024. On January\n4, 2024, the Company received notice from Nasdaq that we did not meet the MVLS requirement and we were subject to delisting. The Company submitted a hearing request to\nNasdaq’s Hearings Department for both of these matters, which stayed the suspension of the Company’s common stock. The Company participated in a hearing with Nasdaq;s\nHearings Department on March 26, 2024 and they informed the Company that it could receive a decision within two weeks from the hearing date, although the timing of the\ndecision is at the discretion of Nasdaq.\nImpact of Russia and Ukraine Conflict\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine could impact the availability of nickel, an element used in the production of lithium-\nion cells used in batteries that power our vehicles. The shortage of these cells could have an impact on our ability to produce vehicles to meet our customers’ demands. In\naddition, sanctions against Russia could impact the price of elements, including nickel, which are used in the production of batteries which would result in higher costs to\nproduce our vehicles. These sanctions have also impacted the U.S. and global economies and could result in an economic recession which could cause a broader disruption to\nthe Company’s supply chain and distribution network and customer demand for our products.\n43\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows:\nBasis of Presentation\nThe basis of accounting applied is the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the\naccounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nAs discussed in Notes 9 and 14, the Company completed a reverse 1 for 5 stock split on October 13, 2023 and a reverse 1 for 45 stock split on February 2, 2024, all share and\nper share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the impact of these reverse stock splits.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities and disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting\nperiods.\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that\nexisted at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming\nevents. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. The recorded value of our cash and cash\nequivalents approximates their fair value. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 or 2022. Restricted cash includes cash restricted as collateral for the\nCompany’s corporate credit cards and a letter of credit with the Company’s bank.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor sales to dealers or distributors revenue is recognized when transfer of control of the product is made as there is no acceptance period or right of return. Revenue is measured\nas the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring control of vehicles, parts, and accessories. Beginning in February 2023 the\nCompany began selling the Brat E-Bike and Volcon Youth motorcycles directly to consumers in addition to dealers. Revenue for direct to consumer sales is recognized when\ntransfer of control of the product is made to the consumer.\nConsideration that is received in advance of the transfer of goods is recorded as customer deposits until delivery has occurred or the customer cancels their order, and the\nconsideration is returned to the customer. Sales and other taxes the Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The Company’s\nsales do not presently have a financing component.\nSales promotions and incentives. The Company provides for estimated sales promotions and incentives, which are recognized as a component of sales in measuring the amount\nof consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include rebates,\ndistributor fees, dealer co-op advertising and volume incentives. Sales promotions and incentives are estimated based on contractual requirements. The Company records these\namounts as a liability in the balance sheet until they are ultimately paid. Adjustments to sales promotions and incentives accruals are made as actual usage becomes known to\nproperly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date.\n44\nShipping and handling charges and costs. The Company records shipping and handling amounts charged to the customer and related shipping costs as a component of cost of\ngoods sold when control has transferred to the customer.\nProduct Warranties\nThe Company provides a one-year warranty on vehicles, and a two-year warranty on the battery pack. The Company accrues warranty reserves at the time revenue is\nrecognized. Warranty reserves include the Company’s best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace any items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience\nas it becomes available and other known factors that may impact the evaluation of historical data. The Company reviews its reserves quarterly to ensure that the accruals are\nadequate to meet expected future warranty obligations and will adjust estimates as needed. Factors that could have an impact on the warranty reserve include the following:\nchanges in manufacturing quality, shifts in product mix, changes in warranty coverage periods, product recalls and changes in sales volume. Warranty expense is recorded as a\ncomponent of cost of goods sold in the statement of operations and is recognized as a current liability.\nInventory and Inventory Deposits\nInventories and prepaid inventory deposits are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value.\nCertain vendors require the Company to pay an upfront deposit before they manufacture and ship the Company’s parts or accessories. These payments are classified as prepaid\ninventory deposits on the balance sheet until title and risk of loss transfers to the Company, at which time they are classified as inventory.\nRaw materials inventory costs include the cost of parts, including duties, tariffs, and shipping. Work-in-process and finished goods include the cost of parts, labor and\nmanufacturing overhead costs associated with the assembly of the vehicle. Finished goods also include accessories for the vehicle and branded merchandise such as hats and\nshirts.\nThrough August 2022 the Company assembled the Grunt motorcycle in a leased facility. The Company ceased assembly operations at the end of August and outsourced the\nassembly of the Grunt to a third party.\nIn May 2023, the Company transferred substantially all of its raw materials and work-in-process inventory for the Grunt to the third party manufacturer in the second quarter of\n2023. Title to the inventory transferred to the third party manufacturer and the manufacturer provides the Company with a credit towards future purchases of the Grunt EVO.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are valued at cost. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of\nequipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nEstimated\nCategory Useful Lives\nMachinery, tooling and equipment 3-7 years\nVehicles 5 years\nInternal use manufactured vehicles 1 year\nFurniture & Fixtures 5 years\nComputers 3 years\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter period of their estimated useful life or term of the lease.\n45\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical carrying cost value of an asset may no\nlonger be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the asset by comparing the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the asset to the carrying\nvalue. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the\ndifference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived asset.\nLeases\nRight-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over\nthe lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expenses for these leases on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term. The Company does not separate non-lease components from the lease components to which they relate, and instead accounts for each separate lease\nand non-lease component associated with that lease component as a single lease component.\nASC 842 defines initial direct costs as only the incremental costs of signing a lease. Initial direct costs related to leasing that are not incremental are expensed as general and\nadministrative expenses in our statements of operations.\nThe Company’s operating lease agreements primarily consist of leased real estate and are included within ROU assets – operating leases and ROU lease liabilities – operating\nleases on the balance sheets. The Company’s lease agreements may include options to extend the lease, which are not included in minimum lease payments unless they are\nreasonably certain to be exercised at lease commencement. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate\nbased on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe Company records research and development expenses in the period in which they are incurred as a component of product development expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred taxes are determined utilizing the “asset and liability” method, whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on the differences\nbetween financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance, when it’s more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Deferred\ntax liabilities and assets are classified as current or non-current based on the underlying asset or liability or if not directly related to an asset or liability based on the expected\nreversal dates of the specific temporary differences.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC Topic 820”) provides a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\n46\nASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained\nfrom independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in\nthe circumstances (unobservable inputs).\nThe fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)\nand the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are described as follows:\n· Level 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.\n· Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include\nquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than\nquoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or\nother means.\n· Level 3 — Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.\nThe following section describes the valuation methodologies that the Company used to measure different financial instruments at fair value.\nDebt\nThe fair value of the Company’s debt approximated the carrying value of the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Factors that the Company considered when\nestimating the fair value of its debt included market conditions, and term of the debt. The level of the debt would be considered as Level 2.\nThe Company relies on the guidance provided by ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, to classify certain convertible instruments. The Company first\ndetermines whether a financial instrument should be classified as a liability. The Company will determine the liability classification if the financial instrument is mandatorily\nredeemable, or if the financial instrument, other than outstanding shares, embodies a conditional obligation that the Company must or may settle by issuing a variable number\nof its equity shares.\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC Topic 815”), and all derivative instruments are reflected\nas either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company uses estimates of fair value to value its derivative instruments. Fair value is defined\nas the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between able and willing market participants. In general, the Company’s policy in estimating fair\nvalues is to first look at observable market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available, other inputs are used to\nmodel fair value such as prices of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, default rates and credit spreads, relying first on observable data from active\nmarkets. Depending on the availability of observable inputs and prices, different valuation models could produce materially different fair value estimates. The values presented\nmay not represent future fair values and may not be realizable. The Company categorizes its fair value estimates in accordance with ASC Topic 820, based on the hierarchical\nframework associated with the three levels or price transparency utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value as discussed above.\nOnce the Company determines that a financial instrument should not be classified as a liability, the Company determines whether the financial instrument should be presented\nbetween the liability section and the equity section of the balance sheet (“temporary equity”). The Company will determine temporary equity classification if the redemption of\nthe financial instrument is outside the control of the Company (i.e., at the option of the holder). Otherwise, the Company accounts for the financial instrument as permanent\nequity.\n47\nInitial Measurement\nThe Company records its financial instruments classified as a liability, temporary equity or permanent equity at issuance at the fair value, or cash received.\nSubsequent Measurement - Financial instruments classified as liabilities\nThe Company records the fair value of its financial instruments classified as liabilities at each subsequent measurement date. The changes in fair value of its financial\ninstruments classified as liabilities are recorded as other expense/income. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the fair value of derivatives for instruments with\nembedded conversion features and for free standing warrants as discussed further in Note 7.\nAdditional Disclosures Regarding Fair Value Measurements\nThe carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, other assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity\nof those items.\nWarrant Liabilities and Convertible Liabilities\nThe fair value of the derivative liabilities and warrant liabilities is classified as Level 3 within the Company’s fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 7, Derivative Instruments, for\nfurther discussion of the measurement of fair value of the derivatives and their underlying assumptions.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company has a stock-based incentive award plan for employees, consultants and directors. The Company measures stock-based compensation at the estimated fair value\non the grant date and recognizes the amortization of stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, or when it is probable criteria\nwill be achieved for performance-based awards. Fair value is determined based on assumptions related to the fair value of the Company common stock, stock volatility and\nrisk-free rate of return. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures when realized.\nConcentration Risk\nThe Company outsources certain portions of product design and development for its vehicles to third parties. In addition, the Company has outsourced the manufacturing of all\nof its vehicles to third party manufacturers, including one manufacturer for two of its vehicles, the Stag and Grunt EVO, and this third party is also performing product design\nand development services on the Stag.\nOne supplier provides the battery and drivetrain components for the Company’s utility terrain vehicle, the Stag. The components are critical to the operation of the Stag. The\nCompany also sources some of the other components from third party suppliers and the third party manufacturer sources other components from third party suppliers or\nfabricates them from materials sourced from third parties.\nOn January 8, 2024, the Company notified the manufacturer of the Volcon Youth motorcycles that it was terminating the co-branding and distribution agreement with them due\nto lower than anticipated sales of these units. In March 2024, the Company agreed to allow the manufacturer to keep all fully paid for units manufactured and held by the\nmanufacturer and pay cash of $2,070,000 which includes a payment of $370,000 in March 2024 and $100,000 monthly for seventeen months starting April 2024. The Company\nhas recorded this amount in the 2023 financial statements. As discussed below, the Company has written down this inventory to its estimated net realizable value and accrued\nthe cash settlement offer.\n48\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects\nexpected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2023. The\nCompany determined that the update applied to trade receivables, but that there was no material impact to the consolidated financial statements from the adoption of ASU\n2016-13.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standard Board or other standard setting bodies that the Company adopts as of the\nspecified effective date. The Company does not believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will have a material impact on the Company’s\nfinancial position or results of operations upon adoption.\nNOTE 3 – INVENTORY\nInventory consists of the following:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nRaw materials $ 6,770,892 $ 3,060,160\nWork-in-process – 439,839\nFinished goods 2,202,242 2,145,884\nTotal inventory $ 8,973,134 $ 5,645,883\nIn June 2023, the Company wrote down all remaining Torrot branded inventory in the amount of $84,000. During 2023, the Company wrote down the Volcon co-branded\nTorrot youth motorcycles in the amount of $2,674,352 to reduce their cost to the estimated net realizable value. The Company also wrote down all remaining Grunt inventory of\n$1,564,643 upon transfer of the inventory to the Company’s third party manufacturer. The Company has purchase commitments for future payments due for inventory of\n$1,894,842.\nNOTE 4 – LONG – LIVED ASSETS\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consist of the following:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nMachinery, tooling and equipment $ 1,015,568 $ 352,137\nVehicles 213,528 156,648\nInternal use manufactured vehicles 22,906 274,385\nFixtures & furniture 90,768 50,768\nLeasehold improvements 44,663 44,663\nComputers 221,571 228,671\n1,609,004 1,107,272\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (350,397) (505,506)\nTotal property and equipment $ 1,258,607 $ 601,766\nDepreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $243,394 and $757,013, respectively.\n49\nNOTE 5 – NOTES PAYABLE\nIn December 2020, the Company entered into a financing arrangement for $75,702 with an interest rate of 8.64% for a vehicle. The Company was required to make monthly\npayments of $1,211 over 72 months. In April 2021, the Company entered into a financing arrangement for $30,942 with an interest rate of 7.64% for a vehicle. The Company\nwas required to make monthly payments of $753 over 48 months. The Company sold both vehicles in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and paid off these notes.\nIn March 2023, the Company entered into two financing arrangements to purchase two vehicles. The total principal of these arrangements is $96,024 with interest rates of\n11.44% and 8.63% and monthly payments totaling $1,923 are due through February 2028 and $908 per month until February 2029. The vehicles are collateral for these\narrangements.\nThe following table provides the maturities of notes payable as of December 31, 2023:\n2024 $ 23,073\n2025 23,073\n2026 23,073\n2027 23,073\n2028 12,927\n2029 1,816\nTotal future payments 107,035\nLess: Interest (22,619)\nTotal notes payable 84,416\nLess current portion (15,278)\nLong-term notes payable $ 69,138\nNOTE 6 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES\nOn August 24, 2022, the Company issued senior convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of $27,173,913 due February 24, 2024. The Convertible Notes had an\ninitial conversion price of $506.25 per share of common stock (53,677 total shares if fully converted) and were issued with an original issue discount of 8.0% and did not bear\ninterest unless an event of default occurred, upon which interest would have accrued at 10% per annum. The holders of the Convertible Notes could have converted any portion\nof the principal at any time during the term of the notes. The holders of the Convertible Notes also received fully vested warrants (the “Note Warrants”) to purchase 40,260\nshares of the Company’s common stock at an initial exercise price of $641.25 per share. The conversion and warrant exercise prices were subject to adjustment if the Company\ndeclared a stock dividend, stock split or recapitalization. The Company received net cash proceeds, after issuance costs (excluding the value of the warrants issued to the\nplacement agent as discussed below) of $22,300,321.\nCompany allocated the net proceeds received from the issuance of the Convertible Notes and Note Warrants based on the relative fair values of each resulting in net proceeds of\n$15,122,345 being allocated to the Convertible Notes recorded as a current liability in the balance sheet and net proceeds of $6,561,247 being allocated to the Note Warrants\nwhich was recorded in equity. The Company recorded non-cash interest expense through May 24, 2023 (see below for discussion of issuance of additional convertible notes) to\naccrete the allocated value of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method and an interest rate of 39.6%. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $3,316,409\nupon issuance of the Convertible Notes, which includes $616,730 for the fair value of the warrants issued to the placement agent of the Convertible Notes as further described\nin Note 9. These debt issuance costs were amortized as additional interest expense through May 24, 2023. Interest expense recorded for the Convertible Notes for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $2,913,632 and $2,231,403, respectively.\n50\nOn May 24, 2023, the Company issued additional senior convertible notes (“New Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $4,934,783 due February 24, 2024 to the same\ninvestors of the Convertible Notes. The New Notes had an initial conversion price of $571.50 per share of common stock, which was subject to adjustment to $168.75 upon\nstockholder approval (29,244 total shares if fully converted at $168.75 per share, stockholder approval was received on August 3, 2023). The conversion price is also subject to\nfurther adjustment if the Company completes an equity or convertible note offering with a price below $168.75, or completes a stock split, reverse stock split or recapitalization\nwhere the lowest day’s volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Company’s stock price is below $168.75 in the five days following the stock split, with a floor price of\n$0.22 (subject to stockholder approval, which was obtained on August 3, 2023). The conversion price is also subject to further adjustment if the Company completes an equity\nor convertible note offering with a price below $168.75. The New Notes were issued with an original issue discount of 8.8% and do not bear interest unless an event of default\nhas occurred, upon which interest accrues at 10% per annum.\nThe holders of the New Notes also received fully vested warrants (the “New Warrants”) to purchase 24,155 shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial exercise price\nof $245.25 per share.\nConcurrent with the issuance of the New Notes, the Company exchanged the Convertible Notes into two new notes, Series A Notes and Series B Notes both due February 24,\n2024 (collectively the “Exchange Notes” and collectively with the New Notes the “May 2023 Notes”). The aggregate principal amount of Series A Notes is $3,690,422 and\nthese are convertible into the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion price of $168.75 per share (21,870 total shares if fully converted). The aggregate principal\namount of the Series B Notes is $23,483,491 and were initially convertible into the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion price of $245.25 per share (95,754 total\nshares if fully converted) but were subject to adjustment to $168.75 upon stockholder approval (139,162 total shares if fully converted at $168.75 per share), which approval\nwas received on August 3, 2023.\nThe Company also exchanged the 40,258 Note Warrants with an exercise price of $641.25 per share issued with the Convertible Notes in August 2022 for 75,814 warrants\nwhich had an initial exercise price of $245.25 per share (the “Exchange Warrants”), and which exercise price was adjusted to $168.75 per share upon stockholder approval,\nwhich approval was received on August 3, 2023. The Exchange Warrants expire August 24, 2027.\nIn September 2023, the Company completed a public offering and sold 6,223 shares of common stock at $112.50 per share. The holders of the May 2023 Notes waived their\nright to reduce the conversion price to the equity issuance price and agreed to reduce the conversion price to $123.75 per share. The exercise price of the May 2023 Warrants\nwere reduced to $112.50 per share as a result of the public offering.\nIn September 2023, the holders of the May 2023 Notes agreed to modify the due date of these notes to January 31, 2025. See discussion of further modifications below. The\nCompany also executed a security interest to the holders for substantially all of the assets of the Company.\nThe May 2023 Notes contain certain conversion limitations, providing that no conversion may be made if, after giving effect to the conversion, the holder, together with any of\nits affiliates, would own in excess of 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock after giving effect to such conversion. The Company can force conversion\nof the Series A and Series B Notes at any time if the weighted average price of the Company’s common stock for ten consecutive trading days equals or exceeds $263.25 or\n$380.25, respectively, subject to the share limitations described above. In addition to default interest of 10% accruing on the May 2023 Notes, the holders may require the\nCompany to redeem a portion or all of the outstanding May 2023 Notes.\n51\nEvents of default for the May 2023 Notes are defined in the note agreements and include the following:\n· Failure of the Company to file a registration statement, and have declared effective to register the shares of the Company’s common stock within a specified period\n(the Company has met this requirement as of September 28, 2023)\n· Suspension of trading, or failure to be listed, of the Company’s common stock on an eligible market, as defined, for a period of two consecutive trading days or an\naggregate of ten trading days in a 365 day period\n· Failure to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock within five days following a conversion notification\n· Failure to reserve shares of the Company’s common stock for the conversion of the May 2023 Notes and May 2023 Warrants\n· Any acceleration prior to maturity of any indebtedness of the Company, declaration of bankruptcy, or court ordered bankruptcy\n· Final judgment or judgments for payment aggregating in excess of $250,000 are rendered against the Company not covered by insurance or indemnity and are not\ndischarged or stayed pending appeal within 60 days of judgment\n· Breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by the Company to the transaction documents of the May 2023 Notes and Exchange Warrants\n· Any material damage to, or loss, theft or destruction of a material amount of the property of the Company\n· Failure to remove any restrictive legends on any shares of the Company’s common stock issued to the holders of the May 2023 Notes\n· Electronic transfer of shares of the Company’s common stock is not available\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the above covenants.\nThe May 2023 Notes originally required the Company to have unrestricted and unencumbered cash on deposit of $10 million if the outstanding principal (and interest, if any)\nof the May 2023 Notes is $15 million or greater as of December 31, 2023. The cash on deposit requirement is reduced dollar for dollar to the extent that the outstanding\nprincipal (and interest, if any) of the May 2023 Notes is less than $15 million on December 31, 2023. In September 2023, the note holders modified this requirement to change\nthe date from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024 and reduced the cash on deposit requirement to $5 million. All other provisions for this cash on deposit requirement remain\nunchanged.\nAs discussed in Note 9, the Company completed a 1 for 5 reverse stock split on October 13, 2023 and the lowest day’s VWAP in the five days following the reverse split was\n$61.605 per share and the conversion price of New Notes and Exchange Notes, and the exercise price of the New Warrants and Exchange Warrants were reduced to $61.605 per\nshare effective October 20, 2023.\nThe conversion prices of the Exchange Notes, and the exercise prices of the New Warrants and Exchange Warrants (collectively the “May 2023 Warrants”) are subject to further\nadjustment in the event that the Company issues additional common stock, stock options, warrants or convertible notes with prices below the exercise price in effect at the time\nof issuance, or completes a stock split, reverse stock split or recapitalization where the lowest day’s VWAP of the Company’s stock price is below $61.605 in the five days\nfollowing the stock split with a floor of $0.22 per share. See Note 14 for discussion of the impact of the 1 for 45 reverse split on February 2, 2024. Also in September 2023, the\nCompany and the holders of the Exchange Warrants entered into a warrant inducement agreement whereby the Exchange Warrant holders agreed to exercise 6,824 Exchange\nWarrants at a reduced exercise price of $78.75 per share. The Company issued the holders 6,824 warrants (“Reload Warrants”) with an exercise price of $112.50 per share. The\nReload Warrants are immediately exercisable for unregistered shares of the Company’s common stock and have the same terms as the May 2023 Warrants and expire August\n24, 2027. The Company recognized equity issuance costs of $216,855 for the issuance of the Reload Warrants.\nHolders of the May 2023 Notes, the May 2023 Warrants and Reload Warrants (collectively the “Holders”) do not have voting rights to the extent they have not converted their\nnotes or exercised their warrants.\nThe May 2023 Warrants and Reload Warrants contain certain conversion limitations, providing that a holder thereof may not exercise such warrants to the extent that, if after\ngiving effect to such conversion, the holder or any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock\nimmediately after giving effect to such exercise. The May 2023 Warrants and Reload Warrants provide the holders the right to exercise these warrants on a non-cash basis if the\nCompany does not have an effective registration statement for the underlying shares of common stock.\n52\nThe Company has evaluated the issuance of the New Notes and Exchange Notes and related warrants and determined that the Convertible Notes were extinguished based on the\nconclusion that the terms of the New Notes and Exchange Notes are substantially different from the Convertible Notes in accordance with ASC 470, Debt. In addition, the\nCompany recognized a loss on the extinguishment of the Convertible Notes based on the carrying value of the Convertible Notes at the transaction date, plus gross proceeds\nreceived from the issuance of New Notes and New Warrants, less the fair value of the i) New Notes and conversion option, ii) New Warrants, iii) Exchange Notes and\nconversion options, and iv) Exchange Warrants. The resulting loss on extinguishment was $22,296,988, which included the unamortized issuance costs of $1,330,296 of the\nConvertible Notes as of the date of the issuance of the New Notes. The fair value of the May 2023 Notes was estimated based on the future cash flows discounted at an interest\nrate of 14.9%. The May 2023 Notes were recorded at their initial fair values as follows:\nFair Value Principal Amount\nNew Notes $ 4,410,058 $ 4,934,783\nSeries A Exchange Notes 3,298,012 3,690,422\nSeries B Exchange Notes 20,986,449 23,483,891\nTotal May 2023 Notes $ 28,694,519 $ 32,109,096\nThe Company recognized interest expense of $1,739,123 in the year ended December 31, 2023 for the accretion of the discount on the May 2023 Notes during the periods.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the conversion features of the New Notes, Exchange Notes, New Warrants and Exchange Warrants as of May 24, 2023 as discussed in\nNote 7 below.\nThe Company incurred debt issuance costs of $586,968 upon issuance of the New Notes and New Warrants. The Company is amortizing these issuance costs as additional\ninterest expense over the remaining term of the New Notes. The Company recognized interest expense of $302,955 for the amortization of these issuance costs for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were no conversions of the May 2023 Notes. As discussed in Note 14, on March 4, 2024, the Company exchanged the May 2023 Notes for\nSeries A preferred stock. As a result, there are no remaining covenants related to the May 2023 Notes that the Company must comply with and the security interest on the assets\nof the Company has been released by the noteholders.\nNOTE 7 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND WARRANT LIABILITIES\nMay 2023 Notes and May 2023 Warrants\nAs discussed in Note 6, the Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of the Convertible Notes based on the fair values of the May 2023 Notes including the\nconversion feature, and the May 2023 Warrants. The Company determined that there was a derivative liability associated with the conversion features in the May 2023 Notes\ndue to the conversion price being subject to stockholder approval in the conversion feature. Therefore, the Company has separated conversion features from the May 2023\nNotes and has recorded them at fair value and will continue to adjust them to fair value until shareholder approval is received as the conversion price is then only adjusted based\non anti-dilutive provisions. The Company has also determined that the May 2023 Warrants are derivative liabilities due to the potential adjustment in the exercise prices being\nsubject to stockholder approval. Once shareholder approval is received, the exercise price of the warrants only adjusts based on anti-dilutive provisions.\n53\nThe fair value of the conversion features and warrant liabilities were calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions and methodologies:\nMay 24, 2023 August 3, 2023\nConversion Feature Liabilities\nCompany stock price on valuation date $ 157.50 $ 123.975\nVolatility (closing prices of guideline comparable public companies) 86.3% 84.1%\nConversion price per share $ 168.75 $ 168.75\nNote term (years) 0.76 0.56\nRisk free interest rate 5.1% 5.4%\nWarrant Liabilities\nCompany stock price on valuation date $ 157.50 $ 123.975\nVolatility (closing prices of guideline comparable public companies) 119.2% 115.0%\nConversion price per share $ 168.75 $ 168.75\nWarrant term (years) 4.25 4.06\nRisk free interest rate 3.8% 4.3%\nIn addition to the above factors, the Company also used a probability assessment for the initial and August 3, 2023 valuation to evaluate whether stockholder approval would be\nreceived to lower the conversion and exercise prices. The Company utilized a 50/50 assessment that stockholders would or would not approve the lower conversion and\nexercise price. Management notes that at the time of the assessment, the stockholder vote had not yet started therefore there was no data to determine whether one scenario was\nmore likely than another. Since the stockholders approved the lower conversion and exercise price on August 3, 2023, no probability assessment was used.\nBased on the above factors, the estimated fair value of the Company’s financial derivative liabilities carried at fair value at May 24, 2023 and August 2, 2023 is as follows:\nMay 24, 2023 August 3, 2023\nConversion Feature - New Notes $ 663,096 $ 557,168\nConversion Feature - Series A Exchange Notes 970,805 416,672\nConversion Feature - Series B Exchange Notes 4,324,792 2,651,436\nNew Warrants 3,123,682 2,445,244\nExchange Warrants 9,287,474 7,191,535\nTotal $ 18,369,849 $ 13,262,055\nOn August 3, 2023, stockholders approved the adjustment of the conversion price of the New Notes and Exchange Notes and the exercise price of the New Warrants and\nExchange Warrants. The conversion and exercise prices can adjust to a floor of $0.22 per share based on certain events defined in the agreements related to these instruments.\nThe Company has concluded that as of August 3, 2023, the conversion feature of the May 2023 Notes and the May 2023 Warrants are no longer derivative liabilities and\nreclassified them to equity. The Company recognized a gain of $5,107,794 for the change in the fair values of the conversion features of the May 2023 Notes for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n54\nSeries A and Series B Warrants\nAs discussed in Note 9 below, the Company issued Series A and Series B Warrants (the “November 2023 Warrants”) in connection with the sale of common units and pre-\nfunded warrant units. Under the terms of the November 2023 Warrants, the number and exercise price are subject to adjustment if the Company completes certain transactions\nspecified in these warrant agreements. Such adjustments are subject to shareholder approval, and some will result in a change in the exercise price and number of warrants, and\nothers will only result in the change in exercise price due to standard anti-dilution provisions.\nThe Company has determined that these warrants should be classified as liabilities and has used a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair values until shareholder approval\nis received and the number of warrants becomes fixed. The following assumptions were used in the valuations:\nNovember 17, 2023 December 31, 2023\nCompany stock price on valuation date $ 9.864 $ 4.46\nVolatility 138.2% 141.4%\nRisk free interest rate 4.33% 3.78%\nDividend yield 0.00% 0.00%\nWarrant term (years) 5.0 4.9\nTime to future transaction (years) 0.75 0.63\nFuture transaction probability 75% 75%\nIn addition to the above factors, the Company also used a probability assessment for the initial and December 31, 2023 valuation to evaluate whether stockholder approval\nwould be received on January 12, 2024 to lower the conversion and exercise prices. Management notes that at the time of the assessment, the stockholder vote had not yet\nstarted but there was a requirement in the offering that the board of directors, management, and a significant shareholder vote in favor of these adjustments which included\napproximately 20.1% of the shares outstanding as of the transaction date. Further, significant investors in the transaction held shares acquired prior to the record date for\neligible shareholders to vote. Although these same investors could not vote the shares received in the November 17, 2023 offering, they could abstain from voting those shares\nfor the shareholder vote and such shares would count towards whether a quorum of shares was received to hold the special meeting for the shareholder approval. Finally,\nmanagement notes that approval was overwhelmingly positive to adjust the conversion price for the May 2023 Notes and May 2023 Warrants and exercise prices. The\nCompany concluded that it was 100% likely that stockholders would approve the provisions to adjust the number of warrants and exercise price.\nBased on the above factors, the estimated fair value of the Series A and Series B Warrant liabilities at November 17, 2023 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nNovember 17, 2023 December 31, 2023\nSeries A Warrant $ 0.6576 $ 0.2970\nSeries B Warrant $ 0.1996 $ 0.0799\nThe estimated fair values as of November 17, 2023 were used to allocate the gross proceeds from the issuance of the common units and pre-funded warrant units resulting in a\nvalue of $10,990,530 and $3,345,961 being allocated to the Series A and Series B warrants, respectively. An allocation of the issuance costs from the offering was made based\non the relative fair values of the common stock, pre-funded warrants, Series A and Series B warrants and issuance costs of $1,451,249 that were allocated to the Series A and\nSeries B Warrants were expensed.\nBased on the above factors, the estimated fair value of the Company’s warrant liabilities carried at fair value at November 17, 2023 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nNovember 17, 2023 December 31, 2023\nSeries A Warrants $ 10,990,530 $ 4,705,245\nSeries B Warrants 3,345,961 1,265,822\nTotal $ 14,336,491 $ 5,971,067\nBased on the change in the estimated fair value of the Series A and Series B warrants from November 17, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a gain of\n$8,365,424.\nThe following represents the activity associated with the May 2023 Notes, May 2023 Warrants and Series A and Series B Warrants for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nMay 2023 Notes and Series A and Series B\nMay 2023 Warrants Warrants\nFair value on issuance date $ 18,369,849 14,336,491\nGain on changes in fair value (5,107,794) (8,365,424)\nReclassification to equity (13,262,055) –\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ – $ 5,971,067\nThe total gain on the changes in fair value of $13,473,218 is recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.\n55\nNOTE 8 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nDuring 2022, the Company issued purchase orders and made prepayments for prototype parts of $21,860 to a vendor that Pink Possum, LLC (“Pink Possum”), an entity\ncontrolled by Mr. Okonsky, one of the Company’s founders, Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer, holds an equity interest of 25% as of December 31, 2023.\nThis vendor is expected to provide additional prototype and product parts for a prototype of an upgraded version of the Stag expected to be released in the future.\nIn November 2020, the Company entered into an operating lease with an entity controlled by the Company’s two founders for its future headquarters and production facility in\nLiberty Hill, Texas. The lease had a lease term of 5 years, and monthly payments ranging from approximately $15,000 per month to $17,000 per month over the lease term and\ngave the Company access to the land for use in testing its vehicles prior to the construction of any facilities. In February 2021, the Company entered into an amendment of the\nlease related to its future headquarters to expand the leased premises. The Company paid an additional security deposit of $139,230 and additional prepaid rent of $315,588.\nThe total minimum lease payments under the amended lease totaled approximately $3,930,170.\nIn October 2021, the Company began discussions for an additional amendment to the lease, in anticipation of manufacturing the Stag at this location, which would have\nresulted in the monthly payment increasing to $100,000 for the first year of the lease and increasing annually throughout the term of the lease to $107,000 in the final year.\nMonthly payments for the initial lease and the amended agreement would have begun at the time a certificate of occupancy was received by the landlord.\nThe Company evaluated the cost of this facility in relation to other lower cost options, including having a third party manufacturer the Stag, and determined that it would be in\nthe best interest of the Company to terminate this lease. On April 27, 2022, the Company informed the landlord that it would be terminating the lease. On May 27, 2022, the\nlandlord notified the Company that the landlord would refund $85,756 of the prepaid rent and security deposit balance of $601,818 paid by the Company. The unrefunded\nportion of the prepaid rent and security deposit related to some survey, architecture and construction design costs that were incurred by the landlord prior to the Company\nterminating the lease. In September and October 2023, the landlord notified the Company that there were additional costs that exceeded the amount of the refund and the\nlandlord released the Company from paying any amounts in excess of the original expected refund. The landlord also released the Company from any remaining obligations\nunder the lease and amendments. The Company has recognized a loss on the termination of this lease of $85,756 and $247,525 in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nTotal amortization expense for the right-of-use asset recorded for the initial lease for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $61,709. There was no amortization expense\nrecorded in 2023.\nIn June 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with a company controlled by the Company’s Chairman and co-founder to lease office space for $2,000 per month for a\nperiod of one year. In May 2022, the Company informed the landlord that it would terminate this lease, and the landlord confirmed that the lease terminated effective\nSeptember 1, 2022. Total expense recorded for this lease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $4,000 and $16,000, respectively.\nOn August 28, 2020, the Company entered into three-year consulting agreements with Pink Possum, and Highbridge Consultants, LLC (“Highbridge”), an entity controlled by\nMr. Adrian James, a co-founder of the Company, pursuant to which Messrs. Okonsky and James provide the Company with services. In consideration for entering into the\nconsulting agreements, the Company issued the two entities ten-year warrants to purchase the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.90 per share. The number of\nshares of common stock issuable pursuant to the warrants was based on the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding at the time of exercise and provided\nthat Pink Possum and Highbridge would receive 18.75% and 25%, respectively, of the Company’s shares of common stock outstanding at the time of exercise on a fully diluted\nbasis. On March 26, 2021 and March 25, 2021, respectively, Pink Possum and Highbridge entered into amendments to the consulting agreements agreeing to exchange the\noriginal warrants for new ten-year warrants to purchase 21,112 and 27,778 shares, respectively, of common stock at an exercise price of $220.50. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, the Company recognized compensation expenses of $5.6 million and $7.4 million for the warrants issued to Pink Possum and Highbridge, respectively. On\nDecember 20, 2021, Highbridge exercised all of its warrants on a cashless basis and the Company issued 24,479 shares of common stock to Highbridge.\n56\nIn addition, pursuant to the consulting agreements, upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined below) for an aggregate gross sales price of $100.0 million or\nmore, each entity will receive a cash payment equal to 1% of such gross sales price. For the purposes of the consulting agreements, “Fundamental Transaction” means any of\nthe following: (i) a consolidation or merger involving the Company if the holders of the voting securities of the Company that are outstanding immediately prior to the\nconsummation of such consolidation or merger do not, immediately after the consummation of such consolidation or merger, hold voting securities that collectively possess at\nleast a majority of the voting power of all the outstanding securities of the surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or such surviving entity’s parent entity; (ii) a transfer\nor issuance (in a single transaction or series of related transactions) by one or more of the Company and its stockholders to one person or to any group of persons acting in\nconcert, of shares of the Company’s capital stock then collectively possessing 50% or more of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of the Company’s capital stock\n(computed on an as-converted to common stock basis); or (iii) any sale, license, lease, assignment or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.\nFurthermore, commencing upon the completion of the Company’s initial public offering of the shares of our common stock, if the Company’s market capitalization exceeds\n$300.0 million for a period of 21 consecutive trading days, each of the entities will receive an additional cash payment equal to $15.0 million; provided that the Company will\nhave the right, in its sole discretion, to make the foregoing $15.0 million payment by the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock. The foregoing amounts will be\npayable to the entities if the above milestones occur any time prior to the ten-year anniversary of the original consulting agreements, or August 28, 2030.\nIn December 2022, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Okonsky whereby Mr. Okonsky became an employee on January 2, 2023 and the consulting\nagreement with Pink Possum was terminated. However, the warrants to Pink Possum, and the provisions for a Fundamental Transaction and the market capitalization thresholds\nand related payments owed to Pink Possum if these were to occur remain in effect subsequent to the employment agreement. Mr. Okonsky informed the Company on January\n27, 2024 that he would forfeit his salary and benefits effective February 1, 2024.\nIn March 2024, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Okonsky and he is entitled to a monthly fee of $5,000 and payment of 1% of the gross proceeds\nfrom any merger, sale or change of control transaction (as determined by the board of directors) entered by the Company for a period of up to 6 months following the\ntermination of the consulting agreement. This consulting agreement terminates any remaining provisions of the Pink Possum agreement noted above other than the warrants\nremain outstanding.\nNOTE 9 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOn June 14, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved an increase in the Company’s authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 250,000,000. In addition, the\nCompany is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.00001.

The underwriter agreement provided the underwriter with a right of first refusal for any additional\nsecurities third-parties offerings within twelve months of this offering.\n57\nAs discussed in Note 6 above, on May 24, 2023, the Company issued the May 2023 Notes and May 2023 Warrants, along with the warrants to the placement agent in August\n2022 with the issuance of the Convertible Notes. The Company received consent from the underwriter to issue such securities. In addition, the Company was required to reserve\n480,516 shares of common stock for future issuance of shares for the conversion of the May 2023 Notes and exercise of the May 2023 Warrants and 2,684 shares for the\nexercise of the placement agent warrants.\nNovember 2023 Common Units and Pre-Funded Warrant Units\nOn November 17, 2023, the Company sold (i) 73,913 common units (“Common Units”), each consisting of one share of the Company’s common stock, a Series A warrant to\npurchase one share of common stock at an initial exercise price of $24.75 per share or pursuant to an alternative cashless exercise option (described below), which warrant will\nexpire on the five-year anniversary of the original issuance date (the “Series A Warrants”) and a Series B warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an initial exercise\nprice of $37.80 per share, which warrant will expire on the five-year anniversary of the original issuance date (the “Series B Warrants” and together with the Series A Warrants,\nthe “Warrants”); and (ii) 878,469 pre-funded units (the “Pre-funded Units” and together with the Common Units, the “Units”), each consisting of one pre-funded warrant to\npurchase one share of common stock (the “Pre-funded Warrants”), a Series A Warrant and a Series B Warrant. The purchase price of each Common Unit was $18.90, and the\npurchase price of each Pre-Funded Unit was $18.8996. The Pre-Funded Warrants are immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded\nWarrants are exercised in full. As of December 31, 2023, 804,618 of the Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised and the remaining Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised by\nJanuary 9, 2024.\nIn addition, the Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase additional 142,858 shares of common stock and/or Pre-Funded Warrants, representing up to 15%\nof the number of common stock and Pre-Funded Warrants sold in the Public Offering, and/or additional 18,724 Series A Warrants representing up to 15% of the Series A\nWarrants sold in the Public Offering, and/or additional 18,724 Series B Warrants representing up to 15% of the Series B Warrants sold in the Public Offering solely to cover\nover-allotments, if any. The underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option with respect to 18,724 Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants. A total of 352,057 each of\nSeries A and B Warrants were issued in the transaction. The net proceeds were approximately $16.2 million (gross proceeds of $18.0 million less fees and expenses of $1.8\nmillion). The gross proceeds and transaction cost were allocated to each of the instruments issued in the offering at their estimated relative fair values. Transaction costs totaling\n$1,444,547 related to the Series A and Series B Warrants were expensed since these warrants were determined to be liabilities and recorded at their estimated fair values (see\nNote 7).\nSeries A Warrants\nEach Series A Warrant has an initial exercise price per share equal to $24.75, was immediately exercisable upon issuance, and will expire on the five-year anniversary of the\noriginal issuance date, or November 17, 2028.\nShare Combination Event Adjustments\nConditioned upon the receipt of the Warrant Stockholder Approval at a required special meeting of stockholders (“Special Meeting”), if at any time on or after the date of\nissuance there occurs any share split, share dividend, share combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving the Company’s common stock (collectively a\n“Share Event”) and the lowest daily VWAP during the five consecutive trading days prior to the date of such event and the five consecutive trading days after the date of such\nevent is less than the exercise price then in effect, then the exercise price of the Series A Warrant shall be reduced to the lowest daily VWAP during such period and the number\nof warrant shares issuable shall be increased such that the aggregate exercise price payable thereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the exercise price, shall be equal\nto the aggregate exercise price on the date of issuance. As discussed in Note 14 below, approval of this adjustment by the stockholders was made on January 12, 2024.\nCashless Exercise\nIf at the time a holder exercises its Series A Warrants, a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of common stock underlying the Series A Warrants under the\nSecurities Act is not then effective or available and an exemption from registration under the Securities Act is not available for the issuance of such shares, then in lieu of\nmaking the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to us upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder may elect instead to receive upon\nsuch exercise (either in whole or in part) the net number of shares of common stock determined according to a formula set forth in the Series A Warrants.\n58\nConditioned upon the receipt of the Warrant Stockholder Approval at a required Special Meeting, a holder of Series A Warrants may also provide notice and elect an\n“alternative cashless exercise” pursuant to which they would receive an aggregate number of shares equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of common stock\nthat would be issuable upon a cash exercise of the Series A Warrant and (y) 3.0. As discussed in Note 14 below, approval of this adjustment by the stockholders was made on\nJanuary 12, 2024.\nAdjustments and Activity Subsequent to December 31, 2023\nAs discussed in Note 14, the Company completed a 1 for 45 reverse stock split on February 2, 2024. Prior to this reverse split, 18,941 Series A Warrants were exercised under\nthe alternative cashless exercise provision in the period from January 1, 2024 to February 2, 2024. As a result of the reverse stock split, the total number of Series A Warrants\nand exercise price for the remaining warrants was adjusted per the provisions of a Share Event and the total number of Series A Warrants became 3,979,955 and the exercise\nprice became $1.8646. A total of 3,937,910 of the Series A Warrants were exercised under the alternative cashless exercise provision and 42,045 remain outstanding as of\nMarch 27, 2024.\nSeries B Warrants\nEach Series B Warrant offered has an initial exercise price per share equal to $37.80, was immediately exercisable upon issuance, and will expire on the five-year anniversary\nof the original issuance date, or November 17, 2028.\nAnti-Dilution Provisions\nSubject to certain exemptions outlined in the Series B Warrant, for the life of the warrant, if the Company sells, enters into an agreement to sell, or grants any option to\npurchase, or sells, enters into an agreement to sell, or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise disposes of or issue (or announce any offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase\nor other disposition) any common stock or convertible security, at an effective price per share less than the exercise price of the Series B Warrant then in effect (a “Dilutive\nIssuance”), the exercise price of the Series B Warrant will be reduced to an amount equal to the lowest daily VWAP during the period commencing five consecutive trading\ndays following the Dilutive Issuance, subject to a floor price of $0.13; provided that upon the receipt of the Warrant Stockholder Approval at a required Special Meeting, the\nfloor price will be removed and, upon a Dilutive Issuance, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Series B Warrant shall be proportionally adjusted so that the\naggregate exercise price of the Series B Warrant shall remain unchanged. As discussed in Note 14 below, approval of this adjustment by the stockholders was made on January\n12, 2024.\nIn addition, conditioned upon the receipt of the Warrant Stockholder Approval at the Special Meeting, for the life of the Series B Warrant, the Company may voluntarily reduce\nthe exercise price of the Series B Warrant. The Company refers to this price adjustment feature as the “Voluntary Adjustment Provision”. As discussed in Note 14 below,\napproval of this adjustment by the stockholders was made on January 12, 2024.\nShare Combination Event Adjustments\nConditioned upon the receipt of the Warrant Stockholder Approval, if at any time on or after the date of issuance there occurs any share split, share dividend, share combination,\nrecapitalization or other similar transaction involving the Company’s common stock (collectively a “Share Event”) and the lowest daily VWAP during the five consecutive\ntrading days prior to the date of such event and the five consecutive trading days after the date of such event is less than the exercise price then in effect, then the exercise price\nof the Series B Warrant shall be reduced to the lowest daily VWAP during such period and the number of warrant shares issuable shall be increased such that the aggregate\nexercise price payable thereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the exercise price, shall be equal to the aggregate exercise price on the date of issuance. As discussed\nin Note 14 below, approval of this adjustment by the stockholders was made on January 12, 2024.\n59\nAdjustments and Activity Subsequent to December 31, 2023\nAs discussed in Note 14, the Company completed a 1 for 45 reverse stock split on February 2, 2024. Prior to this reverse split, no Series B Warrants had been exercised. As a\nresult of the reverse stock split, the total number of Series B Warrants and exercise price for the remaining warrants was adjusted per the provisions of a Share Event and the\ntotal number of Series B Warrants became 7,137,082 and the exercise price became $1.8646. A total of 70,000 of the Series B Warrants were exercised and 7,067,062 remained\noutstanding as of March 4, 2024, when the Company exchanged the May 2023 Notes for Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with a conversion price of $1.33 per share, as\ndiscussed further in Note 14. As a result of this exchange, the Series B Warrant amounts and exercise price were further adjusted based on the Anti-Dilution Provisions and the\nnew number of Series B Warrants is 14,546,024 and the exercise price is $0.9059. As of March 27, 2024, 14,546,024 of the Series B Warrants remain outstanding.\nOther Warrants\nAs discussed in Note 6, the Company issued the Note Warrants, which were fully vested, to purchase 40,258 shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial exercise price\nof $641.25. The Note Warrants expire August 24, 2027. Also, the Company issued to the placement agent of the Convertible Notes, fully vested warrants to purchase 2,684\nshares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $801.5625. The warrants were not exercisable until February 24, 2023 and expire on February 24, 2028. The\nCompany valued all of these warrants using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on August 24, 2022 of $549.00, volatility of 79.81% based on peer companies,\nrisk free interest rate of 3.03%, no dividends and an estimated life of 2.5 years.\nIn May 2023, all of the Note Warrants to purchase 40,258 shares of the Company’s common stock were exchanged for Exchange Warrants to purchase 75,814 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock with an initial exercise price of $245.25 per share (which was adjusted to $168.75 per share upon stockholder approval which was received on\nAugust 3, 2023). The Exchange Warrants expire August 24, 2027.

As discussed above, the exercise price of the Exchange Warrants and New Warrants were adjusted to $61.605 per share in October 2023 due to the 1 for 5\nreverse stock split. Due to the exchange of the May 2023 Notes for Series A convertible preferred stock as discussed further in Note 14 below, the exercise price of the\nExchange and New Warrants was adjusted to $1.33.\nAs noted below, 6,824 of the Exchange Warrants were exercised at a price of $78.75 per share and 6,824 Reload Warrants were issued with an exercise price of $112.50 per\nshare. In October 2023, the Reload warrant exercise price was reduced to $61.605. The Reload warrants expire August 24, 2027.

In consideration for entering into the Amendment No. 1, the Company agreed to issue GLV (or its designee) five-year warrants to\npurchase 8,889 shares of Company common stock with an exercise price of $94.50 per share, which was equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date\nof the Amendment No. 1, 4,445 shares were fully vested upon issuance and the remaining warrants vested 45 days from the issuance date.\n60\nWarrant Inducements\nOn October 13, 2023, the Company entered into an inducement offer letter agreement (the “Inducement Letter”) with the three holders (each, a “Holder”) of the May 2023\nWarrants. The Company agreed to reduce the exercise price of up to 21,623 to the lesser of (i) $78.75 (after giving effect to the 1:5 reverse stock split that went into effect on\nOctober 13, 2023) and (ii) the exercise price in effect at the time of exercise of the Existing Warrants if further adjusted in accordance with the terms of the May 2023 Warrants\n($61.605 per share after adjustment for the lowest day’s VWAP for the five days following the reverse stock split). The reduction of the exercise price of such Existing Warrants\nremained in effect until October 27, 2023 (the “Inducement Period”). The exercise price for any Warrants not exercised prior to the end of the Inducement Period would not\nresult in a change in the exercise price under the original terms of the Existing Warrants. The Holders exercised 6,824 warrants of the 21,623 warrants available for exercise.\nDue to the exchange of the May 2023 Notes for Series A convertible preferred stock as discussed further in Note 14 below, the exercise price of the warrants issued for those\nexercised in the Inducement Period were adjusted to $1.33.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Inducement Letter, the Holders who exercise such Existing Warrants for cash on or prior to October 27, 2023 would receive a new warrant (“Reload\nWarrant”) to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock exercised under the Existing Warrants. The exercise price of the\nReload Warrants was determined based on the terms of the Existing Warrants, which was $61.605 per share. On October 20, 2023, the Holders exercised 2,332 warrants at\n$61.605 per share. Due to the exchange of the May 2023 Notes for Series A convertible preferred stock as discussed further in Note 14 below, the exercise price of the Reload\nWarrants was adjusted to $1.33.\nOn October 29, 2023, in an effort to raise cash, the Company entered into an inducement offer letter agreement (the “Inducement Reprice Letter”) with the Holders of the\nCompany’s May 2023 Warrants. Pursuant to the Inducement Reprice Letter, in exchange for an aggregate cash payment of $346,500, the Company reduced the exercise price\nwith respect to May 2023 Warrants exercisable into an aggregate of 7,778 shares of common stock from $61.605 per share to $0.45 per share.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports\nwe file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the appropriate time periods, and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial\nofficer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. We, under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nExchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has determined that internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective as the material weaknesses identified by our independent registered public\naccounting firm in our internal control over financial reporting in our 2020 audit have not been remediated as of December 31, 2023. These material weaknesses are as follows:\n· Inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel\n· Insufficient formal written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, financial reporting and record keeping\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the\nSEC for an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business\nStartups Act of 2012\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a \"Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9C.

This summary is not complete, and is qualified by reference to our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated by reference\nherein. We encourage you to read our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and the applicable provisions of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporations Law for additional information.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue 255,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 250,000,000 shares of common stock, par\nvalue $0.00001 per share and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share.\nCommon Stock\nShares of our common stock have the following rights, preferences and privileges:\nVoting\nEach holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Any action at a meeting at\nwhich a quorum is present will be decided by a majority of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy, except in the case of any election of directors, which\nwill be decided by a plurality of votes cast. There is no cumulative voting.\nDividends\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for payment, subject to\nthe rights of holders, if any, of any class of stock having preference over the common stock. Any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our\nboard of directors. Our board of directors may or may not determine to declare dividends in the future. The board’s determination to issue dividends will depend upon our\nprofitability and financial condition, any contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and the SEC, and other factors that our board of directors deems\nrelevant.\nLiquidation Rights\nIn the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably on\nthe basis of the number of shares held in any of the assets available for distribution after we have paid in full, or provided for payment of, all of our debts and after the holders\nof all outstanding series of any class of stock have preference over the common stock, if any, have received their liquidation preferences in full.\nOther\nOur issued and outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. Holders of shares of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights.\nShares of our common stock are not convertible into shares of any other class of capital stock, nor are they subject to any redemption or sinking fund provisions.\nPreferred Stock\nWe are authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board to issue these shares in\none or more series, to determine the designations and the powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and the qualifications, limitations and\nrestrictions thereof, including the dividend rights, conversion or exchange rights, voting rights (including the number of votes per share), redemption rights and terms,\nliquidation preferences, sinking fund provisions and the number of shares constituting the series. Our board of directors could, without stockholder approval, issue preferred\nstock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of common stock which could have the effect of making it more\ndifficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.\n1\nIn March 2024, we issued 24,680 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which shares are convertible into Company common stock at an initial conversion price of $1.33\nper share (“Conversion Price”), subject to potential future adjustment if the Company makes certain dilutive issuances or upon the completion of a reverse split transaction, on\nan as-converted basis at an assumed conversion price of the greater of the Conversion Price or $0.98 per share. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the\nCompany, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out of the assets, whether capital or surplus, of the Company available to shareholders, an amount\nequal to the greater of: (i) $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock then held, or (ii) the amount the holders would have received had the holders fully converted the Series\nA Preferred Stock to Company common stock, in each case, before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of the Company’s common stock.\nWarrants\nBelow is a summary of our material warrants outstanding (share and per share amounts adjusted for the reverse 1 for 5 and 1 for 45 stock splits completed on October\n13, 2025 and February 2, 2024):\nRelated Party Warrants\nOn August 28, 2020, the Company entered into consulting agreements with Pink Possum LLC (“Pink Possum”), an entity controlled by Christian Okonsky and\nHighbridge Consultants, LLC (“Highbridge”), an entity controlled by Adrian James, the Company’s founders, pursuant to which Messrs. Okonsky and James provide the\nCompany with services. In consideration for entering into the consulting agreements, the Company issued the two entities ten-year warrants to purchase the Company’s\ncommon stock at an exercise price of $0.90 per share. The number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the warrants was based on the number of shares of the\nCompany’s common stock outstanding at the time of exercise and provided that Pink Possum and Highbridge would receive 18.75% and 25%, respectively, of the Company’s\nshares of common stock outstanding at the time of exercise on a fully diluted basis. On March 26, 2021 and March 25, 2021, respectively, Pink Possum and Highbridge entered\ninto amendments to the consulting agreements agreeing to exchange the original warrants for new ten-year warrants to purchase 20,312 and 37,778 shares, respectively, of\ncommon stock at an exercise price of $220.50, of which, as of December 31, 2023, only the warrants issued to Pink Possum remain outstanding.\nSeries A and Series B Warrant\nOur public offering completed in November 2023 included Series A and Series B warrants (“Series A Warrants” and “Series B Warrants”) to purchase our common\nstock with initial exercise prices of $24.75 and $37.80, respectively. As of March 27, 2023, approximately 42,000 and 14.5 million Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants,\nrespectively, remain outstanding and the Series A Warrants have an exercise price of $1.8636 and the Series B Warrants have an exercise price of $0.9059. Series A Warrants\nmay be exercised on an alternative cash basis where each warrant exercised will result in the Company issuing three shares of common stock.\nThe Series B Warrants provide, subject to certain exemptions, that if we sell or issue, any common stock or convertible securities, at an effective price per share less\nthan the exercise price of the Series B Warrant then in effect, or a Dilutive Issuance, the exercise price of the Series B Warrant will be reduced to an amount equal to the lowest\ndaily volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) during the period commencing five consecutive trading days following the Dilutive Issuance and the number of shares issuable\nupon exercise of the Series B Warrant shall be proportionally adjusted so that the aggregate exercise price of the Series B Warrant shall remain unchanged.\nFurther, if at any time on or after the date of issuance there occurs any share split, share dividend, share combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction\ninvolving our common stock and the lowest daily VWAP during the five consecutive trading days prior to the date of such event and the five consecutive trading days after the\ndate of such event is less than the exercise price then in effect, then the exercise price shall be reduced to the lowest daily VWAP during such period and the number of warrant\nshares issuable shall be increased such that the aggregate exercise price payable thereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the exercise price, shall be equal to the\naggregate exercise price on the date of issuance.\n2\nCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include a number of anti-takeover provisions that may have the effect of encouraging persons\nconsidering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. These\nprovisions include:\nAdvance Notice Requirements. Our bylaws establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for\nelection as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely and given in\nwriting to our corporate Secretary. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at our principal executive offices not fewer than 120 calendar days prior to the first\nanniversary date on which our notice of meeting and related proxy statement were mailed to stockholders in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting of\nstockholders. The notice must contain the information required by the bylaws, including information regarding the proposal and the proponent.\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time by\nonly the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the board of directors.\nNo Written Consent of Stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders\nmust be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders.\nAmendment of Bylaws. Our stockholders may amend any provisions of our bylaws by obtaining the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting\npower of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company with the power to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nPreferred Stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to create and issue rights entitling our stockholders to purchase\nshares of our stock or other securities. The ability of our board to establish the rights and issue substantial amounts of preferred stock without the need for stockholder approval\nmay delay or deter a change in control of us. See the section titled “Preferred Stock” above.\nDelaware Takeover Statute\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any “business combination” (as\ndefined below) with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless: (1) prior to such\ndate, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\n(2) on consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of\nthe corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding those shares owned (x) by persons who\nare directors and also officers and (y) by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to\nthis plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or (3) on or subsequent to such date, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an\nannual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2⁄3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the\ninterested stockholder.\nSection 203 of the DGCL defines generally “business combination” to include: (1) any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested\nstockholder; (2) any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested stockholder; (3) subject to certain\nexceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested stockholder; (4) any transaction involving\nthe corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or\n(5) the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or through the corporation. In\ngeneral, Section 203 defines an “interested stockholder” as any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any\nentity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person.\n3\nLimitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws limit the liability of our officers and directors and provide that we will indemnify our officers and\ndirectors, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL.\nListing\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol “VLCN”.\nTransfer Agent\nThe transfer agent for our common stock is Computershare.\n4\nExhibit 23.1\nCONSENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference in this Registration Statements on Form S-8 (No. 333-261312 and 333-266788), Form S-1 (333-274800, 333-272564 and 333-\n267404) and Form S-3 (No. 333-269644) of our report dated March 28, 2024 with respect to the audited consolidated financial statements of Volcon, Inc. and its subsidiary\n(collectively, the “Company\") appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2023 .\n/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP\nwww.malonebailey.com\nHouston, Texas\nMarch 28, 2024\nExhibit 31.1\nCERTIFICATION BY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\nI, John Kim, certify that:\n1.

Introduction\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Volcon, Inc. (the “Company”) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to adopt a policy providing for\nthe recoupment by the Company of certain Incentive-Based Compensation paid to Executives Officers in the case of a Restatement (as defined below) (the “Policy”). In such\ncase, the Company (a) may recoup the Incentive-Based Compensation that was paid or that vested and (b) may cancel any outstanding or unearned Incentive-Based\nCompensation.\n2. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:\n“Committee” means the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.\n“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation\nthat otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts resulting from a Restatement, and it must be computed without regard to any\ntaxes paid. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to\nmathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement: (a) the amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the\nstock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received; and (b) the Company must maintain documentation of the determination\nof that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n“Executive Officer” means any employee of the Company who is currently, or within the period covered by this Policy, employed as the Company’s president,\nprincipal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal\nbusiness unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a significant policy-making function, or any other person who\nperforms similar significant policy-making functions for the Company, including Executive Officers of the Company’s subsidiaries if they perform such policy making\nfunctions for the Company, and shall include each executive officer as determined under Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K.\n“Financial Reporting Measures” mean those measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the\nCompany’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also Financial\nReporting Measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting\nMeasure. For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure\nspecified in the award is attained, even if the payment or grant occurs after the end of that period.\n1\n“Non-Employee Board” means the members of the Board who are not employed by the Company or any affiliate thereof.\n“Recoupment Rules” means Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n“Restatement” means an accounting restatement required to be prepared by the Company due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial\nreporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to\nthe previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current\nperiod. The date of a Restatement shall be the earlier to occur of: (a) the date the Company’s board of directors, a committee of the board of directors, or the officer or\nofficers of the Company authorized to take such action if board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to\nprepare a Restatement; or (b) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement. The Company’s obligation to\nrecover Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on if or when restated financial statements are filed.\n3. Administration of this Policy\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall have full power and authority to construe and interpret this Policy, and to recommend to\nthe Non-Employee Board its determinations as to whether recoupment is required under the Policy, the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation to recoup from an\nExecutive Officer and whether any other action should be taken pursuant to Section 6 of the Policy. Upon the approval of the Committee’s recommendations by a majority of\nthe members of the Non-Employee Board (even if less than a quorum), the final decision shall be binding and conclusive on all parties.\n4. Recoupment of Incentive Compensation\nIn the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company must recover reasonably promptly the Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nreceived by a person (a) after beginning service as an Executive Officer, (b) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-\nBased Compensation, and (c) during the recovery period described in Section 5 below. Recovery is subject only to those exceptions set forth in the Recoupment Rules.\nThe Committee can recommend that the Non-Employee Board recoup from the Executive Officer all or a portion of the following in order to satisfy the Executive\nOfficer’s recoupment obligation:\nCash Incentive Plan: The Committee can recommend that the Non-Employee Board (i) cancel and forfeit the Executive Officer’s annual or other cash incentive\nopportunity for the then current plan year, and/or (ii) require repayment of any annual or other cash incentive awards previously paid for prior years within the period\ndescribed in Section 5.\nStock Plan: The Committee can recommend that the Non-Employee Board (i) cancel and forfeit any outstanding equity awards under its stock-based plans, (ii)\nrequire the Executive Officer to return a number of shares of Company stock received upon vesting and settlement of any restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards\nduring the period described in Section 5 (or pay the cash value of such shares), and (iii) require the Executive Officer to return a number of shares received upon the exercise\nof any stock options during the period described in Section 5 (or pay the cash value of such shares). The cash value shall be determined as of the date of the Committee’s\ndemand for recoupment.\n2\nThe Committee can also recommend that the Non-Employee Board recoup similar compensation under any subsequently adopted plans, arrangements or\nagreements, or compensation under any severance arrangements or any non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements.\n5. Limitation on Period for Recoupment\nIn the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company must recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by Executive Officers\nduring the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, and any transition period (that results from a\nchange in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\n6. No Impairment of Other Remedies\nThis Policy shall not preclude the Committee from recommending that the Non-Employee Board take any other action to enforce an Executive Officer’s obligation\nto the Company, including termination of employment, institution of civil proceedings, or action to effect criminal proceedings.\n7. Miscellaneous\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any provision of applicable law, including the Recoupment Rules, requires non-discretionary recoupment or would\nresult in a larger recoupment than permitted under this Policy, the provision of such applicable law shall supersede the relevant provisions of this Policy.\n8. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall apply to all Incentive Compensation paid, awarded or granted on or after October 2, 2023.\nPolicy Acknowledgment and Consent\nI hereby acknowledge that I have been designated an Executive Officer, I acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Policy, I agree to fully cooperate with the Company in\nconnection with the enforcement of the Policy, including the repayment by or recovery from me of Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and I agree that the Company may\nenforce its rights under the Policy through any and all reasonable means permitted under applicable law as the Company deems necessary or appropriate under the Policy.\n_________________________________________\nPrinted Name: ______________________________ Date: ____________________________\n3"
