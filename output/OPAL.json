Design Capacity is presented as OPAL’s ownership share (i.e., net of joint venture partners’ ownership) of the facility and is calculated based on the number of days in the period. New facilities that come online during a quarter are pro-rated for the number of days in commercial operation.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  Inlet Design Capacity Utilization is measured as the Volume of Inlet Gas for a period, divided by the total Design Capacity for such period. The Volume of Inlet Gas varies over time depending on, among other factors, (i) the quantity and quality of waste deposited at the landfill, (ii) waste management practices by the landfill, and (iii) the construction, operations and maintenance of the LFG collection system used to recover the LFG. The Design Capacity for each facility will typically be correlated to the amount of LFG expected to be generated by the landfill during the term of the related gas rights agreement. The Company expects Inlet Design Capacity Utilization to be in the range of 75-85% on an aggregate basis over the next several years. Typically, newer facilities perform at the lower end of this range and demonstrate increasing utilization as they mature and the biogas resource increases at open landfills.   \n(3) |  Utilization of Inlet Gas is measured as RNG Fuel Volume Produced divided by the Volume of Inlet Gas. Utilization of Inlet Gas varies over time depending on availability and efficiency of the facility and the quality of LFG (i.e., concentrations of methane, oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases) including the ramp up period for new projects. The Company generally expects Utilization of Inlet Gas to be in the range of 80% to 90%.   \n(4) |  Data not available for the Company’s dairy projects, i.e., Sunoma and Biotown.   \n  \n**RNG Pending Monetization Summary**\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(in thousands, except Average realized sales price)  |  **September 30, 2024**  \n**RNG Fuel** |  **Fuel Station Services** |  **Total**  \n**Stored Gas Metrics (MMBtus)(1)**  \nBeginning balance stored RNG as of June 30, 2024 |  318  |  59  |  377   \nAdd: RNG production  |  1,105  |  119  |  1,224   \nLess: Current period RNG volumes dispensed  |  (1,143  |  )  |  (121  |  )  |  (1,264  |  )   \nEnding Balance stored RNG as of September 30, 2024 |  280  |  57  |  337   \n**Value of ending balance stored RNG using quarter end price(1)** |  **$** |  **12,648** |  **$** |  **6,737** |  **$** |  **19,385**  \n.   \n**RIN Metrics**  \nBeginning balance as of June 30, 2024 |  11  |  5  |  16   \nAdd: Generated in current period  |  10,777  |  3,439  |  14,216   \nLess: Sales  |  (10,719  |  )  |  (3,400  |  )  |  (14,119  |  )   \nEnding RIN credit balance (Available for sale) as of September 30, 2024 |  69  |  44  |  113   \nD3 price per RIN at quarter end  |  $  |  3.52  |  $  |  3.52  |  $  |  3.52   \n**Value of RINs using quarter end price(2)** |  **$** |  **203** |  **$** |  **152** |  **$** |  **355**  \n**LCFS Metrics**  \nBeginning balance (net share) as of June 30, 2024 |  4  |  46  |  50   \nAdd: Generated in current period  |  13  |  27  |  40   \nLess: Sales  |  (12  |  )  |  (3  |  )  |  (15  |  )   \nEnding LCFS credit balance (Available for sale) as of September 30, 2024 |  5  |  70  |  75   \nLCFS credit price at quarter end  |  $  |  66.50  |  $  |  66.50  |  $  |  66.50   \n**Value of LCFSs using quarter end price(2)** |  **$** |  **509** |  **$** |  **2,799** |  **$** |  **3,308**  \n**Value of RECs using quarter end price** |  **$** |  **62**  \n**Other Metrics**  \nAverage realized sales price - RIN  |  —  |  —  |  $  |  3.22   \nAverage realized sales price - LCFS  |  —  |  —  |  $  |  100.00   \n**Total Value of RNG Pending Monetization at quarter end** |  **$** |  **13,360** |  **$** |  **9,688** |  **$** |  **23,110**  \n  \n(1) |  Reflects OPAL’s ownership share of stored RNG (i.e., net of joint venture partners’ ownership) including equity method investments.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  Reflects OPAL’s ownership share of RIN and LCFS credits (i.e., net of joint venture partners’ ownership) including equity method investments and presented net of discounts and any direct transaction costs such as dispensing fees, third-party royalties and transaction costs as applicable.   \n  \n**Liquidity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our liquidity was $285.3 million, consisting of $254.3 million of availability under the above referenced credit facility, and $31.0 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have drawn approximately $231.6 million, and utilized $14.1 million of our revolver availability for letters of credit, under the $500 million senior secured credit facility we entered into in September 2023. \n\nWe believe our liquidity and anticipated cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet our existing funding needs. \n\n**Capital Expenditures**\n\nDuring the nine months of 2024, OPAL Fuels invested $72.8 million across RNG projects in construction and OPAL Fuels proprietary fueling stations in construction as compared to $92.3 million in the prior year. \n\nIn addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our portion of capital expenditures in unconsolidated entities was $22.8 million.

Exchange Commission. We believe these measures provide important supplemental information to investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results. We use these measures, together with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP” or “U.S. GAAP”), for internal managerial purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. However, we do not, and you should not, rely on non-GAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations, that when taken together with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures that we also provide, give a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We strongly encourage you to review all of our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not solely rely on any single non-GAAP financial measure. \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are limited as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s GAAP results. The Company expects to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures, adjusting for the items described below (and/or other items that may arise in the future as the Company’s management deems appropriate), and the Company expects to continue to incur expenses, charges or gains like the non-GAAP adjustments described below. Accordingly, unless expressly stated otherwise, the exclusion of these and other similar items in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measure as indicators of operating performance. Moreover, because not all companies use identical measures and calculations, the Company’s presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. We strongly encourage you to review all of our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not solely rely on any single non-GAAP financial measure. \n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nTo supplement the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses a non-GAAP financial measure that it calls adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”). This non-GAAP financial measure adjusts net income for interest and financing expense, net, loss on debt extinguishment, net (income) loss attributable to non-redeemable non-controlling interests, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, adjustments to reflect Adjusted EBITDA from equity method investments, loss on warrant exchange, unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, non-cash charges, one-time non-recurring expenses, major maintenance on Renewable Power, gain on deconsolidation of VIEs, project development and startup costs, incremental virtual pipeline costs at Prince William RNG facility due to their temporary nature, and ITC proceeds, net of expenses. \n\nManagement believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information about the Company’s performance, for the following reasons: (1) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management to assess the Company’s operating performance and make financial and operational decisions; (2) the measure excludes the effect of items that management believes are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating performance and may obscure trends in the business; (3) the measure better aligns revenues with expenses; and (4) the measure is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company’s business. In future quarters, the Company may adjust for other expenditures, charges or gains to present non-GAAP financial measures that the Company’s management believes are indicative of the Company’s core operating performance. \n\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of our Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA: \n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP Net income to Adjusted EBITDA** **For the Three and Nine

The new facility will have an initial annual design capacity of approximately 0.66 million MMBtus and is 100% owned by OPAL Fuels. \n\nUsing proven technology, the project will capture biogas produced naturally from the decomposition of organic material from the Kirby Canyon Landfill and convert it into renewable natural gas (“RNG”), a low-carbon, low-cost transportation fuel. Approximately 5.1 million gas gallons equivalent (“GGE”) of RNG can be produced annually based on the design capacity of the plant. OPAL Fuels will distribute the RNG via its fueling station network to heavy-duty trucks that run on natural gas instead of diesel to help lower emissions from, and reduce fuel costs for, these fleets. \n\nThe Kirby RNG facility strengthens OPAL’s mission of providing “Cleaner, Cheaper, Now” sustainable energy solutions that generate environmental, social, and economic benefits for partners, fleet customers, and the local communities they serve. \n\n“Beginning construction of our 17th RNG project, our first in California, continues the OPAL execution story of moving projects from development, through construction and into operations,” said Jonathan Maurer, co-CEO, OPAL Fuels. \n\n**About OPAL Fuels Inc.**\n\n[OPAL Fuels Inc.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opalfuels.com&esheet=54147754&newsitemid=20241106306582&lan=en-US&anchor=OPAL+Fuels+Inc.&index=2&md5=5c1cdfb6dd7d717b082a5dd570d91226) (Nasdaq: OPAL) is a leader in the capture and conversion of biogas into low carbon intensity RNG and renewable electricity.

(Nasdaq: OPAL) today announced the start of commercial operations at its renewable natural gas (RNG) facility at the Polk County municipal landfill in Jones Corner, Florida, marking the company’s eleventh operational RNG project and second facility in the state. Owned and operated by Polk County’s municipal government, the landfill is now providing biogas to OPAL’s RNG project which is producing and injecting pipeline-quality RNG. \n\nWith a nameplate design capacity of approximately 1.1 million MMBtu (8.5 million gasoline gallon equivalents) of RNG per year, the product RNG will be primarily used to replace diesel transportation fuel to lower fleet operating costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting in a significant impact on public health and the environment. This reduction is equivalent to achieving zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from over 900 heavy-duty trucks. \n\nThe commercial operations of OPAL’s Polk County RNG facility represents a significant step forward for OPAL Fuels' mission of providing “Cleaner, Cheaper, Now” fuel solutions. This initiative is crucial in promoting sustainable energy solutions that benefit both the environment and the economy. \n\n“Polk County’s partnership with OPAL Fuels demonstrates our commitment to Polk County’s residents,” said Polk County Board Chairman Bill Braswell. “Polk County is leveraging the by-product of waste breakdown and, at the same time, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. With the plant OPAL Fuels has constructed, landfill biogas will be turned into renewable natural gas, which can be used for fuel to power waste trucks, and provide energy for homes, and businesses. This is a win-win for taxpayers and the environment.” \n\n“Polk County represents our eleventh operational RNG project and our third to commence commercial operations this year,” said Adam Comora, co-CEO of OPAL Fuels. “Including Polk County and our recent [announcement](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.opalfuels.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fgfl-environmental-and-opal-fuels-begin-commercial-operations&esheet=54145082&newsitemid=20241031763820&lan=en-US&anchor=announcement&index=1&md5=4d82cd47eab2d853ccc08b6158fdba9c) with GFL at the Sapphire project, we have approximately 8.8 million MMBtu of annual nameplate design capacity in operation, up 5.0 million MMBtu since becoming a public company in 2022.” \n\n“We’re pleased with the progress we’ve made as the largest publicly traded integrated RNG operator in North America.
