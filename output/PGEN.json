We are excited about our imminent submission of a BLA for PRGN-2012 in RRP as we have finalized our pre-BLA meetings and are aligned with the FDA on the content for all modules and plan for submission in the fourth quarter. Our commercial and manufacturing readiness campaigns for PRGN-2012 are well underway to support a potential 2025 launch,\" said Helen Sabzevari, PhD, President and CEO of Precigen. \"Although our primary focus is on PRGN-2012, we continue to demonstrate the many advantages of the UltraCAR-T platform over conventional CAR-Ts. Our recent data presentation at SITC for our next generation UltraCAR-T targeting CD19 reinforces the potential to be the best-in-class CD19-targeting medicine in oncology and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus nephritis. We are excited about the potential of this platform and the strategic partnership discussions that currently are underway.\"\n\n\"Following our reprioritization and public equity offering announced in August, we remain focused on fiscal management while appropriately investing in activities necessary for the potential launch of PRGN-2012. We are making good progress on a number of potential financing options, including strategic partnerships and other transactions. We will update our investors on this progress in the coming months,\" said Harry Thomasian Jr., CFO of Precigen.\n\n**Key Program Highlights**\n\n**PRGN-2012 AdenoVerse ® Gene Therapy in RRP**\n\n  * PRGN-2012 is an investigational off-the-shelf AdenoVerse gene therapy designed to elicit immune responses directed against cells infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) 6 or HPV 11 for the treatment of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP).

These advantages give Precigen's CD19 UltraCAR-T the potential to be the best-in-class treatment for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune indications for the proven CD19 target.\n  * Preclinical data for PRGN-3008 were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 39th Annual Meeting in a poster presentation titled, \"_[Non-viral engineered next generation CD19 UltraCAR-T with membrane bound IL-15 (mbIL15) and PD-1 blockade preserves stem cell memory/naïve phenotype and enhances anti-tumor efficacy](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302765-1&h=3852472751&u=https%3A%2F%2Fjitc.bmj.com%2Fcontent%2F12%2FSuppl_2%2FA266&a=Non-viral+engineered+next+generation+CD19+UltraCAR-T+with+membrane+bound+IL-15+\\(mbIL15\\)+and+PD-1+blockade+preserves+stem+cell+memory%2Fna%C3%AFve+phenotype+and+enhances+anti-tumor+efficacy)_.\"\n    * Preclinical data showed that in  _in vivo_ tumor models, a single administration of PRGN-3008 enhanced expansion and persistence, produced robust antitumor efficacy with complete tumor clearance, and demonstrated significantly longer survival compared to conventional CD19 CAR-T cells.\n    * In a simulation of tumor relapse in the  _in vivo_ model, PRGN-3008 demonstrated persistence and long-term antitumor immunity extending overall survival without additional PRGN-3008 treatment.\n  * In a humanized mouse model of lupus nephritis, additional preclinical data for PRGN-3008 in an autoimmune setting presented at the 2024 Cell and Gene Meeting on the Mesa showed complete elimination of B-cells as well as a decrease in antibodies to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), a specific marker of lupus.\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n  * The Company closed a public offering of its common stock in August 2024, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $30.9 million (after deducting underwriting discounts, fees and other underwriting expenses).\n  * In August 2024, the Company began a strategic prioritization of its clinical portfolio and streamlining of its resources, including a reduction of over 20% of its workforce, to focus on potential commercialization of PRGN-2012.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Compared to Prior Year Period**\n\nSG&A expenses increased by $0.6 million, or 7%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a result of the Company's increased focus on PRGN-2012, commercial readiness costs increased in the current quarter versus the prior year period. In addition, the third quarter of 2024 included severance costs incurred related to the Precigen workforce reduction. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in insurance expenses due to decreasing rates and professional fees incurred related to general corporate matters compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $0.2 million, or 2%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of the Company's portfolio reprioritization, which included a $2.0 million decrease in costs associated with ActoBio resulting from the shutdown of operations during the second quarter of 2024 as well as lower costs of $0.7 million incurred at contract research organizations for other programs compared to the same period in 2023. These decreases were offset by increased costs of approximately $2.5 million associated with PRGN-2012 in advance of the Company's planned BLA submission and the Company's ongoing confirmatory trial, as well as severance costs incurred related to the Precigen workforce reduction in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOther income (expense), net, decreased by $3.8 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of cumulative translation losses of $2.9 million as a result of the final closing of the ActoBio facilities in the third quarter of 2024, as well as a reduction in interest income compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nTotal revenues decreased $0.4 million, or 31%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was related to reductions in product and service revenues at Exemplar.\n\nNet loss was $24.0 million, or $(0.09) per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $19.8 million, or $(0.08) per basic and diluted share, in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**First Nine months 2024 Financial Results Compared to Prior Year Period**\n\nSG&A expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 1%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a result of the Company's increased focus on PRGN-2012, commercial readiness costs increased versus the prior year period. In addition, the second and third quarter of 2024 included higher severance costs associated with the suspension of ActoBio's operations and the 2024 Precigen workforce reduction. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation and insurance expenses due to decreasing rates in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased $5.7 million, or 16%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the Company's increased focus on PRGN-2012. There were $4.4 million of increased costs associated with PRGN-2012 in advance of the Company's planned BLA submission, including the start of the PRGN-2012 confirmatory clinical trial and close out of the PRGN-2012 pivotal clinical trial activities and professional fees incurred related to the Company's manufacturing facility. Additionally, personnel costs increased by $3.0 million due to an increase in the hiring of employees related to the advancement of PRGN-2012 in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and severance charges incurred related to the Precigen workforce reduction in the third quarter of 2024. These increases were offset by lower costs incurred at contract research organizations for other programs compared to the prior year period as well as a reduction in total ActoBio operating expenses compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nOther income (expense), net, decreased $4.3 million, or 166%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of cumulative translation losses of $2.9 million resulting from the final closing of the ActoBio facilities in the third quarter of 2024, as well as a reduction in net interest income compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nIn conjunction with the suspension of ActoBio's operations, the Company recorded $34.5 million of impairment charges related to goodwill and long-lived assets in the second quarter of 2024, as well as a related tax benefit of $1.7 million.\n\nTotal revenues decreased $2.3 million, or 45%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was related to reductions in product and service revenues at Exemplar.\n\nNet loss was $106.5 million, or $(0.41) per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $62.8 million, or $(0.26) per basic and diluted share, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Precigen : Advancing Medicine with Precision****®** Precigen (Nasdaq: PGEN) is a dedicated discovery and clinical stage biopharmaceutical company advancing the next generation of gene and cell therapies using precision technology to target the most urgent and intractable diseases in our core therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.
