(“Arhaus” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ARHS), a rapidly growing lifestyle brand and omni-channel retailer of premium artisan-crafted home furnishings, today reported third quarter 2024 results for the period ended September 30, 2024. Highlights include:\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024_**\n\n  * Net revenue of $319 million\n  * Comparable growth(1) of (9.2)%\n  * Net and comprehensive income of $10 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $23 million\n\n\n\n**_Year-to-Date 2024, through September 30_**\n\n  * Net revenue of $924 million\n  * Comparable growth of (8.6)%\n  * Net and comprehensive income of $47 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $92 million\n\n\n\n**_2024 Outlook (Updated)_**\n\n  * Net revenue of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion\n  * Comparable growth of (12.0)% to (11.0)%\n  * Net and comprehensive income of $55 million to $60 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(5) of $115 million to $125 million\n\n\n\n**John Reed, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, said** , “Our third-quarter results demonstrate our team’s commitment to operational excellence in a challenging environment. We remain focused on our long-term growth strategy grounded in our premium, livable luxury offerings and exceptional client experience. With ten new showrooms opened already this year and an eleventh opening tomorrow in Corte Madera, California, we remain committed to expanding our presence in key markets.\n\n“While demand trends improved throughout the third quarter, we’re adjusting our full-year sales and earnings outlook to reflect a continued tempered consumer environment, which we believe is temporary given our innovative product offerings and compelling marketing campaigns. Despite near term headwinds, our strong, debt-free balance sheet enables us to continue prudent investment in strategic priorities.\n\n“Our long-term success is driven by our teams’ dedication to delivering the best products and an inspiring showroom experience. I want to thank each of them for their ongoing commitment, which highlights the resilience of our growth strategy and our commitment to creating value for our shareholders.”\n\n**_Results and Highlights_**\n\nNet revenue in the third quarter was $319 million, compared to $326 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily related to the non-recurrence of prior year abnormal backlog deliveries and lower total demand.\n\nComparable growth(1) was (9.2)% and demand comparable growth(2) was (11.3)% in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nGross margin was $123 million, compared to $131 million in the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by lower net revenue and higher Showroom costs as we continue to expand our footprint.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $112 million, compared to $107 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by legal costs, marketing investments, and strategic investments to support and drive the growth of the business, including supply chain and technology improvements. This was partially offset by the non-recurrence of last year’s donation to The Nature Conservancy.\n\nNet and comprehensive income was $10 million compared to $20 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $23 million compared to $34 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of net revenue was 7.2% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 10.3% in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**_Balance Sheet and Liquidity_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company reported the following:\n\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $178 million, and the Company had no long-term debt at September 30, 2024. Net merchandise inventory increased $41 million to $295 million, compared to $254 million as of December 31, 2023. Client deposits increased $50 million to $224 million, compared to $174 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $115 million, compared to $148 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was approximately $89 million. Company-funded capital expenditures(3) were approximately $62 million, and landlord contributions were approximately $27 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was approximately $59 million. Company-funded capital expenditures were approximately $47 million, and landlord contributions were approximately $12 million.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $72 million primarily due to the payment of the special dividend on our Class A and Class B common stock. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $2 million primarily due to the repurchase of shares for payment of withholding taxes for equity based compensation.\n\nThe Company ended the third quarter with 101 total Showrooms across 29 states.\n\n**_2024 Outlook_**\n\nThe table below presents our updated expectations for selected full year 2024 financial operating results and sets out our expectations for selected fourth quarter 2024 operating results.\n\n**_Full Year_**| ** _Current Guidance_**| ** _Previous Guidance_**| ** _Q4 Guidance_**  \n---|---|---|---  \nNet revenue| $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion| $1.25 billion to $1.29 billion| $306 million to $326 million  \nComparable growth(1)| (12)% to (11)%| (11)% to (8)%| (22)% to (16)%  \nNet income (4)| $55 million to $60 million| $55 million to $75 million| $8 million to $13 million  \nAdjusted EBITDA(5)| $115 million to $125 million| $125 million to $145 million| $23 million to $33 million  \n**Other estimates:**  \nCompany-funded capital expenditures(3)| ~$80 million| $80 million to $100 million  \nDepreciation & amortization| ~$40 million| $40 million to $45 million  \nFully diluted shares| Unchanged| ~ $141 million  \nEffective tax rate| Unchanged| ~ 26%  \n  \n(1) **Comparable growth** is a key performance indicator and is defined as the year-over-year percentage change of the dollar value of orders delivered (based on purchase price), net of the dollar value of returns (based on amount credited to client), from our comparable Showrooms and eCommerce, including through our catalogs and other mailings.(2) **Demand comparable growth** is a key performance indicator and is defined as the year-over-year percentage change of demand from our comparable Showrooms and eCommerce, including through our catalogs and other mailings.(3) **Company-funded capital expenditures** is defined as total net cash used in investing activities less landlord contributions.(4) U.S. GAAP net income (loss).(5) We have not reconciled guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to the corresponding GAAP financial measure because we do not provide guidance for the various reconciling items. These items include, but are not limited to, future share-based compensation expense, income taxes, interest income, and transaction costs. We are unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because we cannot determine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted due to the fact that these items could vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measure is not available without unreasonable effort.\n\n**_Conference Call_**\n\nYou are invited to listen to Arhaus’ conference call to discuss the third quarter 2024 financial results scheduled for today, November 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe that providing these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to our investors as they present an informative supplemental view of our results from period to period by removing the effect of non-recurring items. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which we have made adjustments are unusual or infrequent or will not recur. These non-U.S. GAAP measures are not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. These measures should only be read together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures. Please refer to the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, below.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\nCertain statements contained herein, including statements under the headings “2024 Outlook (Updated)” and “2024 Outlook”, are not based on historical fact and are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of applicable securities laws.\n\nForward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including, but not limited to, “may,” “could,” “seek,” “guidance,” “predict,” “potential,” “likely,” “believe,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “forecast,” or variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions.
