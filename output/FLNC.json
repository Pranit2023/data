The replay will be available on the Company’s website at http://fluenceenergy.com by selecting Investors, News & Events, and Events & Presentations.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe present our operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). We believe certain financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, and Free Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP measures, provide users of our financial statements with supplemental information that may be useful in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that such non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our operating results presented under GAAP, can be used to better assess our performance from period to period and relative to performance of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure. Such non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, including that other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently, reducing their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated from the consolidated statements of operations using net income (loss) adjusted for (i) interest income, net, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, and (v) other non-recurring income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA also includes amounts impacting net income related to estimated payments due to related parties pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, dated October 27, 2021, by and among Fluence Energy, Inc., Fluence Energy, LLC, Siemens Industry, Inc. and AES Grid Stability, LLC (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”).\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit is calculated using gross profit, adjusted to exclude (i) stock-based compensation expenses, (ii) amortization, and (iii) other non-recurring income or expenses. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is calculated using Adjusted Gross Profit divided by total revenue.\n\nFree Cash Flow is calculated from the consolidated statements of cash flows and is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less purchase of property and equipment made in the period. We expect our Free Cash Flow to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to support our plans for growth. Limitations on the use of Free Cash Flow include (i) it should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures (for example, cash is still required to satisfy other working capital needs, including short-term investment policy, restricted cash, and intangible assets); (ii) Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities; and (iii) this metric does not reflect our future contractual commitments.\n\nPlease refer to the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release and the accompanying tables contained at the end of this release.\n\nThe Company is not able to provide a quantitative reconciliation of full fiscal year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income (Loss) on a forward-looking basis within this press release because of the uncertainty around certain items that may impact Adjusted EBITDA, including stock compensation and restructuring expenses, that are not within our control or cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort.\n\n**About Fluence**\n\nFluence Energy, Inc.

KEY OPERATING METRICS (UNAUDITED)**  \n---  \n  \nThe following tables present our key operating metrics for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The tables below present the metrics in either Gigawatts (GW) or Gigawatt hours (GWh). Our key operating metrics focus on project milestones to measure our performance and designate each project as either “deployed”, “assets under management”, “contracted backlog”, or “pipeline”.\n\n**Fiscal Year Ended September 30,**| **​**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **​**| **Change**| **Change %**  \n**Energy Storage Products**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDeployed (GW)| 5.0| ​| 3.0| ​| 2.0| ​| 66.7| %  \nDeployed (GWh)| 12.8| 7.2| 5.6| 77.8| %  \nContracted backlog (GW)| 7.5| ​| 4.6| ​| 2.9| ​| 63.0| %  \nPipeline (GW)| 25.8| 12.2| 13.6| 111.5| %  \nPipeline (GWh)| 80.5| ​| 34.2| ​| 46.3| ​| 135.4| %  \n  \n**Fiscal Year Ended September 30,**| **​**  \n---|---  \n _(amounts in GW)_| **2024**| **2023**| **​**| **Change**| **Change %**  \n**Service Contracts**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAssets under management| 4.3| ​| 2.8| ​| 1.5| ​| 53.6| %  \nContracted backlog| 4.1| ​| 2.9| ​| 1.2| ​| 41.4| %  \nPipeline| 25.6| ​| 13.7| ​| 11.9| ​| 86.9| %  \n  \n**Fiscal Year Ended September 30,**| **​**  \n---|---  \n _(amounts in GW)_| **2024**| **2023**| **​**| **Change**| **Change %**  \n**Digital Contracts**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAssets under management| 18.3| ​| 15.5| ​| 2.8| ​| 18.1| %  \nContracted backlog| 10.6| ​| 6.8| ​| 3.8| ​| 55.9| %  \nPipeline| 64.5| 24.4| 40.1| 164.3| %  \n  \nThe following table presents our order intake for the three months and fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The table is presented in Gigawatts (GW): \n\n**Three Months Ended September**| **Fiscal Year Ended September**  \n---|---  \n _(amounts in GW)_| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **Change %**| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **Change %**  \n**Energy Storage Products**  \nContracted| 1.4| 0.6| 0.8| 133| %| 5.2| 2.2| 3.0| 136.4| %  \n**Service Contracts**  \nContracted| 1.0| 0.6| 0.4| 67| %| 3.0| 1.8| 1.2| 66.7| %  \n**Digital Contracts**  \nContracted| 4.5| 1.8| 2.7| 150| %| 8.6| 6.2| 2.4| 38.7| %  \n  \n**_Deployed_**\n\nDeployed represents cumulative energy storage products and solutions that have achieved substantial completion and are not decommissioned. Deployed is monitored by management to measure our performance towards achieving project milestones.\n\n**_Assets Under Management_**\n\nAssets under management for service contracts represents our long-term service contracts with customers associated with our completed energy storage system products and solutions. We start providing maintenance, monitoring, or other operational services after the storage product projects are completed. In some cases, services may be commenced for energy storage solutions prior to achievement of substantial completion. This is not limited to energy storage solutions delivered by Fluence. Assets under management for digital software represents contracts signed and active (post go live). Assets under management serves as an indicator of expected revenue from our customers and assists management in forecasting our expected financial performance.\n\n**_Contracted Backlog_**\n\nFor our energy storage products and solutions contracts, contracted backlog includes signed customer orders or contracts under execution prior to when substantial completion is achieved. For service contracts, contracted backlog includes signed service agreements associated with our storage product projects that have not been completed and the associated service has not started. For digital applications contracts, contracted backlog includes signed agreements where the associated subscription has not started.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that our contracted backlog will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period or at all. Contracted backlog may not generate margins equal to our historical operating results. We have only recently begun to track our contracted backlog on a consistent basis as performance measures, and as a result, we do not have significant experience in determining the level of realization that we will achieve on these contracts. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our control. If our contracted backlog fails to result in revenue as anticipated or in a timely manner, we could experience a reduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity.\n\n**_Contracted/Order Intake_**\n\nContracted, which we use interchangeably with “order intake”, represents new energy storage product and solutions contracts, new service contracts and new digital contracts signed during each period presented. We define “Contracted” as a firm and binding purchase order, letter of award, change order or other signed contract (in each case an “Order”) from the customer that is received and accepted by Fluence. Our order intake is intended to convey the dollar amount and gigawatts (operating measure) contracted in the period presented. We believe that order intake provides useful information to investors and management because the order intake provides visibility into future revenue and enables evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s sales activity and the attractiveness of its offerings in the market.\n\n**_Pipeline_**\n\nPipeline represents our uncontracted, potential revenue from energy storage products and solutions, service, and digital software contracts, which have a reasonable likelihood of contract execution within 24 months. Pipeline is an internal management metric that we construct from market information reported by our global sales force. Pipeline is monitored by management to understand the anticipated growth of our Company and our estimated future revenue related to customer contracts for our battery-based energy storage products and solutions, services and digital software.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that our pipeline will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period or at all. Pipeline may not generate margins equal to our historical operating results. We have only recently begun to track our pipeline on a consistent basis as performance measures, and as a result, we do not have significant experience in determining the level of realization that we will achieve on these contracts. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our control. If our pipeline fails to result in revenue as anticipated or in a timely manner, we could experience a reduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity.\n\n**_Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)_**\n\nARR represents the net annualized contracted value including software subscriptions including initial trial, licensing, long term service agreements, and extended warranty agreements as of the reporting period. ARR excludes one-time fees, revenue share or other revenue that is non-recurring and variable. The Company believes ARR is an important operating metric as it provides visibility to future revenue. It is important to management to increase this visibility as we continue to expand. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to replace these items.\n\n**FLUENCE ENERGY, INC.****RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES (UNAUDITED)**  \n---  \n  \nThe following tables present our non-GAAP measures for the periods indicated.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **​**| **​**| **Change**| **Fiscal Year Ended September 30,**| **​**| **​**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n _($ in thousands)_| **2024**| **​**| **2023**| **​**| **Change**| **%**| **2024**| **​**| **2023**| **​**| **Change**| **%**  \nNet income (loss)| $| 67,724| $| 4,817| ​| $| 62,907| ​| 1306| %| $| 30,367| $| (104,818| )| $| 135,185| 129| %  \nAdd (deduct):  \nInterest income, net| (1,122| )| ​| (1,137| )| ​| 15| ​| (1| )%| (5,676| )| (5,388| )| (288| )| 5| %  \nIncome tax expense| 7,878| ​| 6,607| ​| 1,271| ​| 19| %| 9,206| 4,549| 4,657| 102| %  \nDepreciation and amortization| 4,088| ​| 2,814| ​| 1,274| ​| 45| %| 14,482| 10,665| 3,817| 36| %  \nStock-based compensation _(a)_|  5,469| 5,503| (34| )| ​| (1| )%| 23,875| 26,920| (3,045| )| (11| )%  \nOther non-recurring expenses _(b)_|  2,835| ​| 1,245| ​| 1,590| ​| 128| %| 5,852| 6,684| (832| )| (12| )%  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  $| 86,872| $| 19,849| $| 67,023| ​| 338| %| $| 78,106| $| (61,388| )| $| 139,494| ​| 227| %  \n(a) Includes incentive awards that will be settled in shares and incentive awards that will be settled in cash.

Reports Record Performance in 2024 and Initiates 2025 Guidance\n\nNovember 25, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/9596/pdf)\n\nARLINGTON, Va., Nov. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fluence Energy, Inc. (Nasdaq: FLNC) (“Fluence” or the “Company”), a global market leader delivering intelligent energy storage, operational services, and asset optimization software, today announced its results for the three months and full fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Record revenue for fiscal year 2024 of approximately $2.7 billion and revenue for the fourth quarter of approximately $1.2 billion, representing an increase of approximately 22% from fiscal year 2023 and an increase of approximately 82% from the same quarter last year, respectively.\n  * GAAP gross profit margin improved to approximately 12.6% and 12.8% for fiscal year 2024 and the fourth quarter, respectively, compared to approximately 6.4% and 11.3% for fiscal year 2023 and the same quarter last year, respectively, reflecting the Company's continued focus on ongoing profit improvement strategies.\n  * Net income of approximately $30.4 million and $67.7 million for fiscal year 2024 and the fourth quarter, respectively, improved from a net loss of approximately $104.8 million and net income of approximately $4.8 million, for fiscal year 2023 and the same quarter last year, respectively.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 of approximately $78.1 million and $86.9 million for fiscal year 2024 and the fourth quarter, respectively, improved from approximately negative $61.4 million and $19.8 million for fiscal year 2023 and the same quarter last year, respectively.\n  * Quarterly order intake of approximately $1.2 billion, compared to approximately $737 million for the same quarter last year.\n  * Backlog2 increased to approximately $4.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to approximately $2.9 billion as of September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Financial Position**\n\n  * Total Cash3 of approximately $518.7 million as of September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately $56.0 million from September 30, 2023.\n  * Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $79.7 million, compared to approximately negative $111.9 million for fiscal year 2023.\n  * Free cash flow1 was approximately $71.6 million, compared to approximately negative $114.9 million for fiscal year 2023.\n\n\n\n**Fiscal Year 2025 Outlook**\n\nThe Company is initiating fiscal year 2025 guidance as follows:\n\n  * Revenue of approximately $3.6 billion to $4.4 billion with a midpoint of $4.0 billion.

The replay will be available on the Company’s website at http://fluenceenergy.com by selecting Investors, News & Events, and Events & Presentations.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe present our operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). We believe certain financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, and Free Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP measures, provide users of our financial statements with supplemental information that may be useful in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that such non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our operating results presented under GAAP, can be used to better assess our performance from period to period and relative to performance of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure. Such non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, including that other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently, reducing their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated from the consolidated statements of operations using net income (loss) adjusted for (i) interest income, net, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, and (v) other non-recurring income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA also includes amounts impacting net income related to estimated payments due to related parties pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, dated October 27, 2021, by and among Fluence Energy, Inc., Fluence Energy, LLC, Siemens Industry, Inc. and AES Grid Stability, LLC (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”).\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit is calculated using gross profit, adjusted to exclude (i) stock-based compensation expenses, (ii) amortization, and (iii) other non-recurring income or expenses. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is calculated using Adjusted Gross Profit divided by total revenue.\n\nFree Cash Flow is calculated from the consolidated statements of cash flows and is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less purchase of property and equipment made in the period. We expect our Free Cash Flow to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to support our plans for growth. Limitations on the use of Free Cash Flow include (i) it should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures (for example, cash is still required to satisfy other working capital needs, including short-term investment policy, restricted cash, and intangible assets); (ii) Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities; and (iii) this metric does not reflect our future contractual commitments.\n\nPlease refer to the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release and the accompanying tables contained at the end of this release.\n\nThe Company is not able to provide a quantitative reconciliation of full fiscal year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income (Loss) on a forward-looking basis within this press release because of the uncertainty around certain items that may impact Adjusted EBITDA, including stock compensation and restructuring expenses, that are not within our control or cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort.\n\n**About Fluence**\n\nFluence Energy, Inc.

KEY OPERATING METRICS (UNAUDITED)**  \n---  \n  \nThe following tables present our key operating metrics for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The tables below present the metrics in either Gigawatts (GW) or Gigawatt hours (GWh). Our key operating metrics focus on project milestones to measure our performance and designate each project as either “deployed”, “assets under management”, “contracted backlog”, or “pipeline”.\n\n**Fiscal Year Ended September 30,**| **​**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **​**| **Change**| **Change %**  \n**Energy Storage Products**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDeployed (GW)| 5.0| ​| 3.0| ​| 2.0| ​| 66.7| %  \nDeployed (GWh)| 12.8| 7.2| 5.6| 77.8| %  \nContracted backlog (GW)| 7.5| ​| 4.6| ​| 2.9| ​| 63.0| %  \nPipeline (GW)| 25.8| 12.2| 13.6| 111.5| %  \nPipeline (GWh)| 80.5| ​| 34.2| ​| 46.3| ​| 135.4| %  \n  \n**Fiscal Year Ended September 30,**| **​**  \n---|---  \n _(amounts in GW)_| **2024**| **2023**| **​**| **Change**| **Change %**  \n**Service Contracts**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAssets under management| 4.3| ​| 2.8| ​| 1.5| ​| 53.6| %  \nContracted backlog| 4.1| ​| 2.9| ​| 1.2| ​| 41.4| %  \nPipeline| 25.6| ​| 13.7| ​| 11.9| ​| 86.9| %  \n  \n**Fiscal Year Ended September 30,**| **​**  \n---|---  \n _(amounts in GW)_| **2024**| **2023**| **​**| **Change**| **Change %**  \n**Digital Contracts**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAssets under management| 18.3| ​| 15.5| ​| 2.8| ​| 18.1| %  \nContracted backlog| 10.6| ​| 6.8| ​| 3.8| ​| 55.9| %  \nPipeline| 64.5| 24.4| 40.1| 164.3| %  \n  \nThe following table presents our order intake for the three months and fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The table is presented in Gigawatts (GW): \n\n**Three Months Ended September**| **Fiscal Year Ended September**  \n---|---  \n _(amounts in GW)_| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **Change %**| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **Change %**  \n**Energy Storage Products**  \nContracted| 1.4| 0.6| 0.8| 133| %| 5.2| 2.2| 3.0| 136.4| %  \n**Service Contracts**  \nContracted| 1.0| 0.6| 0.4| 67| %| 3.0| 1.8| 1.2| 66.7| %  \n**Digital Contracts**  \nContracted| 4.5| 1.8| 2.7| 150| %| 8.6| 6.2| 2.4| 38.7| %  \n  \n**_Deployed_**\n\nDeployed represents cumulative energy storage products and solutions that have achieved substantial completion and are not decommissioned. Deployed is monitored by management to measure our performance towards achieving project milestones.\n\n**_Assets Under Management_**\n\nAssets under management for service contracts represents our long-term service contracts with customers associated with our completed energy storage system products and solutions. We start providing maintenance, monitoring, or other operational services after the storage product projects are completed. In some cases, services may be commenced for energy storage solutions prior to achievement of substantial completion. This is not limited to energy storage solutions delivered by Fluence. Assets under management for digital software represents contracts signed and active (post go live). Assets under management serves as an indicator of expected revenue from our customers and assists management in forecasting our expected financial performance.\n\n**_Contracted Backlog_**\n\nFor our energy storage products and solutions contracts, contracted backlog includes signed customer orders or contracts under execution prior to when substantial completion is achieved. For service contracts, contracted backlog includes signed service agreements associated with our storage product projects that have not been completed and the associated service has not started. For digital applications contracts, contracted backlog includes signed agreements where the associated subscription has not started.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that our contracted backlog will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period or at all. Contracted backlog may not generate margins equal to our historical operating results. We have only recently begun to track our contracted backlog on a consistent basis as performance measures, and as a result, we do not have significant experience in determining the level of realization that we will achieve on these contracts. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our control. If our contracted backlog fails to result in revenue as anticipated or in a timely manner, we could experience a reduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity.\n\n**_Contracted/Order Intake_**\n\nContracted, which we use interchangeably with “order intake”, represents new energy storage product and solutions contracts, new service contracts and new digital contracts signed during each period presented. We define “Contracted” as a firm and binding purchase order, letter of award, change order or other signed contract (in each case an “Order”) from the customer that is received and accepted by Fluence. Our order intake is intended to convey the dollar amount and gigawatts (operating measure) contracted in the period presented. We believe that order intake provides useful information to investors and management because the order intake provides visibility into future revenue and enables evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s sales activity and the attractiveness of its offerings in the market.\n\n**_Pipeline_**\n\nPipeline represents our uncontracted, potential revenue from energy storage products and solutions, service, and digital software contracts, which have a reasonable likelihood of contract execution within 24 months. Pipeline is an internal management metric that we construct from market information reported by our global sales force. Pipeline is monitored by management to understand the anticipated growth of our Company and our estimated future revenue related to customer contracts for our battery-based energy storage products and solutions, services and digital software.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that our pipeline will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period or at all. Pipeline may not generate margins equal to our historical operating results. We have only recently begun to track our pipeline on a consistent basis as performance measures, and as a result, we do not have significant experience in determining the level of realization that we will achieve on these contracts. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our control. If our pipeline fails to result in revenue as anticipated or in a timely manner, we could experience a reduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity.\n\n**_Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)_**\n\nARR represents the net annualized contracted value including software subscriptions including initial trial, licensing, long term service agreements, and extended warranty agreements as of the reporting period. ARR excludes one-time fees, revenue share or other revenue that is non-recurring and variable. The Company believes ARR is an important operating metric as it provides visibility to future revenue. It is important to management to increase this visibility as we continue to expand. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to replace these items.\n\n**FLUENCE ENERGY, INC.****RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES (UNAUDITED)**  \n---  \n  \nThe following tables present our non-GAAP measures for the periods indicated.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **​**| **​**| **Change**| **Fiscal Year Ended September 30,**| **​**| **​**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n _($ in thousands)_| **2024**| **​**| **2023**| **​**| **Change**| **%**| **2024**| **​**| **2023**| **​**| **Change**| **%**  \nNet income (loss)| $| 67,724| $| 4,817| ​| $| 62,907| ​| 1306| %| $| 30,367| $| (104,818| )| $| 135,185| 129| %  \nAdd (deduct):  \nInterest income, net| (1,122| )| ​| (1,137| )| ​| 15| ​| (1| )%| (5,676| )| (5,388| )| (288| )| 5| %  \nIncome tax expense| 7,878| ​| 6,607| ​| 1,271| ​| 19| %| 9,206| 4,549| 4,657| 102| %  \nDepreciation and amortization| 4,088| ​| 2,814| ​| 1,274| ​| 45| %| 14,482| 10,665| 3,817| 36| %  \nStock-based compensation _(a)_|  5,469| 5,503| (34| )| ​| (1| )%| 23,875| 26,920| (3,045| )| (11| )%  \nOther non-recurring expenses _(b)_|  2,835| ​| 1,245| ​| 1,590| ​| 128| %| 5,852| 6,684| (832| )| (12| )%  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  $| 86,872| $| 19,849| $| 67,023| ​| 338| %| $| 78,106| $| (61,388| )| $| 139,494| ​| 227| %  \n(a) Includes incentive awards that will be settled in shares and incentive awards that will be settled in cash.
