Business**\n\n**Overview**\n\nPhoenix Motor Inc., doing business as “Phoenix Motorcars” through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Phoenix Cars LLC, Phoenix Motorcars Leasing LLC, and EdisonFuture Motor, Inc., is a leading electrification solutions provider for the commercial vehicle industry as well as other industries. Phoenix designs, develops, manufactures, assembles, and integrates electric drive systems and light and medium duty electric vehicles (“EVs”), with an aim to reduce carbon intensity and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The Company operates two primary brands, “Phoenix Motorcars” which is focused on commercial products including medium duty electric vehicles, chargers and electric forklifts, and “EdisonFuture” which intends to offer light-duty electric vehicles.\n\nAs an EV pioneer, we launched our first medium-duty electric drivetrain in 2009 and delivered our first commercial EV in 2014. In 2019, we launched our second generation (“Gen 2”) High Power Drive System for the Ford E450 chassis, the E-200. Since April 2021, we have been in production of our third generation (“Gen 3”) drivetrain (E-300). We are currently scheduled to release our fourth generation (“Gen 4”) drivetrain in mid-2024, which is expected to allow for substantially higher production volumes and achieve significant cost reduction.\n\nOver the last six years we have developed and deployed for our customers all-electric shuttle buses, utility trucks, service trucks, cargo trucks and flatbed trucks. This differentiates us in the market where most commercial EV manufacturers are still in the prototype phase. As of December 31, 2023, we have delivered a total of 134 EVs to more than 46 customers, representing what we believe is the largest number of Class 4 cutaway medium duty electric shuttle bus deployments in the U.S. and the most electric vehicles deployed on the Ford E-Series chassis. With over four million zero-emission miles accumulatively driven by the vehicles we delivered, we have gained significant industry experience, distinct expertise and extensive knowledge in R&D, production, commercialization, customer engagement and validation of light and medium duty EVs, enabling us to drive continued design enhancements and innovations in our current and future generations drivetrain systems and other products. \n\n**Market Opportunity**\n\nThe commercial EV market, which we believe is currently underserved, is projected to grow from a low base today to global sales of three million units by 2025 and nine million by 2030, led by buses and light trucks, representing significant growth opportunities. Major factors driving the growth of the commercial EV market are rising policy support, increasing electrification of public transport fleets, stringent government regulations, advancements in battery pack technologies and electric powertrains and accelerated investment in charging infrastructure. By taking advantage of our proprietary technology, industry-leading experience and expertise, as well as increasing EV demand boosted by government incentives, grants and regulations, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the commercial market opportunities. \n\n**Products**\n\nWe sell our products both fully integrated into complete vehicles and in kit form to other business partners for integration into complete vehicles. We are currently in production of our Gen 3 drivetrain, which includes the largest battery pack and longest range for any Class 4 product on the market, offering up to 160 miles in range. We plan to start production of our Gen 4 vehicles before the third quarter of 2024, offering battery pack capacities of 90kWh and 150kWh with both “Buy America” and non “Buy America” options, allowing for flexibility in pricing and configuration primarily targeting the transit bus, school bus, airport shuttle, delivery truck and work truck segments. In particular, key features such as drivetrain design with batteries mounted within frame rails, energy efficient 750V architecture and fast, bi-directional charging will significantly improve vehicle safety and overall performance of our products.\n\n**Customers**\n\nThe wide range of our medium-duty fleet customers include utilities, cities, municipalities, transit agencies, airports, hotels, seaports, school districts, parking companies, universities, and corporate campuses, with the configurations varying from shuttle buses, Type A school buses, utility trucks, service trucks, to flatbed trucks, walk-in vans, and cargo trucks.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our backlog of approximately 79 orders are all vehicles. The order backlog represents $17.7 million of revenue.\n\n1\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nOn November 13, 2023, the Company entered into two Asset Purchase Agreements (collectively, the “Asset Purchase Agreements”) with Proterra, Inc. and its subsidiary, Proterra Operating Company, Inc. (collectively, “Proterra”), pursuant to which Phoenix agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets of the Proterra Transit business line. Pursuant to the separate Asset Purchase Agreements, Phoenix agreed to purchase:\n\n(i) the Proterra Transit Business Unit, which is the business unit of Proterra that designs, develops and sells electric transit buses as an original equipment manufacturer for North American public transit agencies, airports, universities and other commercial transit fleets (the “Proterra Transit Business Unit”), and\n\n(ii) the Proterra Battery Lease Agreements, which are all of the battery lease transferred contracts to which Proterra is a party as the “lessor” thereunder, used in connection with deployed Proterra electric transit buses (the “Proterra Battery Lease Agreements”).\n\nOn January 11, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of the Proterra Transit Business Unit for a purchase price of $3.5 million. The Company also assumed certain of Proterra’s obligations associated with the purchased Proterra Transit Business Unit, free and clear of liens, claims, encumbrances, other than certain specified cure payments and other liabilities of Proterra related to the Proterra Transit Business Unit. On February 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of the Proterra Battery Lease Agreements for a purchase price of $6.5 million.\n\n**Our Strategies**\n\nIn addressing the market opportunities, we are to:\n\n●| Pursue an asset light strategy. We’ve been actively building and expanding strategic partnerships and alliance in R&D, engineering and supply chain to accelerate the development and production of our solutions. Tapping into and leveraging the existing capabilities and infrastructure that our strategic partners have built, we are able to bring our solutions to market more quickly and cost efficiently, without the need to invest substantial amounts of capital. In addition, we are currently designing and executing a plan to utilize customer and third-party assembly facilities to boost production capacity with low capital requirements.  \n---|---  \n●| Achieve scale. By standardizing and modularizing production and optimizing operations, we have a clear path to achieving significant scale in a cost-effective manner for our Gen 4 products and onward. The ongoing reconfiguration of our Anaheim facility is to not only ramp up production, but also to serve as a training and showcase facility to ensure procedures are standardized across our entire production network.  \n---|---  \n●| Secure supply of key components for production. Benefiting from strong supply chain partnerships such as the one recently announced with CATL, the largest battery supplier in the world for the EV industry in terms of volume, for long term strategic supply of K-Pack batteries and related products, we’re addressing the challenges and constraints that have contributed to delivery delays in prior reporting periods.  \n---|---  \n●| Reduce costs. We’re shifting from a strategy of focus on low volume, high customization products to one that will allow us to scale quickly, based on a change of vehicle design and engineering, standardization and modularization of processes and procedures and the use of standardized components and sub-assemblies. As we ramp up and further optimize supply chains and improve processes, we expect to substantially lower production and material costs for Gen 4 vehicles compared to that for Gen 3 vehicles, transforming the fundamentals of the business towards sustainably higher profitability.  \n---|---  \n●| Capitalize on increasing regulatory and customer demands. We believe the commercial EV space is at a significant inflection point driven by multiple tailwinds including regulations, corporate environmental mandates and state and federal grants. The growing supply chain maturity is also significantly increasing the economic attractiveness of EVs when compared with internal combustion engine vehicles. We will continue to aggressively pursue the increasing demand for EV adoption.  \n---|---  \n●| Develop a purpose-built, ground-up chassis and EdisonFuture platform. The development of our fifth generation (“Gen 5”) product will enable Phoenix to be chassis independent, removing one of the major impediments facing our businesses. It’ll also reduce material and production costs and allow us to customize vehicle designs to meet specialized needs, while   \n---|---  \n  \n2\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nmaintaining standardized processes and procedures, increasing our capacity to accommodate customer requirements and meet the evolving needs of the electric vehicle market. Our EdisonFuture platform will benefit greatly from the development of prior generations, which will further lower costs and speed time-to-market.  \n---  \n  \n**Competition**\n\nCompetition in the light and medium-duty truck industry is intense, as new regulatory requirements for vehicle emissions, technological advances and shifting customer demands are pushing the industry towards zero-emission solutions.\n\nPhoenix competes with a number of commercial EV manufacturers, such as Lightning eMotors and Green Power Motor Company. Several major companies, including BYD, Ford, General Motors, Tesla and Daimler have begun entry into the commercial EV market. In addition, many of the aforementioned companies, along with others, such as Volvo, BYD, Hyundai, Honda, and Fiat participate in the hybrid combined electric and gasoline powered vehicle business, which includes commercial vehicles that may compete with Phoenix. Most of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do. They may be able to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing and support of their electric truck programs. Additionally, those competitors have greater name recognition, larger sales forces, broader customer and industry relationships and other resources than we do.\n\n**Our Competitive Strengths**\n\n●| Demonstrated capabilities to develop and deliver commercial EVs.  \n---|---  \n●| Well-rounded management team with many years of proven industry experience in taking vehicles from concept to mass production.  \n---|---  \n●| Long and deep relationships with OEMs, customers and dealerships.  \n---|---  \n●| Long and deep relationships with strategic partners in R&D and engineering.  \n---|---  \n●| Standardized and modularized approach to product design and optimized supply chain to ramp up production and support expansion quickly and in a cost-effective manner.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Sales and Marketing**\n\nWe sell our vehicles to fleet customers directly and through our strategic relationships with premier commercial vehicle companies, including Matthews Specialty Vehicles, a leading manufacturer of specialty trucks and Pegasus Bus Company, a leading manufacturer of Type A school buses.\n\n**Manufacturing and Production**\n\nWe currently carry out the production of our EV shuttle buses and trucks from a leased facility at 1500 Lakeview Loop, Anaheim, California (the “Anaheim Facility”). The Anaheim Facility is leased by us at a rent of $0.4 million per year and comprises 39,043 square feet of space consisting of 21,000 square feet of manufacturing floor and 18,043 square feet of office space. Our Anaheim Facility will allow us design, build and test prototype vehicles and components in-house. The lease on Anaheim Facility expires in March 2027. We currently carry out the production of our electric transit buses from a leased facility located at 1 Whitlee Ct, Greenville, South Carolina (the “Greenville Facility”). The Greenville Facility is leased by use at a rent of $1.3 million per year and the lease on Greenville Facility expires in June 2026.\n\n**Human Capital**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 30 full-time employees based primarily in the greater Anaheim, California area. A majority of our employees are engaged in manufacturing functions. Our targeted hires typically have significant experience working for well-respected original equipment manufacturers, automotive engineering firms and software companies. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.\n\n3\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Government Regulation**\n\nWe operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among others, water use; air emissions; use of recycled materials; energy sources; the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; the protection of the environment, natural resources and endangered species; and the remediation of environmental contamination. We have been required to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits, many of which are difficult and costly to obtain and could be subject to legal challenges. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial, and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations.\n\nEnvironmental standards applicable to Phoenix are established by the laws and regulations of the state and countries in which Phoenix operates, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial civil and criminal fines, penalties, and possibly orders to cease the violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works.\n\nIn some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses.\n\nVehicle Safety and Testing Regulation\n\nOur vehicles are subject to, and comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including applicable U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards (“FMVSS”). As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that the vehicles meet or are exempt from all applicable FMVSSs before a vehicle can be imported into or sold in the U.S.\n\nThere are numerous FMVSSs that apply to our vehicles. Examples of these requirements include:\n\n●| Electric Vehicle Safety — limitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention and avoidance of electric shock following specified crash tests;  \n---|---  \n●| Crash Tests for High-Voltage System Integrity — preventing electric shock from high voltage systems and fires that result from fuel spillage during and after motor vehicle crashes.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to the FMVSS rules, Phoenix designs our vehicles to meet the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which prescribes requirements for bus and truck fleet owners. These include standards for defrosting and defogging systems and speedometers, as well as safety features such as steps and handholds.\n\nWe are also required to comply with other NHTSA requirements and federal laws administered by NHTSA, including early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports, foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements.\n\nAltoona Testing\n\nUnder the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (“STURAA”), federal funding of acquisition of a new model bus is unavailable unless a bus of that model has been tested for safety, structural integrity, durability, performance, maintainability, noise and fuel economy. Testing is conducted at the Larson Transportation Institute’s Bus Research and Testing Center in Altoona, Pennsylvania established for that purpose.\n\nVehicles that are built to Buy America compliant standards and have passed Altoona testing are eligible for FTA funding of up to 80% of the capital cost of a transit vehicle. Failure to complete testing in this timeframe would materially adversely affect order fulfillment, as well as future sales, to customers and potential customers that require successful completion of the test program.\n\nEPA Emissions & Certificate of Conformity\n\nThe U.S. Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”), concerning emissions for our vehicles. A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and an Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that \n\n4\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nhave sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. CARB sets the California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles. There are currently four states which have adopted the California standard for heavy-duty vehicles.\n\nThe Greenhouse Gas Rule was incorporated into the Clean Air Act on August 9, 2011. Since our vehicles have zero-emissions, Phoenix is required to seek an EPA Certificate of Conformity for the Greenhouse Gas Rule, and a CARB Executive Order for the CARB Greenhouse Gas Rule. Phoenix received the CARB Executive Order for its range of all-electric shuttle buses, trucks and school buses in November 2021 and application for the Executive Order for the 2022 Model Year vehicles is in process.\n\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Credits — U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n\nIn connection with the delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles under the Greenhouse Gas Rule, Phoenix will earn tradable credits that under current laws and regulations can be sold. Under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule, each BEV earns a credit multiplier of 4.5 for use in the calculation of emission credits. Commercial vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure they meet the nitrogen oxide emission standard for each type of vehicle produced. This emission standard continues to lower the emission requirement over time, increasing the difficulty for conventional diesel vehicles to meet the standard. Until technology catches up for commercial vehicles, manufacturers of diesel trucks will need to purchase GHG credits to cover their emission deficit. The Greenhouse Gas Rule provides the opportunity for the sale of excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the regulation does not limit the number of battery-electric credits sold within the same commercial vehicle category.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Credits — California Air Resources Board\n\nCalifornia has a greenhouse gas emissions standard which follows very closely to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standard. The delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles in California under the Greenhouse Gas Rule will earn Phoenix tradable credits that can be sold. Under CARB greenhouse gas regulations, each BEV will also earn a credit multiplier of 4.5 for use in the calculation of emission credits. Commercial vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure they meet the nitrogen oxide emission standard for each type of vehicle produced. This emission standard continues to lower the emission requirement over time, increasing the difficulty for conventional diesel vehicles to meet the standard.\n\nUntil technology catches up for commercial vehicles, manufacturers of diesel buses and trucks will need to purchase GHG credits to cover their emission deficit. The California timeline for reaching very low GHG emissions is more aggressive than the EPA. Commercial vehicle manufacturers will look to cover their emission deficits first for California. The Greenhouse Gas Rule provides an opportunity for the sale of excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the regulation does not limit the number of battery-electric credits sold within the same commercial vehicle categories.\n\n​\n\n**ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS**\n\n**Risks Related to Our Financial Condition**\n\nOur results of operations have not resulted in profitability, and we may not be able to achieve profitability going forward.\n\nWe had accumulated deficit of $49.2 million as of December 31, 2023. We have incurred a net loss of $20.6 and $12.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this 10 - K report, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Our management is developing plans to alleviate the negative trends and conditions described above and there is no guarantee that such plans will be successfully implemented. Our business plan is focused on providing sustainable and cost - effective solutions to the commercial transportation sector but is still unproven. There is no assurance that even if we successfully implement our business plan, that we will be able to curtail our losses or ever achieve profitable operations.\n\n5\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe have yet to achieve positive cash flow and, given our projected funding needs, our ability to generate positive cash flow is uncertain.\n\nWe have had negative cash flow from operating activities of $3.7 million and $14.9 million for years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. We anticipate that we will continue to have negative cash flow from operating and investing activities through the remainder of 2024 as we expect to incur research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses and make capital expenditures in our efforts to increase sales and ramp up operations. Our business also will at times require significant amounts of working capital to support our growth. An inability to generate positive cash flow for the near term may adversely affect our ability to raise needed capital for our business on reasonable terms, diminish supplier or customer willingness to enter into transactions with us, and have other adverse effects that may decrease our long-term viability. There can be no assurance that we will achieve positive cash flow in the near future or at all.\n\nOur audited financial statements included a statement that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and a continuation of negative financial trends could result in our inability to continue as a going concern.\n\nOur audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 were prepared on the assumption that we would continue as a going concern. As a result of the continuing operating costs as we develop of our EV trucks and Gen 4 as described above, our management has determined that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent auditor have included a “going concern” explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. The reaction of investors to the inclusion of a going concern statement by our independent auditor, and our potential inability to continue as a going concern, could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\n\nAdditionally, if our operating results fail to improve, then our financial condition could render us unable to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe Convertible Notes entered into in 2023 contain covenants that have and may in the future restrict our business and financing activities If we are not able to comply with our covenants under the Convertible Notes, we may be in default under the Convertible Notes which may have an immediate adverse effect on our business.\n\nThe Convertible Notes restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\n●| dispose of or sell our assets;  \n---|---  \n●| make material changes in our business or management, or accounting and reporting practices;  \n---|---  \n●| acquire, consolidate, or merge with other entities;  \n---|---  \n●| incur additional indebtedness;  \n---|---  \n●| create liens on our assets;  \n---|---  \n●| pay dividends;  \n---|---  \n●| make investments;  \n---|---  \n●| enter transactions with affiliates; and  \n---|---  \n●| pre-pay other indebtedness.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe covenants in the Convertible Notes, and any future financing agreements that we may enter, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in, expand or otherwise pursue our business activities and strategies. Further, if we fail to comply with our debt covenants in the future, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any future waivers under the Convertible Notes.\n\nIf the Convertible Notes were to become immediately due and payable because of such events of default, we may not have sufficient cash available to repay our obligations under the Convertible Notes and meet the working capital needs of our business, which would have an immediate adverse effect on our business and operating results. We would need to take further action to raise additional funds in the capital markets or otherwise to service our obligations under the Convertible Notes in addition to our other obligations over the period. If we do not have sufficient funds or we are unable to arrange for additional financing to repay outstanding debt, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and/or seek protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment.\n\n6\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of our electric vehicles.\n\nThe design, manufacture and sale of electric vehicles is a capital-intensive business. Our business plan to design, produce, sell and service commercial electric buses, vans and trucks, including the Gen 4, Gen 5, EF-1 truck and EF-1 V van, and Transit Buses is expected to require continued capital investment and incur substantial costs including research and development expenses, raw material procurement costs, sales and distribution expenses as we build our brand and market our vehicles, and general and administrative expenses as we scale our operations, identify and commit resources to investigate new areas of demand and incur costs as a public company. Our ability to become profitable in the future will not only depend on our ability to complete the design and development of our vehicles but also to control our capital expenditures and costs. As we expand our product portfolio, including the release of Gen 4 and the acquisition of the Proterra Transit Bus business in 2024, we will need to manage costs effectively to sell those products at our expected margins. If we are unable to cost efficiently design, manufacture, market, sell and distribute and service our vehicles and provide our services, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. Unlike established EV automotive manufacturers that have greater financial resources than we do, there can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital we need on favorable terms when required or at all. In addition, future debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions.\n\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our EV products, restrict our operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, stock price and our relationships with third parties with whom we have business relationships, at least until additional funding is obtained. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that would likely result in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment in us. In addition, our ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. \n\n**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**\n\nWe may experience delays in launching and ramping up production or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs.\n\n​\n\nWe have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp-up delays. In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products including enhancements under development relating to production assembly efficiency, material component availability, cost reduction and customer feedback. There is no guarantee we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features. We have limited experience to date in manufacturing electric vehicles at low volumes. To be successful, we will need to implement, maintain, and ramp-up efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains, high quality and output rates planned at our Anaheim manufacturing facility. We also need to hire, train, and compensate skilled employees for operations. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our vehicle production ramp-ups or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets. Any delay or other complication in ramping up the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp-ups of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nThe automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry.\n\nBoth the automobile industry generally, and the EV segment in particular, are highly competitive, and we will be competing for customers and sales with both EV manufacturers and traditional automotive companies. Most of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, or other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products than we may devote to our products. We expect competition for EVs to intensify due to increased demand and a regulatory push for alternative fuel vehicles. In addition, as fleet operators begin transitioning to EVs on a mass scale, we expect that more well-financed competitors will enter the commercial fleet EV market. Further, as a result of new entrants in the commercial fleet EV market, we may experience increased competition for components and other parts of our vehicles, which may have limited or single-source supply.\n\nIf we are unable to successfully design, develop, manufacture and sell our Gen 4, Gen 5, EF-1 truck and EF-1 V van, and our Transit Buses, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. If \n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nwe are able to manufacture and market the Gen 4, Gen 5, EF-1 truck and EF-1 V van, and Transit Buses, factors affecting competition include product performance and quality, technological innovation, customer experience, brand differentiation, product design, pricing and TCO, and manufacturing scale and efficiency. Increased competition will lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\n\nPhoenix faces competition from global automotive manufacturers.\n\nWe compete with a number of commercial EV manufacturers, including those such as Lightning eMotors and GreenPower Motor Company. In addition to Tesla & Rivian, a number of traditional global automobile manufacturers, including Ford, General Motors, Mercedes Benz, and Nissan-Renault- Mitsubishi-Toyota, and Chinese based EV manufacturers have entered the consumer EV business, and a few, including BYD, Ford, General Motors, Tesla and Daimler have begun entry into the commercial EV market. These companies have far greater resources, brand recognition, and distribution channels than Phoenix or the Company does, which could make it difficult for Phoenix to gain widespread market acceptance. There can be no assurance that Phoenix will be able to compete successfully with other market participants, and, if Phoenix cannot, then its business could fail.\n\nCosts of electric vehicles are high in comparison with those of traditional vehicles powered by internal combustion engines or hybrids.\n\nPhoenix’s EVs will not gain wide acceptance unless Phoenix can reduce manufacturing and selling costs. Prices of Phoenix EVs range from $165,000 to $225,000, whereas prices of comparable traditional combustion engine vehicles range from approximately $90,000 to $140,000. Prices of the recently acquired Transit Bus business, prices range from $650,000 to $1,100,000. The cost difference is due to the incremental cost of electric drivetrain, including lithium-ion batteries, motors, inverter and control software, coupled with the relatively low volume of production, leading to higher overheads.\n\nIn addition, government subsidies and incentives, including those available in California, are important for the cost-competitiveness of Phoenix’s EVs, and Phoenix’s growth and prospects depend in part on the availability and amounts of these subsidies and incentives. Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and incentives because of budgetary challenges, policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of electric vehicles, or other reasons may impair the cost-competitiveness of Phoenix’s EVs.\n\nThe range of Phoenix’s existing EVs is limited, compared with that of traditional vehicles.\n\nWhereas traditional combustion engine medium-duty vehicles may travel from 240 to 350 miles before refueling, Phoenix’s existing EVs have a maximum range of 160 miles and minimum recharging time of five to six hours. Currently, Phoenix’s EVs can be charged only at the owner’s location or select public charging locations using compatible charging equipment, further limiting the EVs to local use. Accordingly, potential customers needing vehicles with longer ranges or quicker turnaround of depleted electric energy supply may find Phoenix’s products relatively less attractive.\n\nWe may experience significant delays in the design, manufacture, financing, regulatory approval, launch and delivery of our vehicles, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nOur future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to develop, manufacture, market and sell our vehicles. Any delay in the financing, design, manufacture, regulatory approval, launch or delivery of our vehicles could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could cause liquidity constraints. Vehicle manufacturers often experience delays in the design, manufacture, and commercial release of new products. To the extent we delay the launch of our vehicles, our growth prospects could be adversely affected as we may fail to establish or grow our market share. Furthermore, we rely on third-party suppliers for the provision and development of the key components and materials used in our vehicles. To the extent our suppliers experience any delays in providing us with or developing necessary components we could experience delays in delivering on our timelines.\n\nAll of Phoenix’s current range of products are built on Ford’s E-450 chassis. A decision by Ford to offer an electric version of this chassis, directly, would impact the viability of Phoenix’s current products.\n\nPhoenix currently builds all its products on Ford’s E-450 chassis. Ford does not offer an electric version of this chassis, due to the relatively small market size for medium-duty electric vehicles. As volumes increase, there is a potential risk of Ford’s launching an electric version of Ford’s E-450 chassis directly from the factory, negating the need for Phoenix’s current range of products. \n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAdditionally, a shortage in the availability of this chassis would impact Phoenix’s capability to produce and fulfill customer’s orders in a timely manner.\n\nOur future growth is dependent upon the willingness of operators of commercial vehicle fleets to adopt electric vehicles and upon our ability to produce, sell and service vehicles that meet their needs. If the market for commercial electric vehicles does not develop as we expect, or if it develops slower than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\n\nOur growth requires adoption of commercial vehicle operators to adopt EVs for their fleets and on our ability to produce, sell and service vehicles that meet their needs. EVs’ use in the medium-duty commercial vehicle market is a relatively new development, particularly in the United States, and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving government regulation, industry standards, and customer views of the merits of using electric vehicles in their businesses. This process has been slow, as, without including the impact of government or other subsidies and incentives, the purchase prices for Phoenix’s EVs currently is higher than those for diesel-fueled vehicles. The relatively low price of oil has also hurt Phoenix’s over the last few years.\n\nPhoenix must educate fleet managers regarding the economic benefits that Phoenix believes result over the life of its EVs. Phoenix believes that these benefits depend on the following:\n\n●| the difference in the initial purchase prices of commercial electric vehicles and vehicles with comparable gross vehicle weight powered by internal combustion engines or hybrids, both including the effect of government and other subsidies and incentives designed to promote the purchase of electric vehicles;  \n---|---  \n●| the total cost of ownership of the vehicle over its expected life, which includes the initial purchase price and ongoing operating and maintenance costs;  \n---|---  \n●| the availability and terms of financing options for purchases of vehicles and, for commercial electric vehicles, financing options for battery systems;  \n---|---  \n●| the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles and future regulations requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles;  \n---|---  \n●| government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;  \n---|---  \n●| fuel prices, including volatility in the cost of diesel fuel;  \n---|---  \n●| cost and availability of other alternatives to diesel fueled vehicles, such as vehicles powered by natural gas or hybrids;  \n---|---  \n●| corporate sustainability initiatives;  \n---|---  \n●| commercial electric vehicle quality, performance and safety (particularly with respect to lithium-ion battery packs);  \n---|---  \n●| the quality and availability of service for the vehicle, including the availability of replacement parts;  \n---|---  \n●| the range over which commercial electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge;  \n---|---  \n●| access to charging stations and related infrastructure costs, and standardization of electric vehicle charging systems;  \n---|---  \n●| electric grid capacity and reliability; and  \n---|---  \n●| macroeconomic factors.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf, in weighing these factors, operators of commercial vehicle fleets determine that there is no compelling business justification for purchasing commercial EVs, the market for commercial EVs may not develop as, or may develop more slowly than, Phoenix expects which would adversely affect Phoenix’s business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nPhoenix has a limited number of customers, with which Phoenix does not have long-term agreements, and expects that a significant portion of our future sales will be from a limited number of customers. The loss of any of these customers could materially harm Phoenix’s business.\n\nA significant portion of Phoenix’s projected future revenue is expected to be generated from a limited number of customers. Phoenix has no contracts with customers that include long-term commitments that ensure future sales of vehicles. The loss of or a reduction in sales or anticipated sales to Phoenix’s most significant customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nAn inability to attract new customers for our Gen 4 products and future generations of products will substantially impact our ability to grow revenue or improve our financial results.\n\nOur growth will depend in large part on our ability to attract new customers. As we drive growth in our existing markets, and we anticipate that our sales activities will lead to additional orders and deliveries for our Gen 4 products, and, as a result, increase our base of customers. An inability to attract new customers would substantially impact our ability to grow revenue or improve our financial results. Further, we often receive binding and non-binding purchase orders from customers that are contingent on various factors, such as completing a successful pilot program, obtaining third-party financing or obtaining government grants, such as HVIP. In addition, some customers are interested in future products, not yet in our production. While we continuously strive to expand our product portfolio, developing new products takes a significant amount of time and expense, such as engineering work, sourcing new suppliers, marketing, testing and quality control. In addition, orders may be delayed for a number of reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including supplier delays, which may cause delays in our manufacturing process, or delays in customers obtaining financing. As a result, any such orders may not result in actual revenue in the near term or at all. Accordingly, revenue estimates and the amount and timing of work expected to be performed at the time the estimate of order backlog is developed is subject to change.\n\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate the supply and demand for our vehicles, which could result in a variety of inefficiencies in our business and hinder our ability to generate revenue. If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs or experience delays.\n\nIt is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. We will be required to provide forecasts of our demand to our suppliers several months prior to the scheduled delivery of products to our prospective customers. If we overestimate our requirements, our suppliers may have excess inventory, which indirectly would increase our costs. If we underestimate our requirements, our suppliers may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues. In addition, lead times for materials and components that our suppliers order may vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. If we fail to order sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, the delivery of vehicles to our customers could be delayed, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe face various challenges in scaling manufacturing, assembling, and converting processes effectively and quickly from low volume production to high volume production for our Gen 4 drivetrain products.\n\nWe have no experience to date in high volume manufacturing, assembling, and converting to commercial electric vehicles. We do not know whether we will be able to develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing, assembly and converting capability and processes, and reliable sources of component supply that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, as well as the production volumes we target. Any failure to develop such manufacturing, assembly and converting processes and capabilities and reliable sources of component supply within our projected costs and timelines could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Even if we are successful in developing our high-volume manufacturing, assembly and converting capability and processes, and reliable sources of component supply, we do not know whether we will be able to do so in a manner that avoids significant delays and cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, or in time to meet our commercialization schedules or to satisfy the requirements of customers. In addition, certain components we integrate may not be available on a consistent basis or in large quantities. Our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience disruptions in our supply chain or if we cannot obtain materials of sufficient quality at reasonable prices.\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe complexity in our business is expected to grow as we develop new products and services. We have limited experience in simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling our electric drivetrains as well as limited experience allocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple electric drivetrains. As we add complexity to our product line and introduce new products and services, we may experience unexpected delays.\n\nIf we are unable to scale our existing assembly processes and systems quickly while maintaining our current quality level, including as a result of supply chain constraints and inability to manage complexity in our business, we may be unable to meet our customers’ vehicle quality and quantity requirements or our forecasted production schedule or lower our cost of sales. As a result, we may not be able to meet our customers’ delivery schedules and could face the loss of customers, or be exposed to liability to customers to which we promised delivery, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. \n\nIf we fail to scale our business operations or otherwise manage future growth effectively as we attempt to rapidly grow our company, we may not be able to produce, market, service and sell our vehicles profitably or successfully.\n\nOur future growth depends upon our ability to maintain relationships with our existing suppliers and source suppliers for our critical components, and to complete building out our supply chain, while effectively managing the risks due to such relationships.\n\nOur success will be dependent upon our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with suppliers who are critical and necessary to the output and production of our vehicles. We also rely on a small group of suppliers to provide us with the components for our vehicles. The supply agreements we have or may enter into with key suppliers in the future may have provisions where such agreements can be terminated in various circumstances, including potentially without cause. If these suppliers become unable to provide, or experience delays in providing, components, or if the supply agreements we have in place are terminated, it may be difficult to find replacement components. Changes in business conditions, pandemics, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or that we do not presently anticipate could affect our ability to receive components from our suppliers.\n\nFurther, we have not secured supply agreements for all of our components. In addition, there is the possibility that finalizing the supply agreements for the parts and components of our vehicles will cause significant disruption to our operations, or such supply agreements could be at costs that make it difficult for us to operate profitably.\n\nIf we do not enter into long-term supply agreements with guaranteed pricing for our parts or components, we may be exposed to fluctuations in prices of components, materials and equipment. Agreements for the purchase of battery cells typically contain pricing provisions that are subject to adjustment based on changes in market prices of key commodities. Substantial increases in the prices for such components, materials and equipment would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins, if we cannot recoup the increased costs. Any attempts to increase the announced or expected prices of our vehicles in response to increased costs could be viewed negatively by our potential customers and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results.\n\nWe may be unable to adequately control the costs or maintain adequate supply of components associated with our operations.\n\nWe may be unable to adequately control the costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur significant costs related to procuring raw materials required to manufacture and assemble our vehicles. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on factors beyond our control. Our business also depends on the continued supply of battery packs for our vehicles. We are exposed to multiple risks relating to availability and pricing of quality lithium-ion battery packs.\n\nFurthermore, currency fluctuations, tariffs or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials and other economic or political conditions may result in significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins. In addition, a growth in popularity of electric vehicles without a significant expansion in battery cell production capacity could result in shortages, which would result in increased costs in raw materials to us or impact our prospects.\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nDisruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could harm our business.\n\nHistorically, we have experienced significant delivery delays and supply shortage with our BOM components, battery packs in particular. When encountered with supply disruption or shortage, our production plans and delivery schedules to our customers are to a large extent dictated by the timing of receiving these BOM components, or when a different supplier is fully qualified and customized into our product design. For example, COVID-19 has caused disruptions to and delays in our operations, including shortages and delays in the supply of certain parts, including batteries and chassis. Although we have worked diligently with our suppliers to mitigate the risks, we expect supply chain delays to continue to have a significant impact on our 2023 production and revenue and possibly thereafter. Any such supply interruption or shortage could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\nPhoenix EVs use lithium-ion batteries, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled, have caught fire or released smoke and flames. Such events could result in liability under Phoenix’s warranties, for damage or injury, adverse publicity and a potential safety recall, any of which would hurt Phoenix’s prospects.\n\nThe battery packs in Phoenix’s EVs use lithium-ion cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled can rapidly release energy by venting smoke and flames that can ignite nearby materials. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into flames have focused attention on the safety of these cells. These events also have raised questions about the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications. There can be no assurance that a field failure of Phoenix’s battery packs will not occur, which would damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death that subject Phoenix to lawsuits. Furthermore, there is some risk of electrocution if individuals who attempt to repair battery packs do not follow applicable maintenance and repair protocols. Any such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Any such adverse publicity could adversely affect Phoenix’s business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nIf our vehicles fail to perform as expected or have defects, our ability to develop, market and sell or lease our electric vehicles could be harmed.\n\nIf our vehicles were to contain defects in design and/or manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, our ability to develop, market and sell or lease our vehicles could be harmed. For example, the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software that will require modification and updates over time. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced. We currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term quality, reliability and performance characteristics of our buses, trucks, and other products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and repair any defects in our products before commencing the sale of our vehicles. Any product defects or any other failure of our vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims or significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\n\nWe are relying on third-party suppliers to develop a number of advanced technologies for use in our products.\n\nThere can be no assurances that our suppliers will be able to meet the technological requirements, production timing and volume requirements to support our business plan. In addition, the technology may not comply with the cost, performance useful life and warranty characteristics we anticipate in our business plan. As a result, our business plan could be significantly impacted and we may incur significant liabilities under warranty claims which could adversely affect our business, prospects and results of operations.\n\nWe are relying on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide us with products for our charger and material handling division.\n\nCurrently we are dependent entirely on third-party suppliers and partners for our chargers and material handling product lines. If these suppliers are not able to provide us with products due to supply chain constrains or other reasons, we do not have the capability or knowledge to produce these products locally. This would result in delays in getting end products to customers and negatively impact our business and results of operations.\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur success may be dependent on our development and protection of intellectual property rights.\n\nWe rely on confidentiality and trade secret protections to protect our proprietary technology. All new EV drivetrain and technical developments by us will be owned by us. Our success will, in part, depend on our ability to obtain patents and trademarks and protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology. We are currently maintaining our engineering under confidentiality agreements and other agreements to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary technology. Although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors, our agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property, particularly with respect to conflicts of ownership relating to work product generated by our employees, consultants and contractors, and we cannot be certain that others will not gain access to our trade secrets and other proprietary technology. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\n\nWe may not succeed in establishing, maintaining and strengthening our brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicles and components and our business, revenues and prospects.\n\nOur business and prospects heavily depend on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen our brand. If we are not able to establish, maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a larger base of customers. Our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen our brand will depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in the United States, Japan, the European Union and China, have greater name recognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong brand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.\n\nOur electric vehicles will compete for market share with vehicles powered by other vehicle technologies that may prove to be more attractive than our vehicle technologies.\n\nOur bus and light and medium-duty truck market currently is serviced by many manufacturers with existing customers and suppliers using proven and widely accepted fuel technologies. Additionally, our competitors are working on developing technologies that may be introduced in our target market. If any of these alternative technology vehicles can provide lower fuel costs, greater efficiencies, greater reliability or otherwise benefit from other factors resulting in an overall lower total cost of ownership, this may negatively affect the commercial success of our vehicles or make our vehicles uncompetitive.\n\nWe may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology as new entrants and existing, larger manufacturers enter the electric vehicle space.\n\nOur Zeus line of buses and trucks are designed for use with, and is dependent upon, existing electric vehicle technology. As new companies and larger, existing vehicle manufacturers enter the electric vehicle space, we may lose any technological advantage we may have had in the marketplace and suffer a decline in our position in the market. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our products to continue to provide products with the latest technology. However, our products may become obsolete or our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in or to create the necessary technology to effectively compete. As a result, our potential inability to adapt to and develop the necessary technology may harm our competitive position.\n\nThe failure to successfully integrate Proterra Transit Business Unit’s business and operations in the expected time frame may adversely affect the combined company’s future results.\n\n​\n\nAs previously reported, on January 11, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of the Proterra transit business unit (the “Transit Business”) pursuant to the asset purchase agreement with Proterra signed on November 13, 2023. The Company believes that the acquisition of the Transit Business will result in certain benefits, including revenue growth, certain cost synergies, drive product innovations, and operational efficiencies. However, to realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses of the Company and the Transit Business must be successfully combined. The success of the asset acquisition will depend on the Company’s ability to realize these anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of the Company and the Transit Business. The Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the asset acquisition for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\n​\n\n●| failure to successfully manage relationships with Transit Business customers, distributors and suppliers;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| failure of customers to accept new products or to continue as customers of the Company;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| customer and revenue attrition of the Transit Business in excess of anticipated levels;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| failure to qualify the Company’s products as a primary source of supply with OEM customers on a timely basis or at all;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| potential incompatibility of technologies and systems;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| failure to integrate and leverage the increased scale of the Transit Business quickly and effectively;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| potential difficulties preparing financial statements and integrating and harmonizing financial reporting systems;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| the loss of key employees of the Transit Business;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts to communicate the capabilities of the combined company; and  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| failure to combine product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| the risk of entering market segments in which the Company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such market segments have stronger market segment positions;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| failure to have adequate capital resources to finance the Transit Business operations and business  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nThe actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses or delays. If the combined company is not able to successfully integrate the Transit Business’s business and operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, the anticipated benefits of the asset acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\n\nPhoenix’s business requires highly technically skilled personnel, for whom Phoenix must compete for employment.\n\nPhoenix’s manufacturing and research and development require highly skilled electrical, mechanical, and software engineers. Competition for employment of such individuals is intense, and Phoenix’s ability to attract and retained and retaining them is essential to continuing its business. Growth of Phoenix’s business will depend upon its ability to compete for increasing numbers of such employees, and there can be no assurance that Phoenix will be able to do so. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel may materially and adversely affect our business operations. Any failure by our management to effectively anticipate, implement and manage the changes required to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe will also need to hire and train a significant number of hourly employees to expand our commercial manufacturing operations. Furthermore, in the event employees hired by us seek to join or form a labor union, we could be subject to risks as we engage in an attempt to finalize negotiations with any such union, including potential work slowdowns or stoppages, delays and increased costs. If we are unsuccessful in hiring and training an expanded workforce in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Denton Peng, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer.\n\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Denton Peng, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Peng is the source of many, if not most, of the ideas and execution driving our strategies and supply chains. If Mr. Peng were to discontinue his service to us due to death, disability or any other reason, we would be significantly disadvantaged.\n\nOur lack of effective internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may affect the market for and price of our Common Stock.\n\nTo implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 Framework). The Company has identified the \n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nfollowing material weaknesses, in the design or operation of internal controls, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data: (1) failure to maintain an effective control environment of internal control over financial reporting; (2) failure to develop an effective risk assessment process to identify and evaluate at a sufficient level of detail all relevant risks of material misstatement, including business, operational, and fraud risks; (3) ineffective monitoring activities to assess the operation of internal control over financial reporting; and (4) lack of sufficient controls designed and implemented for financial information processing and reporting and lacked resources with requisite skills for the financial reporting under U.S. GAAP.\n\nWe will be subject to the requirement that we maintain internal controls and that management perform periodic evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal controls. Effective internal control over financial reporting is important to prevent fraud. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the market for and trading price of our shares of Common Stock, may be materially and adversely affected if we do not have effective internal controls. Before becoming a public company, we were a private company with limited resources. As a result, we may not discover any problems in a timely manner and current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our shares of Common Stock. The absence of internal controls over financial reporting may inhibit investors from purchasing our shares and may make it more difficult for us to raise funds in a debt or equity financing.\n\nWe intend to implement measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to address the underlying causes of these material weaknesses, including (1) hiring more qualified staff and increasing resources with sufficient knowledge and experience to strengthen financial reporting; (2) setting up a financial and system control framework to ensure proper segregation of duty and review procedures, with formal documentation of polices and controls in place; (3) forming a task force to design and improve processes and controls to monitor operations and record financial data; and (4) devoting proper time by senior management to perform comprehensive review of procedures to assess risks and enforce effective accountability.\n\nIn addition, we anticipate that the process of building and improving our accounting and financial functions and infrastructure will require significant additional professional fees, internal costs and management efforts. We expect that we will need to implement a new internal system to enhance the management of our financial, accounting, human resources and other functions. However, such a system would likely require us to complete many processes and procedures for the effective use of the system or to run our business using the system, which may result in substantial costs. Any disruptions or difficulties in implementing or using such a system could adversely affect our controls and harm our business. Moreover, such disruption or difficulties could result in unanticipated costs and diversion of management’s attention.\n\nAdditional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may be identified in the future. If we identify such issues or if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may decline and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\n\n**Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock**\n\nThe market price of our securities may fluctuate and may decline.\n\nFluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. The trading price of our securities has been volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our securities.\n\n●| actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results;  \n---|---  \n●| success or failure of competitors;  \n---|---  \n●| our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the market in general;  \n---|---  \n●| operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;  \n---|---  \n  \n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| our ability to market new and enhanced services and products on a timely basis;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;  \n---|---  \n●| commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;  \n---|---  \n●| the volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;  \n---|---  \n●| short selling of our common stock or other securities;  \n---|---  \n●| any announced or anticipated stock or equity linked instrument offering by us;  \n---|---  \n●| any major change in the board of directors or management;  \n---|---  \n●| sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and  \n---|---  \n●| general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.  \n---|---  \n  \nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for automotive stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\n\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements as set forth in the Nasdaq listing rules, our common stock could be delisted from the Nasdaq, and if this were to occur, then the price and liquidity of our common stock, and our ability to raise additional capital, may be adversely affected.\n\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq. Continued listing of a security on the Nasdaq is conditioned upon compliance with certain continued listing requirements and continued listing standards set forth in the Nasdaq listing rules, including a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. There can be no assurance we will continue to satisfy the all the requirements for maintaining a Nasdaq listing.\n\nDelisting of our common stock could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock because alternatives, such as the OTC Bulletin Board and the pink sheets, are generally considered to be less efficient markets. An investor likely would find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy our common stock on an over-the-counter market. Many investors likely would not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons. A delisting of our common stock would likely to have an adverse impact on our stock price, inhibit or preclude our ability to rise additional financing, effect strategic acquisitions and may also materially and adversely impact our credit terms with our vendors.\n\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets by our existing stockholders, or the perception that such sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is doing well.\n\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that we or our stockholders intend to sell, a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our share incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\n\nOur Second Amended to the Amended Certificate of Incorporate authorizes us to issue up to 450,000,000 shares of our common stock and up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. We may issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plans or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\n\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, holders of our common stock may need to rely on sales of their shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\n\nIt is not possible to predict the actual number of shares we will sell under the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the “SEPA”), or the actual gross proceeds resulting from those sales. Further, we may not have access to the full amount available under the SEPA.\n\nOn November 22, 2022, we entered into the SEPA with YA II PN, Ltd. (“Yorkville”), pursuant to which Yorkville has committed to purchase up to $10,000,000 of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA. We have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares of common stock to Yorkville under the SEPA. As of December 31, 2023, we sold a total of 1,576,545 shares of common stock and the company received $1.9 million in net proceeds from the sales.\n\nAlthough the SEPA provides that we may sell up to an aggregate of $10,000,000 of our common stock to Yorkville, only 4,035,086 shares of our common stock, including the aggregate amount of 61,421 Commitment Shares issued to Yorkville, have been registered. If we elect to sell to the Yorkville all of the 4,035,086 registered shares of common stock, depending on the market price of our common stock prior to each Advance made pursuant to the SEPA, the actual gross proceeds from the sale of all such shares may be substantially less than the $10,000,000 available to us, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nIf it becomes necessary for us to issue and sell to Yorkville under the SEPA more than the 4,035,086 shares registered for resale in order to receive aggregate gross proceeds equal to $10,000,000, we must file with the SEC one or more additional registration statements to register under the Securities Act the resale by Yorkville of any such additional shares of our common stock we wish to sell from time to time under the SEPA, which the SEC must declare effective. Additionally, we would need to obtain stockholder approval to issue shares of common stock in excess of the Exchange Cap under the SEPA in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules, unless all applicable sales of shares of common stock under the SEPA equal or exceed the “Minimum Price” (as such term is defined in the Nasdaq Rules) or, as to any Advance, the issuance of the common stock pursuant to an Advance Notice would be excluded from the Exchange Cap under Nasdaq rules (or interpretive guidance provided by the Nasdaq with respect thereto), in which case, under applicable Nasdaq rules, the Exchange Cap limitation would not apply to issuances and sales of common stock under the SEPA. Any issuance and sale by us under the SEPA of shares of common stock in addition to the 4,035,086 shares of common stock registered for resale by Yorkville could cause additional dilution to our stockholders.\n\nWe are not required or permitted to issue any shares of common stock under the SEPA if such issuance would breach our obligations under the rules or regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. In addition, Yorkville will not be required to purchase any shares of our common stock if such sale would result in their beneficial ownership exceeding 9.99% of the then issued and outstanding common stock. Our inability to access a part or all of the amount available under the SEPA, in the absence of any other financing sources, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nIf we elect to draw down amounts under the SEPA, which will result in the sale of shares of our common stock to Yorkville, any such draw-downs may have a dilutive impact on our existing shareholders. Though we have been advised by Yorkville, and Yorkville represents in the SEPA, that Yorkville is purchasing the shares for its own account, for investment purposes, and without any view or intention to distribute such shares in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, Yorkville may resell some or all of the shares we issue to it pursuant to draw-downs under the SEPA and such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Risks Relating to Regulation and Claims**\n\nProduct liability or other claims could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nThe risk of product liability claims, product recalls and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the manufacturing, marketing and sale of all vehicles, including electric vehicles. Although we have liability insurance policies in place, that insurance may be inadequate to cover all potential product claims. Any product recall or lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional liability insurance coverage on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed or at all. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product recall could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future product candidates. We cannot provide assurance that such claims and/or recalls will not be made in the future.\n\nRegulatory requirements may have a negative effect upon our business.\n\nAll vehicles sold must comply with international, federal and state motor vehicle safety standards. In the United States, vehicles that meet or exceed all federally mandated safety standards are certified under the federal regulations. Rigorous testing and the use of approved materials and equipment are among the requirements for achieving federal certification. Our Zeus buses and trucks are subject to substantial regulation under federal, state and local laws and standards. These regulations include those promulgated by the U.S. EPA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) and various state boards, and compliance certification is required for each new model year. These laws and standards are subject to change from time to time and we could become subject to additional regulations in the future. In addition, federal, state and local laws and industrial standards for electric vehicles are still developing. Compliance with these regulations could be challenging, burdensome, time consuming and expensive. If compliance results in delays or substantial expenses, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nThe unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nAny reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the electric vehicle industry or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the electric vehicle industry generally. This could materially and adversely affect the growth of our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWhile certain tax credits and other incentives for alternative energy production and electric vehicles have been available in the past, there is no guarantee these programs will be available in the future. If current tax incentives are not available in the future, our financial position could be harmed. As federal, state, or local legislation related to electric vehicles or data protection continues to develop, we will likely be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our products, protective measures and internal processes to comply with such legislation.\n\nWe may be exposed to liability for infringing upon other companies’ intellectual property rights.\n\nOur success, in part, is dependent on our ability to operate without infringing on others’ proprietary rights. While we are not aware of any patents and trademarks which would cause our products or their use to infringe the rights of any third parties, we cannot be certain that infringement has not or will not occur. We could incur substantial costs, in addition to a great amount of time lost, in defending any patent or trademark infringement suits or in asserting any patent or trademark rights in a suit with another party.\n\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in building our manufacturing facilities.\n\nOur operations are and will continue to be subject to international, federal, state, and/or local environmental laws and regulations, including laws relating to water use; air emissions; use of recycled materials; energy sources; the protection of human health and the environment, natural resources and endangered species; and the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials.\n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nEnvironmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex, and we expect that we will be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws and regulations which may require us to change our operations, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. We have been required to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits, certificates, or registrations, many of which are difficult and costly to obtain and could be subject to legal challenges. Violations of these laws, regulations, and permits, certificates and registrations can give rise to liability for administrative oversight and correction costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury and fines and penalties. In some cases, violations may result in suspension or revocation of permits, certificates or registrations. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties, third party damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations, and reputational harm.\n\nContamination at properties we currently own or operate, will own or operate, we formerly owned or operated or to which hazardous substances were sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which can impose liability for the full amount of remediation-related costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for vapor intrusion and other exposure pathways or impacts to human health or the environment and for damages to natural resources. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We may face unexpected delays in obtaining the required permits and approvals in connection with our planned production facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and delay our ability to operate these facilities, which would adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, or any litigation that we may be subject to or involved in may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and the Nasdaq Stock Market on which we are applying for our securities to be listed. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq and other legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly.\n\nThose laws, regulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results, reputation and financial condition.\n\nAny product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. In the future, we may, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our electric vehicles or components (including our battery packs) prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls, whether caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, would involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and other resources, which could adversely affect our brand image in our target market and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe may not have adequate insurance coverage for possible claims, lawsuits, product recalls or other damages claims made against us.\n\nThe successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. As a recently public company with limited operating history we may find it difficult to obtain and maintain certain categories of insurance such as adequate D&O insurance, product liability insurance, garage keepers insurance, cybersecurity insurance, etc.\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nInsufficient warranty reserves to cover future warranty claims could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nOur EVs are sold with warranties, and as a result we need to maintain warranty reserves to cover any warranty-related claims. If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover such future warranty claims, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We may become subject to significant and unexpected warranty expenses. There can be no assurances that then-existing warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims.\n\n**General Risk Factors**\n\nEconomic conditions could adversely affect our business.\n\nUncertain global economic conditions, in particular in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business. Negative global economic trends, such as decreased consumer and business spending, high unemployment levels and declining consumer and business confidence, pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flow. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands, unfavorable economic conditions may negatively affect demand for our products.\n\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Since inception, the Company has not been a party to any material litigation.\n\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. If a cyber security incident occurs, we could suffer information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and our business and results of operations could be harmed.\n\nOur customers, and our industry generally, have become more dependent on digital and connected technologies to conduct business. We depend on digital and connected technologies to monitor our EVs, perform many of our services and to process and record financial and operating data, among other things. We also expect to increase our dependence on these technologies as we expand our offerings. Ensuring the secure and reliable processing, maintenance and transmission of this data is important to our operations and our customers. As cyber security incidents (including deliberate attacks) have increased in number, scope, and sophistication, energy assets (and related networks) may become the targets of more incidents. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, while we depend on certain business partners to store certain information regarding our customers and employees, these third parties may be a target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, or misuse of sensitive information. Our recourse against these business partners, if any, may be limited. In addition, we, our customers, vendors, and/or business partners may be unable to detect certain breaches (such as unauthorized surveillance) for an extended period of time. Our systems and controls for protecting against cyber security risks, and those used by our business partners, may be insufficient. The loss, misuse, destruction, unauthorized release, gathering, or monitoring of sensitive information result in significant financial losses, loss of customers and business opportunities, reputation damage, litigation (including any damages awarded), regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber security incidents. The reliability and capacity of our systems is critical to our operations. Any difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems, or any material disruption in our information technology systems or systems could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nPhishing scams could compromise sensitive data, harm our reputation, and lead to financial losses.\n\nPhishing scams involve malicious actors attempting to trick our employees into providing sensitive information or accessing malicious links, often through fraudulent emails or websites. If our employees fall victim to these scams, it could result in financial losses, damage to our brand reputation, and compromise of confidential or proprietary information. Despite implementing preventative \n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nmeasures and employee training, the risk of phishing scam remains, and a successful attack could cause disruption and have significant negative financial impact to our business.\n\nWe face risks related to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and any other conflicts that may arise on a global or regional scale which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation launched an invasion of Ukraine that has had an immediate impact on the global economy resulting in higher energy prices and higher prices for certain raw materials and goods and services which in turn is contributing to higher inflation in the United States and other countries across the globe with significant disruption to financial markets and supply and distribution chains for certain raw materials and goods and services on an unprecedented scale. The impact of the sanctions has also included disruptions to financial markets, an inability to complete financial or banking transactions, restrictions on travel and an inability to service existing or new customers in a timely manner in the affected areas of Europe. The Russian Federation could resort to cyberattacks and other action that impact businesses across the United States, the European Union and other nations across the globe including those without any direct business ties to the Russian Federation. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has continued to escalate without any resolution of the invasion foreseeable in the near future with the short and long-term impact on financial and business conditions in Europe remaining highly uncertain.\n\nThe U.S. and the European Union responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by imposing various economic sanctions on the Russian Federation to which the Russian Federation has responded in kind. The United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Australia and other countries across the globe have imposed their own sanctions on the Russian Federation. The United States, the European Union and such other countries acting together or separately could impose wider sanctions or take further actions against the Russian Federation if the conflict continues to escalate. Multinational corporations and other corporations and businesses with business and financial ties to the Russian Federation have either reduced or eliminated their ties to the Russian Federation in a manner that often exceeds what is required pursuant to sanctions by these countries. While we do not have any direct business or financial ties to the Russian Federation or Ukraine as part of our own business, the impact of higher energy prices and higher prices for certain raw materials and goods and services resulting in higher inflation and disruptions to financial markets and disruptions to manufacturing and supply and distribution chains for certain raw materials and goods and services across the globe may impact our business in the future. We will assess and respond where appropriate to any direct or indirect impact that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has on the availability or pricing of the raw materials for our products, manufacturing and supply and distribution chains for our products and on the pricing and demand for our products.\n\nIn addition, any deterioration in credit markets resulting directly or indirectly from the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. Adverse economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on accounts receivables that we accrue in the future due to credit defaults. As a result, a downturn in the worldwide economy resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and other conflicts with a global impact that may arise from time to time could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and/or financial condition.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ITEM 1 B. Unresolved Staff Comments**\n\nNone.\n\n**ITEM 1 C. Cybersecurity**\n\nCybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management program. We have made significant investments in processes, and technology to protect Phoenix’s connected vehicles, services, confidential business information, and employee and consumer personal data. We have implemented multiple and varied processes and technologies for the avoidance, identification, assessment, mitigation, and remediation of risks from cybersecurity threats and incidents designated to protect against the cybersecurity risk landscape. We are continuously assessing and enhancing our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities and regularly engage with the cybersecurity communities, third-party cybersecurity and compliance partners, internal stakeholders, and organizations leading best practices, to support our goals and objectives. At its core, our cybersecurity risk management program integrates multiple teams across the organization, including our operations team, with leadership and oversight by executive management, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (“Audit Committee”), and the Board of Directors (“Board”).\n\nGovernance\n\n _Board and Committee Oversight_\n\nOur Board has oversight responsibility for our overall enterprise risk management and delegates cybersecurity risk management oversight to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee oversees Phoenix’s policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including discussing with management (i) Phoenix’s major financial, cybersecurity, privacy and other information technology risk exposures; (ii) the steps that have been taken to monitor and control such exposures; and (iii) any material cybersecurity threats or incidents. The Audit Committee and the Board receive regular reporting from Phoenix’s management on the status of our cybersecurity program and ad hoc reporting on material cybersecurity threats and incidents.\n\n_Management’s Role_\n\nAt the management level, our COO and CFO are responsible for leading our cybersecurity risk management program and enterprise cybersecurity matters. The COO and CFO monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents. For potentially material cybersecurity threats and incidents, we escalate these to the CEO, and would raise such threats and incidents to our Audit Committee Chair and, as appropriate, to our Board as they arise.\n\nManagement of Cybersecurity Risk\n\n _Our Cybersecurity Risk Management Processes_\n\nOur cybersecurity risk management program provides a framework for handling cybersecurity threats and incidents by escalating risks, issues, and key decisions to management, the Audit Committee, and our Board. Our program is designated to protect our products and services, confidential business information (including intellectual property), and employee and consumer data and includes steps for detecting and monitoring cybersecurity threats and incidents, assessing the severity of such threats or incidents, identifying the source of such threats or incidents, including whether such threats or incidents are associated with a third-party vendor or service provider, implementing cybersecurity countermeasures and mitigation strategies and informing management, the Audit Committee, and our Board of potentially material cybersecurity threats and incidents. In addition, our operations team provides cybersecurity training to employees during the onboarding process and periodic basis thereafter, with specialized training and tabletop exercises for our core incident response teams and executive management on at least an annual basis.\n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ITEM 2. Properties**\n\nOur principal executive offices are located at its headquarters comprising approximately 39,043 square feet at 1500 Lakeview Loop, Anaheim, California. The lease on the Anaheim facility expires in March 2027. We currently carry out the production of our electric transit buses from a lease facility at 1 Whitlee Ct, Greenville, South Carolina. The Greenville Facility is leased by use at a rent of $1.3 million per year and the lease on Greenville Facility expires in June 2026. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current business operations and we will be able to enter into lease arrangements on commercially reasonable terms for future expansion.\n\n**ITEM 3 Legal Proceedings**\n\nAs of the date of this report, there are no pending or ongoing legal proceedings that are material to the Company’s operations or financial condition. We regularly review and update our disclosure to reflect any changes in our legal exposures.\n\n**ITEM 4 Mine Safety Disclosures**\n\nNot applicable.\n\n​\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**PART II**\n\n**ITEM 5 Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities**\n\nMarket Information\n\nOur common stock has been traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the Symbol “PEV” since June 8, 2022.\n\n**Holders of Common Equity**\n\nAs of April 10, 2024, there were 14 holders of record of our common stock. Such numbers do not include beneficial owners holding shares, rights or units through nominee names.\n\n**Dividends**\n\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date. The payment of cash dividends in the future is dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, the terms of any indebtedness and general financial condition. The payment of any cash dividends will be within the discretion of the Board at such time.

This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Item 1A.— Risk Factors” or in other parts of this annual report on Form 10-K.\n\n​\n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Basis of Presentation**\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of accounts receivable and allowance for credit loss, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of goodwill, fair value of derivative liabilities, and product warranties.\n\n**Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**\n\nWe believe that the following factors have had, and we expect that they will continue to have, a significant effect on the development of our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n●| BOM and Supply Chain Challenges. Purchased materials represent the largest component of cost of goods sold in our products and we continue to explore ways to improve cost structure of our products through better design, strategic alliances for sourcing, supply chain optimization, and, in some cases vertical integration. We believe that an increase in volume and additional experience as well as long term and strengthened supply chain partnerships will allow us to continue to reduce our Bill of Materials (“BOM”), labor and overhead costs, as a percentage of total revenue. By reducing material costs, driving improvement in battery performance, increasing facility utilization rates and achieving better economies of scale, we can reduce prices while maintaining or growing gross margins of our products to further lower customers’ total cost of ownership (“TCO”) and help accelerate commercial electric vehicle adoption. Because we rely on third party suppliers for the development, manufacture, and development of many of the key components and materials used in our vehicles, we have been affected by industry-wide challenges such as significant delivery delays and supply shortages of certain BOM components. While we continue to focus on mitigating risks to our operations and supply chain in the current industry environment, we expect that these industry-wide trends will continue to affect our ability and the ability of our suppliers to obtain parts and components on a timely basis for the foreseeable future, having a significant impact on our business and results of operations in 2023 and possibly thereafter.  \n---|---  \n●| Availability of Funding to Develop Products and Scale Production. Our results are impacted by our ability to sell our electrification solutions and services to new and existing customers. We have had initial success with selling to our fleet customers. In order to sell additional products to new and existing customers, we will require substantial additional capital to develop our products and services, ramp up production and support expansion. Although we pursue an asset light strategy, we expect that both our capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we continue to invest in our technology, research and development efforts, obtain, maintain and improve our operational, financial and management information systems, hire additional personnel, obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio. Until we can generate sufficient revenue from vehicle sales, we expect to primarily finance our operations through proceeds from public or private stock offering, debt financings including but not limited to term loans, revolving line of credit and equity linked instruments, and potentially federal and state incentive funding programs. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements, will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our research and development efforts, the lead time for various components in our supply chain, and our ability to successfully manage and control costs and scale our operations.  \n---|---  \n●| Government Subsidies and Incentive Policies. With growing emphasis on improving air quality around our communities, large states like California are mandating key end user segments to switch to zero emission transportation options. Some of the key regulations driving growth in our addressable market include:  \n---|---  \n●| requiring all transit buses in California to be zero emissions by 2040;   \n---|---  \n●| requiring all airport shuttles in California to be all electric by 2035,   \n---|---  \n●| requiring at least 50% of all medium-duty trucks sold in California to electric by 2030,   \n---|---  \n  \n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| requiring specific end user segments like drayage and yard trucks to go electric.   \n---|---  \n  \nOther states like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts are also expected to bring in regulatory requirements for key end user segments like, transit agencies and school buses to switch to all electric transportation options. Fifteen other states including Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington have committed to follow California’s Advanced Clean Trucks Regulation. Primarily driven by the urgent need to meet carbon and greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, various state and federal agencies are also supporting the switch to zero emission transportation, providing a host of funding and incentive support to develop, demonstrate and deploy zero emission transportation solutions. Some of the key funding / incentives driving adoption of electric medium duty vehicles include:\n\n●| the California Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project, which offers a minimum of $60,000 per vehicle as incentive for Class 4 electric vehicles registered and operating in the state;   \n---|---  \n●| the New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program offering up to $100,000 per Class 4 electric vehicle;   \n---|---  \n●| funding from federal agencies like the Federal Transit Administration, covering up to 80% of the cost of procuring electric transit buses and various funding options covering up to 100% of the cost of procuring all electric school buses across key states.   \n---|---  \n●| Federal and various state agencies have established incentives for setting up both public and private charging infrastructure. Notably, the California Energy Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission have approved funding up to 100% of the cost of setting up chargers and related infrastructure. Large utilities like Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric have ‘Charge Ready’ programs that cover the entire cost of setting up charging infrastructure. Other states like New York, Chicago, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Ohio have also introduced programs to support fleets with their charging infrastructure requirements.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Results of Operations**\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **The Year Ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2023**| **December 31, 2022**  \n​|  ($ in thousands except share and per share data)  \nNet revenues| ​| $|  3,122| ​| $|  4,330  \nCost of revenues| ​|  3,398| ​|  3,510  \nGross (loss) profit| ​|  (276)| ​|  820  \nOperating expenses:| ​| ​| ​|  ​  \nSelling, general and administrative| ​|  14,902| ​|  13,970  \nProvision for credit loss| ​| ​|  360| ​| ​|  —  \nImpairment of long-lived assets| ​| ​|  4,968| ​| ​|  —  \nOperating loss| ​|  (20,506)| ​|  (13,150)  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOther income (expense):| ​|  ​| ​|  ​  \nInterest expense, net| ​|  (606)| ​|  (7)  \nLoss on sales-type leases| ​| ​|  (98)| ​| ​|  —  \nChange in fair value of derivative liability| ​| ​|  (319)| ​| ​|  —  \nEmployee retention credit| ​| ​|  697| ​| ​|  196  \nOthers| ​|  209| ​|  265  \nTotal other (expense) income, net| ​|  (117)| ​|  454  \nLoss before income taxes| ​|  (20,623)| ​|  (12,696)  \nIncome tax provision| ​|  (22)| ​|  (9)  \nNet loss| ​| $|  (20,645)| ​| $|  (12,705)  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet loss per share of common stock:| ​| ​| ​|  ​  \nBasic and Diluted| ​| $|  (0.97)| ​| $|  (0.65)  \nWeighted average common stocks outstanding| ​|  21,199,023| ​|  19,664,273  \n  \n​\n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nNet Revenues\n\nOur revenues were primarily derived from sale and lease of EVs, sales of forklifts and other revenue. Other revenue consists of engineering and maintenance service, sales of component and charging stations, shipping and delivery fees and others.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our revenues were $3.1 million and $4.3 million, respectively. The 27.9% decrease in revenues was primarily driven by the decrease in sales of all - electric lithium - ion forklifts and reduction in lease of EVs.\n\nThe decrease in sales of all - electric lithium - ion forklifts is mainly because of a slowdown in demand during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to less competitive price of the forklifts in the market. The reduction in lease revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 is mainly because, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we and certain customers amended agreements related to the leased EVs to renew the lease term. Since there was no grant of additional right - of - use assets, we did not account for the modified lease agreements as new leases but accounted for the original lease and the modified lease agreements as a combined lease. We reviewed the combined lease agreements and considered that (i) the lease term represents for the major part (greater than 75)% of the economic life of the underlying equipment; or (ii) the present value of the sum of lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that has not already been included in lease payments equals or exceeds substantially (greater than 90)% all of the fair value of the underlying asset. The modified EV lease agreements are thus accounted for as sales - type leases. Under sales - type lease accounting, at the commencement date, the lessor recognizes a net investment in the lease, based on the estimated fair value of the underlying leased assets at contract inception, and derecognizes the underlying assets with the difference recorded as selling profit or loss arising from the lease, and interest income from the lease is recognized over the lease term. Therefore, the revenue from lease of EVs decreased accordingly.\n\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we reassessed the estimates of variable consideration regarding government grant and noted a change in estimated transaction price resulting from our inability to timely delivery required number of EVs due to our significant cash shortage. Therefore, we recorded a reduction of $0.4 million revenue in the period in which the transaction price changes. This reduction also results in the decrease of our revenues during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022.\n\n​\n\nOur revenue breakdown by major categories is as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Year ended**|  ​| **Year ended**  \n​| **December 31, 2023**| **December 31, 2022**  \n​| ​| ($ in thousands)  \nSales of EVs| ​| $|  1,492| ​| $|  1,789  \nLease of EVs| ​|  369| ​|  551  \nSales of forklifts| ​|  410| ​|  1,251  \nOthers| ​|  851| ​|  739  \n​| ​| $|  3,122| ​| $|  4,330  \n  \n​\n\nDespite strong demand for our EVs as indicated by our sales backlog, cash shortage during the year of 2023, which in turn restrained our purchases and resulted in high turnover in our staffs, affected our production and thus impacted our results in the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nWe receive grants from government agencies related to sales and leases of EVs, and sales of chargers. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of governmental grant recognized as revenue from sales of EVs and chargers was $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of governmental grant recognized as reductions of the cost of sales for EV leasing was $47 thousands and $0.2 million, respectively and the amount of governmental grant recognized as reduction of carrying amount of sales - type leased vehicles was $0.2 million and nil, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the balances of government grants received were included in deferred income with amount of $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nOur costs of revenue consist primarily of direct parts, material and labor costs, inventory write-down, as well as shipping and delivery and other costs.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our costs of revenue were $3.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. Despite decreased revenue, the cost of revenues remained stable as the prior year, primarily due to obsolete inventory write-off of $0.3 million \n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nfor generation 3.5 as well as the $0.4 million reduction of revenue due to change in estimated transaction price mentioned in the net revenues above during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nGross Margin\n\nGross (loss) profit is defined as revenues minus cost of revenues. Gross margin, stated as a percentage, is defined as the gross (loss) profit divided by the revenues.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our combined gross margin fell from 18.9% to negative 8.8%, driven by the following reasons: 1) lower margins of electric forklifts sold in 2023 since we lowered selling price from an average of $45,000 per unit to an average of $42,000 per unit mainly due to our forklifts are less competitive in the current market, 2) $0.4 million reduction of revenue due to change in estimated transaction price as mentioned in the net revenues above, and 3) obsolete inventory write-off of $0.3 million as mentioned in the cost of revenue above.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses consist of selling, general, administrative expenses, provision for credit loss, and impairment of long-lived assets.\n\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses which consist primarily of salaries, research and development, professional service fees, rent expense, and office supplies expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our general and administrative expenses were $14.9 million and $14.0 million, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly due to the increase in research and development costs for Gen 4 product, where a significant portion of design and engineering work were outsourced to third party vendors and partners and partially reduced by the decrease in staff/payroll cost due to resignation of employees.\n\nThe provision for credit loss was $0.4 million and nil for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The provision for credit loss for 2023 was mainly due to the provision for security deposit of our previous lease of $0.2 million due to our early termination of the lease as well as provision for prepaid expenses for certain R&D projects of $0.2 million, which were suspended due to our severe cash shortage.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, impairment loss recorded for property and equipment was $0.5 million and nil, respectively. The impairment was due to the retirement of the vehicles in 2023.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, impairment loss recorded for intangible assets was $1.1 million and nil, respectively, and impairment loss recorded for our right - of - use assets was $3.4 million and nil, respectively. The impairment was due to uncertainty to bring future economic benefit to our business.\n\nOther Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income (expense), net includes the followings:\n\n_Interest Expense, net_\n\nOur interest expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.6 million and $7 thousands, respectively. The increased interest expenses were mainly due to debt discount amortization and interest expense for convertible notes and short term borrowing.\n\n_Other income_\n\nOur other income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $0.2 million, primarily due to forgiveness of long-aged payables. Our other income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $0.3 million, primarily due to forgiveness of PPP loan, and partially offset by a loss related to a phishing scam.\n\n​\n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n _Loss on sales - type lease_\n\nOur loss on sales - type lease for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.1 million and nil, respectively, primarily due to the modified EV lease agreements were accounted for as sales - type leases in 2023. However, there was a loss generated from these sales-type leases due to our inability to obtain government grant in relation to these EV lease agreements, resulting from our inability to timely deliver required number of EVs due to our significant cash shortage as mentioned in net revenues above.\n\n_Change in fair value of derivative liability_\n\nOur loss in change in fair value of derivative liability for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.3 million and nil, respectively. The loss was due to mark to market of derivative liability from recognition date to December 31, 2023.\n\n_Employee retention credit_\n\nOur employee retention credit for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The increase was mainly due to more employee retention credit was approved and granted by Internal Revenue Service in 2023.\n\nNet Loss\n\nAs a result of the above factors, our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $20.6 million, and $12.7 million, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates and assumptions on our own historical data and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\n\nOur expectations regarding the future are based on available information and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and accurate, which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.\n\nThe critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates that we believe to have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below, which should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other disclosures included in this prospectus. When reviewing our financial statements, you should consider:\n\n●| our selection of critical accounting policies;  \n---|---  \n●| the judgments and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies;  \n---|---  \n●| the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions;  \n---|---  \n  \nOur critical accounting policies and practices include the following: (i) Revenue recognition; (ii) Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill; (iii) Inventories; (iv) Accounts receivable and allowance for credit loss; (v) Product warranties; (vi) Derivative Instruments; and (vii) Income taxes. See Note 3—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for the disclosure of these accounting policies. We believe the following accounting estimates involve the most significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements.\n\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We consider our critical accounting estimates include (i) accounts receivables \n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nand allowance for credit loss; (ii) impairment of long-lived assets; (iii) impairment of goodwill; (iv) fair value of derivative liabilities; and (v) product warranties.\n\n**Accounts receivables and allowance for credit loss**\n\nThe Company grants open credit terms to credit-worthy customers. Accounts receivable are primarily related to sales of EV, EV components, and forklifts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments — Credit Losses using the modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit from January 1, 2020. Management used an expected credit loss model for the impairment of trading receivables as of period ends. Management believes the aging of accounts receivable is a reasonable parameter to estimate expected credit loss, and determines expected credit losses for accounts receivables using an aging schedule as of period ends. The expected credit loss rates under each aging schedule were developed on basis of the average historical loss rates from previous years, and adjusted to reflect the effects of those differences in current conditions and forecasted changes. Management measured the expected credit losses of accounts receivable on a collective basis. When an accounts receivable does not share risk characteristics with other accounts receivables, management will evaluate such accounts receivable for expected credit loss on an individual basis. Doubtful accounts balances are written off and deducted from allowance, when receivables are deemed uncollectible, after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. There was a reversal of credit loss for accounts receivable of $10 thousands during the year ended December 31, 2023. Provision for credit loss was nil for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n**Impairment of long-lived assets**\n\nAll long-lived assets of the Company, which include tangible long-lived assets, right-of-used assets and intangible long-lived assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value.\n\nThe judgments and estimates involved in identifying and quantifying the impairment of long-lived assets involve inherent uncertainties, and the measurement of the fair value is dependent on the accuracy of the assumptions used in making the estimates and how those estimates compare to our future operating performance. The key assumptions and estimates include projections of future operating results and cash flows of each asset group that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans, historical performance and growth rate, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each asset group that could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe recorded $5.0 million and nil impairment of long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n**Impairment of goodwill**\n\nWe assess goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350-20, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other: Goodwill (“ASC 350-20”), which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\nWe have only one reporting unit as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We have the option to assess qualitative factors first to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative test in accordance with ASC 350-20. In the qualitative assessment, we consider primary factors such as industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations. If we believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgment and estimates.\n\nWe performed the annual goodwill impairment assessment on December 31, 2023 by considering all qualitative factors including the comparison of market cap and the carrying amount of the reporting unit (after the impairment of long-lived assets). We recorded nil impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Fair value of derivative liabilities**\n\nThe Company evaluates its convertible debt to determine if the contract or embedded component of the contract qualifies as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 480, “Distinguish by Liabilities from Equity”, and ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative, if required to be bifurcated, is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a derivative instrument. The Company recognizes the embedded component of the convertible debt as derivative liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The derivative liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe derivative liabilities embedded in convertible debt issued in June 2023 were initially measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation (“MCS”) and the derivative liabilities embedded in convertible debt issued in October 2023 were initially measured at fair value using a binominal tree model, both derivative liabilities are subsequently re-measured at fair value using a binominal tree model as of December 31, 2023. Both MCS and binominal tree model consider all relevant assumptions current at the date of valuation (i.e., share price, exercise price, term, volatility, risk-free rate, probability of dilutive term, and expected time to conversion). The determination of the fair value of the derivative liabilities may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly. The selection of methodology to measure the fair value also involves judgment.\n\nDerivative liability as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.2 million and nil, respectively, with $319 thousands and nil loss on change in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n**Product warranties**\n\nThe Company provides warranties on all vehicles or components sold in addition to pass through warranties from third party component suppliers. The Company accrues a warranty reserve for the products sold by the Company, which includes the Company’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given the Company’s relatively short history of sales, and changes to the Company’s historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The Company considers the warranty provided is not providing incremental service to customers rather an assurance to the quality of the vehicle, and therefore is not a separate performance obligation and should be accounted for in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees.\n\nThe balance of warranty reserve was $289 thousands and $325 thousands as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nSee Note 3 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nWe had recurring losses from operations. We have incurred a net loss of $20.6 million and the net cash used in operating activities was $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, and as of December 31, 2023, working capital deficit was $4.9 million. We have incurred significant recurring losses and negative cash flow from operating activities and need to raise additional funds to sustain its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nFor the next 12 months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements, we plan to continue implementing various measures to boost revenue and control the cost and expenses within an acceptable level. Such measures include: 1) align capacity with demand and prioritize production for high margin products in our order backlog; 2) expand and strengthen strategic partnership to outsource a significant portion of design and engineering work for next generation product to third party vendors and suppliers to control overall development costs; 3) negotiate better payment terms with customers and for some of the new orders, require down payments; 4) implement comprehensive budget control and reduce operating expenses; and 5) calibrate capital allocation to manage liquidity and drive near-term goals without compromising long-term growth; 6) continue to proactively implement a robust capital market strategy to provide financing for our operations through proceeds from public or private stock offering, debt financings including but not limited to term loans, revolving line of credit and equity linked instruments, and potentially federal and state incentive funding programs.\n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nA summary of the cash flow activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \n​| ​| ($ in thousands)  \nNet cash used in operating activities| ​| $|  (3,652)| ​| $|  (14,866)  \nNet cash used in investing activities| ​|  (93)| ​|  (1,011)  \nNet cash generated from financing activities| ​|  6,639| ​|  13,583  \nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents| ​|  2,894| ​|  (2,294)  \n  \n​\n\nOperating Activities\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of (i) net loss of $20.6 million, adjusted by non-cash items of depreciation and amortization of $1.2 million mainly in relation to equipment, furniture vehicles, trademark and technology, provision for credit loss of $0.4 million related to security deposit due to our early termination of lease as well as prepaid expenses to certain R&D expenses due to project suspension resulted from our cash shortage, amortization of right-of-use assets of $0.8 million, warrants issued in connection with unclosed convertible note offering of $0.9 million, impairment of long-lived assets of $5.0 million in relation to property and equipment, intangible assets, and right-of-use assets due to uncertainty to bring future economic benefit to our business, write-down of inventories of $0.3 million to adjust our forklifts to net realizable value, loss on sales-type leases of $0.1 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities including (i) a decrease in inventories of $1.7 million due to decrease of purchase due to our cash shortage, (ii) a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.1 million due to the receipt of previous R&D project deliveries and no additional prepaid expenses on R&D projects due to cash shortage, (iii) a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.2 million due to collection and less sales near the year end, (iv) a decrease in lease liability of $0.3 million, and (v) an increase in accounts payable of $2.3 million due to our severe cash shortage;

Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this prospectus, the following trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments, or events for 2023 are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported consolidated financial information not necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial conditions:\n\n●| Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The $370 billion allocated to climate and clean energy investments dramatically expands tax credits and incentives to deploy more clean vehicles, including commercial vehicles, while supporting a domestic EV supply chain and charging infrastructure buildout. IRA transportation sector provisions will accelerate the shift to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by combining consumer and manufacturing policies. The IRA extends the existing tax credit for electric vehicles and establishes a new tax credit for used electric vehicles, as well as establishes a new tax credit for commercial ZEVs. Under the IRA, commercial ZEVs will be eligible for a federal tax credit of up to the lesser of 30% of the sales price or the incremental cost of a comparable ICE-engine vehicle, capped at $7,500 for vehicles under 14,000 pounds and $40,000 for all others. In addition, governmental entities may also be eligible to claim these credits. Vehicles’ final assembly must be in North America to be eligible for the federal tax credit, but commercial vehicles are exempt from the battery or mineral sourcing requirements that apply to consumer electric vehicles. The federal tax credit on charging equipment has been extended through 2032. For commercial uses, the tax credit is 6% with a maximum credit of $100,000 per unit. The equipment must be placed in a low-income community or non-urban area. The IRS has yet to release further guidance on specific aspects of the aforementioned credits. The announcement of the IRA and the delay in receiving IRS guidance as to the roll-out of the new tax credits has reduced the number of customer orders during the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, as many existing or potential customers are waiting to place orders until they are certain of the amount of tax credits available per ZEV. In addition, many customers are evaluating the size and type of ZEV they intend to purchase because the amount of the tax credit depends on the weight of the vehicle, among other factors. Furthermore, other government programs, such as the FTA’s Low- and No-Emission Vehicle Program or certain state programs, recently announced new funding and are in the process of making these funds available for eligible purchases. Until these processes are established, we believe customer orders may be delayed.  \n---|---  \n●| Supply-chain challenges. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we started to experience chassis and raw material shortages from suppliers. The challenge continues with the current development of our new generation electric vehicles. We need to source new components from various vendors which lead to longer lead times. In addition, because of the generation advancement, large capital spending is necessary to fund the project. Lack of cash flow on hand will also trigger the supply-chain challenges. As a result of these challenges, we have engaged with vendors to negotiate better terms and lower downpayment alternatives. We contracted with new suppliers to optimize costs, minimize supply chain issues, and prepare for an increase in future production. However, adding new suppliers, especially for chassis, increases requirements for working capital and places us at the mercy of price volatility. We expect supply chain challenges will continue for the foreseeable future.  \n---|---  \n●| Inflation and interest rates. We are experiencing cost increases due to inflation resulting from various supply chain disruptions and other disruptions caused by the general global economic conditions. The cost of raw materials, manufacturing equipment, labor and shipping and transportation has increased considerably. We expect higher than recent years’ levels of inflation to persist for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to fully offset higher costs through price increases or other measures, we could experience an adverse impact to our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Interest rates have also increased considerably. The increase in inflation and interest rates impacts the demand for our EVs, as customers may delay purchasing and/or have difficulty financing their purchases.  \n---|---  \n  \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nPhoenix has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition or results of operations that are material to stockholders.\n\n**ITEM 7A.

Controls and Procedures**\n\n**Disclosure Controls and Procedures**\n\n**(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures**\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as discussed below.\n\nNotwithstanding these material weaknesses, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for each of the fiscal years presented herein in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n**(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**\n\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 5d-15(f) under the Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2023. The framework used by management in making the assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, our management has determined that as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the purpose for which it is intended and determine there to be a material weakness.\n\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as required by Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404(a). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as required \n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nunder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023:\n\n(1)| Failure to maintain an effective control environment of internal control over financial reporting;  \n---|---  \n(2)| Failure to develop an effective risk assessment process to identify and evaluate at a sufficient level of detail all relevant risks of material misstatement, including business, operational, and fraud risks;  \n---|---  \n(3)| Ineffective monitoring activities to assess the operation of internal control over financial reporting;  \n---|---  \n(4)| Lack of sufficient controls designed and implemented for financial information processing and reporting and lacked resources with requisite skills for the financial reporting under U.S. GAAP.  \n---|---  \n  \n_Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_\n\nWe intend to implement measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to address the underlying causes of these material weaknesses, including (1) hiring more qualified staff and increasing resources with sufficient knowledge and experience to strengthen financial reporting; (2) setting up a financial and system control framework to ensure proper segregation of duty and review procedures, with formal documentation of polices and controls in place; (3) forming a task force to design and improve processes and controls to monitor operations and record financial data; and (4) devoting proper time by senior management to perform comprehensive review of procedures to assess risks and enforce effective accountability.\n\n**(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n**ITEM 9B.

Mr. Van received his BS in Finance from St. John’s University and his MBA from Cornell University.\n\n**Family Relationships**\n\nThere are no family relationships among our executive officers, directors and significant employees.\n\n**Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings**\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there have been no events under any bankruptcy act, no criminal proceedings and no judgments, injunctions, orders or decrees material to the evaluation of the ability and integrity of any director, executive officer, promoter or control person of our Company during the past ten years.\n\n**Board of Directors**\n\nOur board of directors currently consists of six directors, three of whom satisfy the “independence” requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Rule 5605 of the NASDAQ Rules. The Board of Directors has determined that John F. Perkowski, Steven E. Stivers, and Sam Van are independent under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Rules.\n\nA director is not required to hold any shares in the Company by way of qualification. A director who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in a contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction with our company must declare the nature of his interest at a meeting of the directors. Subject to the NASDAQ Rules and disqualification by the chairman of the relevant board meeting, a director may vote in respect of any contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction notwithstanding that he or she may be interested therein and if he or she does so his or her vote shall be counted and he or she may be counted in the quorum at the relevant board meeting at which such contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction is considered. Our board of directors may exercise all of the powers of our Company to borrow money, to mortgage or charge our undertakings, property and uncalled capital, and to issue debentures or other securities whenever money is borrowed or pledged as security for any debt, liability or obligation of our Company or of any third party.\n\n37\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Board Operations**\n\nOne person holds the positions of principal executive officer and chairman of the Board of Company. The Board has not designated a lead director. Given the limited number of directors comprising the Board, the independent directors call and plan their executive sessions collaboratively and, between board meetings, communicate with management and one another directly. In the circumstances, the directors believe that formalizing in a lead director functions in which they all participate might detract from rather than enhance performance of their responsibilities as directors. The Chairman of the Board chairs Board and stockholder meetings and participates in preparing their agendas. The Chairman of the Board also serves as a focal point for communication between management and the Board between Board meetings, although there is no restriction on communication between directors and management. The Company believes that these arrangements afford the directors sufficient resources to supervise management effectively, without being overly engaged in day-to-day operations.\n\nThe Board plays an active role, as well as the independent committees, in overseeing the management of the Company’s risks. The Board regularly reviews reports from members of senior management and committees on areas of material risk to the Company, including operational, financial, legal, strategic and regulatory risks.\n\nThe Board of Directors held 3 meetings during 2023. During 2023, no director attended fewer than 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and Board committees of which the director was a member.\n\n**Committees of the Board of Directors**\n\nWe have an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, comprised solely of independent directors.\n\nAudit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee consists of John F. Perkowski, Steven E. Stivers and Sam Van and is chaired by John F. Perkowski. The Board has determined that John F. Perkowski is an audit committee financial expert, as defined by the SEC rules. The audit committee assists the Board’s oversight of (1) the quality and integrity of our financial statements and related disclosure, (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) the independent auditor’s qualifications and independence, (4) the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors and (5) related-party transactions. The audit committee is responsible for, among other things:\n\n●| appointing the independent auditors and pre-approving any non-audit services to be performed by the independent auditors;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing and approving all proposed related-party transactions;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing with the independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and management’s response;  \n---|---  \n●| discussing the audited financial statements with management and the independent auditors;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing major issues as to the adequacy of our internal controls and any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls.  \n---|---  \n●| meeting separately and periodically with management and the independent auditors;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing with the general counsel the adequacy of procedures to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory responsibilities; and  \n---|---  \n●| reporting regularly to the entire board of directors.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Audit Committee held 3 meetings during 2023.\n\n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Duties of Directors**\n\nOur directors owe to us fiduciary duties, including a duty of loyalty, a duty to act honestly and a duty to act in what they consider in good faith to be in our best interests. Our directors also have a duty to exercise the skill they actually possess and such care and diligence that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. In fulfilling their duty of care to us, our directors must ensure compliance with our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time. Our Company has the right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached.\n\n**Terms of Directors and Executive Officers**\n\nThe members of the Board serve until their successors are duly elected and have qualified. Our officers are appointed by and serve at the discretion of the board of directors. A director will cease to be a director if, among other things, the director (i) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; (ii) dies or is found by our company to be or becomes of unsound mind; (iii) resigns his office by written notice to the Company; (iv) the board resolves that his office be vacated; or (v) is removed from office pursuant to any other provision of our memorandum and articles of association.\n\n**Material Changes to the Procedures by which Security Holders May Recommend Nominees to the Board**\n\nWe do not currently have a procedure by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Board.\n\n**Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance**\n\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and ten percent shareholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. We believe that, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, all filing requirements Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were not applicable to our officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners.\n\n**Code of Ethics**\n\nOur board of directors believes in strict adherence to the highest standards of business ethics and responsibility. We have thus adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to us and our directors, officers, employees and advisors. Certain provisions of the code apply specifically to our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, senior operating officer and any other persons who perform similar functions for us.

The 2021 Plan is a comprehensive incentive compensation plan under which we can grant equity-based and other incentive awards to our officers, employees, directors, consultants and advisers. The purpose of the 2021 Plan is to help us attract, motivate and retain such persons with awards under the 2021 Plan and thereby enhance shareholder value.\n\n_Administration_. The 2021 Plan is administered by the board, and upon consummation of this offering will be administered by a committee of the board, which shall consist of two of more members of the board, each of whom is a “non-employee director” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and independent” for purposes of any applicable listing requirements. Among other things, the committee has complete discretion, subject to the express limits of the 2021 Plan, to determine the directors, employees and nonemployee consultants to be granted an award, the type of award to be granted the terms and conditions of the award, the form of payment to be made and/or the number of shares of common stock subject to each award, the exercise price of each option and base price of each stock appreciation right (“SAR”), the term of each award, the vesting schedule for an award, whether to accelerate vesting, the value of the common stock underlying the award, and the required withholding, if any. The compensation committee may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding award, provided that the participant’s consent to such action is required if the action would impair the participant’s rights or entitlements with respect to that award. The compensation committee is also authorized to construe the award agreements, and may prescribe rules relating to the 2021 Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the compensation committee does not have any authority to grant or modify an award under the 2021 Plan with terms or conditions that would cause the grant, vesting or exercise thereof to be considered nonqualified “deferred compensation” subject to Code Section 409A.\n\n_Grant of Awards; Shares Available for Awards_. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, SARs, performance share awards, performance unit awards, distribution equivalent right awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and unrestricted stock awards to non-employee directors, officers, employees and nonemployee consultants of Phoenix or its affiliates. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2021 Plan shall be equal to ten percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis. Shares shall be deemed to have been issued under the 2021 Plan solely to the extent actually issued and delivered pursuant to an award. If any award expires, is cancelled, or terminates unexercised or is forfeited, the number of shares subject thereto is again available for grant under the 2021 Plan.\n\n_Stock Options_. The 2021 Plan provides for either “incentive stock options” (“ISOs”), which are intended to meet the requirements for special federal income tax treatment under the Code, or “nonqualified stock options” (“NQSOs”). Stock options may be granted on such terms and conditions as the compensation committee may determine; provided, however, that the per share exercise price under a stock option may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant and the term of the stock option may not exceed 10 years (110% of such value and five years in the case of an ISO granted to an employee who owns (or is deemed to own) more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of capital stock of our Company or a parent or subsidiary of our Company). ISOs may only be granted to employees. In addition, the aggregate fair market value of common stock covered by one or more ISOs (determined at the time of grant), which are exercisable for the first time by an employee during any calendar year may not exceed 100,000. Any excess is treated as a NQSO.\n\n42\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n _Stock Appreciation Rights_. A SAR entitles the participant, upon exercise, to receive an amount, in cash or stock or a combination thereof, equal to the increase in the fair market value of the underlying common stock between the date of grant and the date of exercise. SARs may be granted in tandem with, or independently of, stock options granted under the 2021 Plan. A SAR granted in tandem with a stock option (i) is exercisable only at such times, and to the extent, that the related stock option is exercisable in accordance with the procedure for exercise of the related stock option; (ii) terminates upon termination or exercise of the related stock option (likewise, the common stock option granted in tandem with a SAR terminates upon exercise of the SAR); (iii) is transferable only with the related stock option; and (iv) if the related stock option is an ISO, may be exercised only when the value of the stock subject to the stock option exceeds the exercise price of the stock option. A SAR that is not granted in tandem with a stock option is exercisable at such times as the compensation committee may specify.\n\n_Performance Shares and Performance Unit Awards_. Performance share and performance unit awards entitle the participant to receive cash or shares of common stock upon the attainment of specified performance goals. In the case of performance units, the right to acquire the units is denominated in cash values.\n\n_Distribution Equivalent Right Awards_. A distribution equivalent right award entitles the participant to receive bookkeeping credits, cash payments and/or common stock distributions equal in amount to the distributions that would have been made to the participant had the participant held a specified number of shares of common stock during the period the participant held the distribution equivalent right. A distribution equivalent right may be awarded as a component of another award under the 2021 Plan, where, if so awarded, such distribution equivalent right will expire or be forfeited by the participant under the same conditions as under such other award.\n\n_Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards_. A restricted stock award is a grant or sale of common stock to the participant, subject to our right to repurchase all or part of the shares at their purchase price (or to require forfeiture of such shares if issued to the participant at no cost) in the event that conditions specified by the compensation committee in the award are not satisfied prior to the end of the time period during which the shares subject to the award may be repurchased by or forfeited to us. Our restricted stock unit entitles the participant to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of a share of common stock for each restricted stock unit subject to such restricted stock unit award, if the participant satisfies the applicable vesting requirement.\n\n_Unrestricted Stock Awards_. An unrestricted stock award is a grant or sale of shares of our common stock to the participant that is not subject to transfer, forfeiture or other restrictions, in consideration for past services rendered to Phoenix or an affiliate or for other valid consideration.\n\n_Change-in-Control Provisions_. In connection with the grant of an award, the compensation committee may provide that, in the event of a change in control, such award will become fully vested and immediately exercisable.\n\n_Amendment and Termination_. The compensation committee may adopt, amend and rescind rules relating to the administration of the 2021 Plan, and amend, suspend or terminate the 2021 Plan, but no such amendment or termination will be made that materially and adversely impairs the rights of any participant with respect to any award received thereby under the 2021 Plan without the participant’s consent, other than amendments that are necessary to permit the granting of awards in compliance with applicable laws. We have attempted to structure the 2021 Plan so that remuneration attributable to stock options and other awards will not be subject to the deduction limitation contained in Code Section 162(m).\n\n**ITEM 12.

Transactions involving compensation for services provided to us as an employee, director, consultant or similar capacity by a related person are not covered. A related party is any executive officer, director or a holder of more than five percent of our shares of common stock, including any of their immediate family members and any entity owned or controlled by such persons.\n\nUnder our policy, where a transaction has been identified as a related party transaction, management must present information regarding the proposed related party transaction to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors for review. The presentation must \n\n46\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\ninclude a description of, among other things, the material facts, the direct and indirect interests of the related parties, the benefits of the transaction to us and whether any alternative transactions are available. To identify related party transactions in advance, we rely on information supplied by our executive officers, directors and certain significant shareholders. In considering related party transactions, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors takes into account the relevant available facts and circumstances including, but not limited to the risks, costs and benefits to us; the impact on a director’s independence in the event the related person is a director, immediate family member of a director or an entity with which a director is affiliated; the terms of the transaction; the availability of other sources for comparable services or products; and the terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties or to or from our employees generally. In the event a director has an interest in the proposed transaction, the director must excuse himself or herself from the deliberations and approval.\n\n**Director Independence**\n\nThe Board has determined that John F. Perkowski, Steven E. Stiver, Sam Van and Zhenxing Fu are “independent” under the current independence standards of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC and meet the criteria set forth in Rule 10A(m)(3) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\n\n**ITEM 14. Accountant Fees and Services**\n\nThe following table sets forth the aggregate fees by categories specified below in connection with certain professional services rendered by Marcum Asia CPAs LLP, our current principal external auditor for the periods indicated.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nAudit fees| ​| $|  350,000| ​| $|  285,000  \nAudit-related fees| ​|  —| ​|  —  \nTax fees| ​|  —| ​|  —  \nAll other fees| ​|  —| ​|  —  \n**Total**|  ​| $|  350,000| ​| $|  285,000  \n(1)| Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit and review of our financial statements and services that are normally provided by the above auditors in connection with statutory and regulatory fillings or engagements.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Audit related fees consist of assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of audit or review of our financial statements related to our SEC filings.  \n---|---  \n  \nConsistent with the rules of the SEC regarding auditor independence, our Board of Directors is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. Our Board asks our independent registered public accounting firm to provide a detailed description of its services each year as a basis for its decision-making. The Board evaluates the proposals based on four categories: audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and other services; and determines the proper arrangement for each service according to its judgment as to our needs over the coming year. Our Board pre-approves all audit and non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. The Board pre-approved 100% of the audit and audit-related services performed by the independent registered public accounting firms described above in fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\n\n**Pre-Approval of Services**\n\nIn accordance with the SEC’s auditor independence rules, the Audit Committee has established the following policies and procedures by which it approves in advance any audit or permissible non-audit services to be provided to the Company by its independent auditor.\n\nPrior to the engagement of the independent auditor for any fiscal year’s audit, management submits to the Audit Committee for approval lists of recurring audit, audit-related, tax and other services expected to be provided by the auditor during that fiscal year. The Audit Committee adopts pre-approval schedules describing the recurring services that it has pre-approved, and is informed on a timely basis, and in any event by the next scheduled meeting, of any such services rendered by the independent auditor and the related fees.\n\nThe fees for any services listed in a pre-approval schedule are budgeted, and the Audit Committee requires the independent auditor and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year. The Audit Committee will require additional pre-approval if circumstances arise where it becomes necessary to engage the independent auditor for additional services above the \n\n47\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\namount of fees originally pre-approved. Any audit or non-audit service not listed in a pre-approval schedule must be separately pre-approved by the Audit Committee on a case-by-case basis. Every request to adopt or amend a pre-approval schedule or to provide services that are not listed in a pre-approval schedule must include a statement by the independent auditors as to whether, in their view, the request is consistent with the SEC’s rules on auditor independence.\n\nThe Audit Committee will not grant approval for:\n\n●| any services prohibited by applicable law or by any rule or regulation of the SEC or other regulatory body applicable to the Company;  \n---|---  \n●| provision by the independent auditor to the Company of strategic consulting services of the type typically provided by management consulting firms; or  \n---|---  \n●| the retention of the independent auditor in connection with a transaction initially recommended by the independent auditor, the tax treatment of which may not be clear under the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations and which it is reasonable to conclude will be subject to audit procedures during an audit of the Company’s financial statements.  \n---|---  \n  \nTax services proposed to be provided by the auditor to any director, officer or employee of the Company who is in an accounting role or financial reporting oversight role must be approved by the Audit Committee on a case-by-case basis where such services are to be paid for by the Company, and the Audit Committee will be informed of any services to be provided to such individuals that are not to be paid for by the Company.\n\nIn determining whether to grant pre-approval of any non-audit services in the “all other” category, the Audit Committee will consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including the following four basic guidelines**:**\n\n●| whether the service creates a mutual or conflicting interest between the auditor and the Company;  \n---|---  \n●| whether the service places the auditor in the position of auditing his or her own work;  \n---|---  \n●| whether the service results in the auditor acting as management or an employee of the Company; and  \n---|---  \n●| whether the service places the auditor in a position of being an advocate for the Company.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n48\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**PART IV**\n\n**ITEM 15 Exhibits, Financial Statements and Schedules**\n\n**(a) 1.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ (deficit)/ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nExplanatory Paragraph — Going Concern\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 2, the Company has a significant working capital deficit, has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n/s/ Marcum Asia CPAs LLP\n\nMarcum Asia CPAs LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021**.**\n\nNew York, New

Contents](#TOC)\n\nPHOENIX MOTOR INC.\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n**(Amounts in US$ thousands, except share and per share data)**\n\n**1.** Description of Business and Organization\n\n**Description of Business**\n\nPhoenix Motor Inc. (“Phoenix Motor” or the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”) is engaged in design, assembly, and integration of electric drive systems for medium duty electric vehicles (“EVs”).\n\nPhoenix Cars, LLC (“PCL”), a subsidiary of Phoenix Motor, designs and manufactures zero- emission electric drivetrain systems for integration in medium to heavy-duty commercial fleet vehicles in United States. PCL also sells a range of material handling products including all-electric lithium-ion forklifts and pallet jacks. Phoenix Motorcars Leasing, LLC (“PML”), a subsidiary of Phoenix Motor, serves as a sales and leasing dealership for PCL in United States.\n\nPhoenix Motor was incorporated in the state of Delaware in October 2020. EdisonFuture, Inc., a subsidiary of SPI Energy Co., Ltd (“SPI”), is the parent company of Phoenix Motor. On November 12, 2020, EdisonFuture, Inc. acquired 100% of the membership interest of PCL and PML. Simultaneously, EdisonFuture, Inc. effected the transfer of 100% membership interests of PCL and PML to Phoenix Motor.\n\nOn June 8, 2022, the Company sold 2,100,000 shares of its common stock in its IPO, at an offering price of $7.5 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $13,438 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\n\n**2.** Going Concern\n\nThe Group had recurring losses from operations. The Group has incurred a net loss of $20,645 and the net cash used in operating activities was $3,652 during the year ended December 31, 2023, as of December 31, 2023, working capital deficit was $4,865. The Group has incurred significant recurring losses and negative cash flow from operating activities and needs to raise additional funds to sustain its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nFor the next 12 months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements, the Group plans to continue implementing various measures to boost revenue and control the cost and expenses within an acceptable level. Such measures include: 1) align capacity with demand and prioritize production for high margin products in the Group’s order backlog; 2) expand and strengthen strategic partnership to outsource a significant portion of design and engineering work for next generation product to third party vendors and suppliers to control overall development costs; 3) negotiate better payment terms with customers and for some of the new orders, require down payments; 4) implement comprehensive budget control and reduce operating expenses; and 5) calibrate capital allocation to manage liquidity and drive near-term goals without compromising long-term growth; 6) continue to proactively implement a robust capital market strategy to provide financing for the Group’s operations through proceeds from public or private stock offering, debt financings including but not limited to term loans, revolving line of credit and equity linked instruments, and potentially federal and state incentive funding programs.\n\nThere is no assurance that the plans will be successfully implemented. If the Group fails to achieve these goals, the Group may need additional financing to repay debt obligations, and the Group may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that financing sources are not available, or that the Group is unsuccessful in increasing its gross profit margin and reducing operating losses, the Group may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations and may materially adversely affect its ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should the Group be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\nF-7\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**3.** Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n**(a)** Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\n\n**(b)** Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on, among other things, the Group’s ability to operate profitably, to generate cash flows from operations, and to pursue financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\n\n**(c)** Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements include the allowance for credit losses, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, warranty reserves, and fair value of derivative liabilities. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in those estimates and assumptions.\n\n**(d)** Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe Group measures at fair value certain of its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities by using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially an exit price, based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n\n●Level 1 — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\n●| Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs (e.g., quoted prices for similar items in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar items in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rate and yield curves, and market-corroborated inputs).  \n---|---  \n●| Level 3 — Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting unit to develop its own assumptions.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Group uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value when available. If quoted market prices are not available, the Group measures fair value using valuation techniques that use, when possible, current market-based or independently-sourced market parameters, such as interest rates.\n\nThe carrying values of the Group’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payables, accrued liabilities and advance from customers, approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\nF-8\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**(f)** Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash accounts, interest bearing savings accounts and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n**(g)** Restricted cash\n\nRestricted cash represents bank deposits with designated use, which cannot be withdrawn without certain approval or notice. As of December 31, 2023, The Group had restricted bank deposits of $3,252, including: 1) $250 restricted cash deposited in an escrow account for part of the proceeds received from the Group’s IPO for two years from the date of IPO; and 2) $3,002 restricted cash deposited in an escrow account which was established to secure the acquisition of the transit business of Proterra Inc (see Note 22).\n\n**(h)** Accounts Receivable, net\n\nThe Group grants open credit terms to credit-worthy customers. Accounts receivable are primarily related to sales of EV, EV components and electric forklifts. The Group maintains allowances for credit loss. The Group adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments — Credit Losses using the modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit from January 1, 2020. Management used an expected credit loss model for the impairment of trading receivables as of period ends. Management believes the aging of accounts receivable is a reasonable parameter to estimate expected credit loss, and determines expected credit losses for accounts receivables using an aging schedule as of period ends. The expected credit loss rates under each aging schedule were developed on basis of the average historical loss rates from previous years, and adjusted to reflect the effects of those differences in current conditions and forecasted changes. Management measured the expected credit losses of accounts receivable on a collective basis. When an accounts receivable does not share risk characteristics with other accounts receivables, management will evaluate such accounts receivable for expected credit loss on an individual basis. Doubtful accounts balances are written off and deducted from allowance, when receivables are deemed uncollectible, after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\n\n**(i)** Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventories is determined on the basis of first in first out method. The cost of finished vehicles or kits comprises direct materials, direct labor and an appropriate proportion of overhead. The cost of forklifts comprises purchase price paid to the manufacturer, tariff and shipping costs. Net realizable value is based on estimated selling prices less selling expenses and any further costs expected to be incurred for completion. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances and are included in the cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n**(j)** Property and Equipment, net\n\nThe Group accounts for its property and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Cost includes the prices paid to acquire or construct the assets and any expenditure that substantially extends the useful life of an existing asset. The Group expenses repair and maintenance costs when they are incurred. Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---  \nFurniture, fixtures and equipment| 3 to 10 years  \nAutomobile| ​| 3 to 7 years  \nLeased automobile| ​| 3 years  \nLeasehold improvements| ​| The shorter of the estimated life or the lease term  \n  \n​\n\n**(k)** Intangible Assets other than Goodwill, net\n\nIntangible assets consist of technology, tradename and others. Amortization is recorded on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n\nF-9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**(l)** Impairment of Long-lived Assets\n\nThe Group’s long-lived assets include property and equipment, intangible assets with finite lives and right-of-use assets. The Group evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Group first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group from their use and their eventual disposition to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Any impairment write-downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amounts of the assets and a charge to operations would be recognized. As described in Note 8, Note 9 and Note 19, the Group recorded impairment on intangible assets, property and equipment and right of use assets for a total amount of $4,968 and nil for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n**(m)** Goodwill\n\nThe Group assess goodwill for impairment on annual basis in accordance with ASC 350-20, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other: Goodwill, which permits the Group to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. If this is the case, the quantitative goodwill impairment test is required. If it is more likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not required.\n\nQuantitative goodwill impairment test is used to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of impairment loss, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nThe Group performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment on December 31, 2023 and no impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n**(n)** Income Taxes\n\nThe Group accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n\nThe Group recognizes in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, management presumes that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. In addition, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The Group’s tax liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of the tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. The Group records interest and penalties related to an uncertain tax position, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. No reserve for uncertain tax positions was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Group does not expect that the assessment regarding unrecognized tax positions will materially change over the next 12 months. The Group is not currently under examination by an income tax authority, nor have been notified that an examination is contemplated.\n\nF-10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**(o)** Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Group’s accounting practices under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606” or “Topic 606”) are as followings:\n\n_Sales of EVs and kits_\n\nThe Group generates revenue from sales of EVs and kits. EV buyers in California are entitled to government grants when they purchase EV that qualify for certain government grant project. The Group applies for and collects such government grants on behalf of the customers. Accordingly, customers only pay the amount after deducting government grants.\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue on sales of EVs and kits at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon the delivery to or acceptance of the customer. The Group determined that the government grants should be considered as part of the transaction price because it is granted to the EV buyer and the buyer remains liable for such amount in the event the grants were not received by the Group or returned due to the buyer violates the government grant terms and conditions.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group reassessed the estimates of variable consideration regarding government grant and noted a change in estimated transaction price resulting from the Group’s inability to timely deliver required number of EVs due to the Group’s significant cash shortage. Therefore, the Group recorded a reduction of $366 revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 in the period in which the transaction price changes.\n\n_Lease of EVs_\n\nEV leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for direct leasing programs. The Group accounts for these leasing transactions as operating leases under ASC 842 Leases, and revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term.\n\n_Sales of forklifts_\n\nRevenue on sale of forklifts is recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon delivery or acceptance of the customer depending on the terms of the underlying contracts.\n\n_Other revenue_\n\nOther revenue consists of maintenance service, sales of component and charging stations, shipping and delivery fees and others. For maintenance service, revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term. For sales of component and charging stations, shipping and delivery fees and others, the Group recognizes revenue at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products or services to the customer, which typically occurs upon the delivery to or acceptance of the customer.\n\n_Disaggregation of revenues_\n\nThe Group disaggregates its revenue by four primary categories: sales of EVs, lease of EVs, sales of forklifts and others.\n\nThe following is a summary of the Group’s disaggregated revenues by revenue streams:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| Year ended| ​| Year ended  \n​| ​| December 31, 2023| ​| December 31, 2022  \nSales of EVs| $|  1,492| $|  1,789  \nLease of EVs| ​|  369| ​|  551  \nSales of forklifts| ​| ​|  410| ​| ​|  1,251  \nOthers| ​|  851| ​|  739  \n​| ​| $|  3,122| ​| $|  4,330  \n  \n​\n\nF-11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe following is a summary of the Group’s disaggregated revenues by timing of revenue recognition:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| Year ended| Year ended  \n​| ​| December 31, 2023| ​| December 31, 2022  \nOver time| ​|  854| ​|  1,007  \nPoint of time| ​|  2,268| ​|  3,323  \n​| ​| $|  3,122| ​| $|  4,330  \n  \n​\n\nA contract liability is the Group’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the balances of contract liability were included in advance from customer (current and noncurrent) with amount of $2,381 and $1,230, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Group recognized $466 and $803 as revenue that was included in the balance of advance from customers at January 1, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n_Lessor Accounting_\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group amended agreements with certain customers related to the leased EVs to renew the lease term. Since there was no grant of additional right-of-use assets, the Group did not account for the modified lease agreements as new leases but accounted for the original lease and the modified lease agreements as a combined lease. The Group reviewed the combined lease agreements and considered that (i) the lease term represents for the major part (greater than 75%) of the economic life of the underlying equipment; or (ii) the present value of the sum of lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that has not already been included in lease payments equals or exceeds substantially (greater than 90%) all of the fair value of the underlying asset.\n\nThe modified EV lease agreements are thus accounted for as sales-type leases. Under sales-type lease accounting, at the commencement date, the lessor recognizes a net investment in the lease, based on the estimated fair value of the underlying leased assets at contract inception, and derecognizes the underlying assets with the difference recorded as selling profit or loss arising from the lease, and interest income from the lease is recognized over the lease term.\n\nThe net investment in leases was $479 as of December 31, 2023, in which current portion of $249 was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, net on the balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2023, loss on sales-type leases was $98.\n\n**(p)** Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues for EV and kits sales includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overheads, shipping and logistics costs, and inventories write-down. Cost of revenues for EV leasing primarily includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles over the lease term and other leasing related charges including vehicle insurance. Cost of revenues from forklift sales primarily includes purchase price paid to manufacturer, tariff, as well as shipping and delivery costs. Cost of other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, as well as shipping and delivery and other costs.\n\n**(q)** Segment Reporting\n\nOperating segments are defined as components of a Group which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Group’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer, Xiaofeng Peng. Based on the financial information presented to and reviewed by the CODM, the Group has determined that it had a single operating and reporting segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n**(r)** Product Warranties\n\nThe Group provides warranties on all vehicles or components sold in addition to pass through warranties from third party component suppliers. The Group accrues a warranty reserve for the products sold by the Group, which includes the Group’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given the Group’s relatively short history of sales, and changes to the Group’s historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The Group considers the warranty provided is not providing incremental service to customers rather an assurance to the \n\nF-12\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nquality of the vehicle, and therefore is not a separate performance obligation and should be accounted for in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The balance of warranty reserves was $289 and $325 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n**(s)** Government Grant\n\nThe Group receives grants from government agencies related to sales and leases of its EVs. The government grants related to the sales of EVs should be considered as part of the transaction price because it is granted to the EV buyers and the Group receives such on behalf of the buyers to settle part of the EVs purchase price. The government grant received before the Group’s delivery of the EVs are recorded as deferred income and recognized as revenue when the EVs are delivered to the buyers, for the government grants the Group is entitled upon delivery of the EVs to buyers but not yet received, the Group records accounts receivable. For government grants associated with leased vehicles under operating leases, the grants are recorded in deferred income when received and are recognized to reduce the cost of sales during useful life of leased vehicles.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of governmental grant recognized as revenue from sales of EVs and chargers was $521 and $895, respectively.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of governmental grant recognized as reductions of the cost of sales for EV leasing was $47 and $214, respectively.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of governmental grant recognized as deduction of carrying amount of sales - type leased vehicles was $180 and nil, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the balances of government grants received were included in deferred income with amount of $362 and $503, respectively.\n\n**(t)** Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Group granted employees and directors stock-based incentive awards. These awards are in the form of options and unrestricted stock units. The Group measures stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards on their grant date and expenses over the period on a straight-line basis during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period). As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\n\n**(u)** Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Group evaluates its convertible debt to determine if the contract or embedded component of the contract qualifies as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 480, “Distinguish by Liabilities from Equity”, and ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative, if required to be bifurcated, is marked - to - market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. The change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity.\n\n**(v)****Loss per Share**\n\nBasic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to shareholders of common stock by the weighted average common stocks outstanding during the periods. Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to shareholders of common stock by the weighted average common stocks outstanding during the period adjusted for the effect of dilutive share of common stock equivalent (computed using the treasury stock or if converted method). Potential common stocks that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, 4,946,097 and nil potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the computation as their effects are anti-dilutive, respectively.\n\nF-13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**(w)** Leases\n\nThe Group adopted Leases (ASC Topic 842), using the modified retrospective transition method effective January 1, 2022. The Group categorizes leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance lease. The Group has no finance leases for any of the periods presented.\n\nRight-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Group’s rights to use underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Group’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date and ROU assets are recognized at amount of lease liabilities and any prepaid lease payments. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is the Group’s incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in the leases is not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. The lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise that option. The Group generally uses the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the ROU assets and liabilities.\n\nLease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Group determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The lease payments under the lease arrangements are fixed. Non-lease components include payments for building management, utilities and property tax. It separates the non-lease components from the lease components to which they relate. The Group recorded right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities of $404 and $4,368 in the consolidated balance sheets upon the initial recognition during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n**(x)** Reclassification\n\nCertain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or statement of cash flow of prior year.\n\n**(y)** Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nAccounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\n\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures updates required disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, though early adoption is permitted. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The ASU will result in additional segment information disclosures within the Group’s financial statements but is not expected to impact the Group’s financial results or financial position.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” that addresses requests for improved income tax disclosures from investors that use the financial statements to make capital allocation decisions. Public entities must adopt the new guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments in this ASU must be applied on a retrospective basis to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and early adoption is permitted. The ASU will result in additional income tax disclosures within the Group’s financial statements but is not expected to impact the Group’s financial results or financial position.\n\nThe Group does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nF-14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**4.** Accounts Receivable, Net\n\nThe accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| December 31, | December 31,   \n​| ​| 2023| ​| 2022  \nAccounts receivable, customers| ​| $|  171| ​| $|  870  \nAccounts receivable, governmental incentive| ​| ​|  305| ​| ​|  675  \nLess: Allowance for credit loss| ​|  (25)| ​|  (35)  \nAccounts receivable, net | ​| $|  451| ​| $|  1,510  \n  \n​\n\nThe movements of allowance for credit losses are as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| 2023| 2022  \nBalance as of January 1| ​| $|  (35)| ​| $|  (35)  \nAddition| ​|  (25)| ​|  —  \nReversal| ​|  35| ​|  —  \nBalance as of December 31| ​| $|  (25)| ​| $|  (35)  \n  \n​\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, reversal of credit loss for doubtful accounts receivable was $10 and nil, respectively.\n\n​\n\n**5.****Inventories**\n\n​\n\nInventories as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| December 31, | December 31,   \n​| ​| 2023| ​| 2022  \nRaw materials| ​| $|  865| ​| $|  2,251  \nWork in process| ​|  108| ​|  979  \nFinished goods| ​|  823| ​|  1,330  \nTotal inventories| ​| $|  1,796| ​| $|  4,560  \n  \n​\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, $289 and nil of inventories were written down to reflect the lower of cost or net realizable value, respectively.\n\n​\n\n**6.****Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets, Net**\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets, net as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consist of the following:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| December 31, | December 31,   \n​| ​| 2023| ​| 2022  \nPrepaid expenses| ​| $|  100| ​| $|  947  \nSales-type lease receivable (Note 7)| ​| ​|  249| ​| ​|  —  \nVendor deposits| ​|  131| ​|  135  \nPrepaid insurance| ​|  —| ​|  234  \nOthers| ​|  38| ​|  28  \nTotal prepaid and other current assets| ​| ​|  518| ​| ​|  1,344  \nLess: Provision for credit loss| ​| ​|  (162)| ​| ​|  —  \nTotal prepaid and other current assets, net| ​| $|  356| ​| $|  1,344  \n  \n​\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, provision for credit loss of prepaid expenses and other current assets was $162 and nil, respectively.\n\n​\n\nThe Group also provided for credit loss of security deposit of $208 during the year ended December 31, 2023, which was recorded as non-current assets as of December 31, 2022.\n\nF-15\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\n**7.****Sales-type Lease Receivable**\n\nThe Group entered into a total of ten vehicle lease agreements with certain customers during the year ended December 31, 2023 and the Group delivered vehicles under sales-type leases.

If the Company elect to sell to the Investor all of the 4,035,086 registered shares of common stock, depending on the market price of the Company’s common stock prior to each Advance made pursuant to the SEPA, the actual gross proceeds from the sale of all such shares may be substantially less than the $10,000 available to the Company, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s liquidity. The selling price is 93% of the market price as defined in the agreement. The Group paid YA Global II SPV, LLC, a subsidiary of the Investor, a structuring fee in the amount of $20 and also issued to the Investor common shares in an amount equal to $100 as a commitment fee. On December 21, 2022, the Group sold to the Investor 30,000 shares in amount of $30. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group continued to draw down amounts under the SEPA, which resulted in the sale to the Investor of 1,546,545 shares of common stock of the Company and the Group received $1,915 in net proceeds from the sale.\n\nOn December 29, 2023, the Group issued 77,327 restricted common stock of the Company to a consulting company to repay $100 consulting fee.\n\n**14.** Stock-based Compensation\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, 880,500 options were granted to a group of managements and employees of the Group, which are subject to an annual vesting schedule that vests 25% of granted options over the next four years. The exercise price was $0.01- $1.73 per share.\n\nOn September 30, 2022, 505,000 shares of unrestricted stock units were granted to a group of managements, and all units are vested immediately.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, 200,000 options were granted to a group of management of the Group, which are subject to an annual vesting schedule that vests 25% of granted options over the next four years. The exercise price was $0.82- $1.57 per share.\n\nThe Group measures employee stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards based on the grant-date fair value and recognizes the cost in the financial statements over the employee requisite service period. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the stock-based compensation expense was $38 and $1,046, respectively.\n\nDetermining Fair Value\n\n _Valuation and Amortization Method —_ The Group estimates the fair value of service-based stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Service-based options typically have a ten-year life from date of grant and vesting periods of four years.\n\n_Expected Term —_ The Group’s expected term represents the period that the Group’s share-based awards are expected to be outstanding.\n\n_Expected Volatility_ — The Group uses the average historical volatility of the Company to calculate the volatility for its granted options.\n\nF-19\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n _Expected Dividend_ — The Group has never paid dividends on its common stock and currently does not intend to do so, and accordingly, the dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.\n\n_Risk-Free Interest Rate_ —The Group bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation model upon the implied yield curve currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the assumption in the model.\n\nAssumptions\n\nAssumptions used in the determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards using the Black- Scholes model for stock option grants for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| 2023| ​| 2022  \nExpected term| 6.25 years | 6.25 years  \nRisk-free interest rate| ​| 3.88%-3.97%| 3.04%-3.97%  \nExpected volatility| ​| 132.4%-135.4%| 137.7%-169.3%  \nExpected dividend yield| ​| 0%| 0%  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table summarizes the Group’s stock option activities:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **Weighted-**|  ​| **Weighted-**|  ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **Average**|  ​| **Average**|  ​| **Aggregate**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **Exercise**|  ​| **Remaining**|  ​| **Intrinsic**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **Price**|  ​| **Contractual**|  ​| **Value**  \n​| **Shares**|  ​| **Per Share**|  ​| **Term**|  ​| **($000)**  \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022|  2,812,500| ​|  1.71| 8.93 years| $|  16  \nGranted|  200,000| ​|  1.20|  —| ​|  —  \nExercised|  —| ​|  —|  —| ​|  —  \nForfeited/expired |  (795,750)| ​|  1.84|  —| ​|  —  \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023| ​|  2,216,750| ​| ​|  1.66| ​| 8.26 years| ​| $|  39  \nExercisable as of December 31, 2023 |  1,441,438| ​|  1.71|  7.75 years| $|  12  \nExpected to vest as of December 31, 2023|  775,312| ​|  1.58| 8.51 years| $|  27  \n  \n​\n\nChanges in the Group’s non-vested stock awards are summarized as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **Weighted Average**|  ​  \n​| **Shares**| **Exercise Price Per Share**|  ​  \nNon-vested as of December 31, 2022| ​|  1,550,437| ​| ​|  1.71| ​  \nGranted| ​|  200,000| ​| ​|  1.20| ​  \nVested|  (486,681)| ​|  —| ​  \nForfeited/Expired|  (488,444)| ​|  1.72| ​  \nNon-vested as of December 31, 2023|  775,312| ​|  1.58| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nUnrecognized share-based compensation expenses at December 31, 2023| ​|  650,886| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nWeighted-average period of share-based compensation to be recognized| ​| 1.19 years| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n**15.****Convertible Note Payable**\n\nOn June 23, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Original SPA”) with certain investors, to issue and sell, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, up to $5,100 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s unsecured senior convertible promissory notes (the “June 2023 Notes”). The June 2023 Notes are subject to an original issue discount of 8.5%, and matures on the date that is 18 months after the date of issuance at the applicable closing. The June 2023 Notes accrue interest at the Prime Rate (as defined in the June 2023 Notes) plus 4.75% per annum if interest is paid in cash, or the Prime Rate plus 7.75% per annum if interest is paid in shares of common stock. The Company may, from time to time, prepay the principal amount owing under the June 2023 Notes, subject to a 30% prepayment premium, so long as the Company provides at least 30 business days’ prior written notice to \n\nF-20\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nthe holder of such prepayment. On June 23, 2023, the Company had issued $1,600 of principal amount of June 2023 Notes pursuant to the Original SPA.\n\nThe June 2023 Notes are convertible into common stock of the Company, at a conversion price equal to the greater of (x) $0.60 (the “Fixed Price”) and (y) 87.5% of the lowest daily VWAP (as defined in the SPA) in the seven (7) trading days prior to the applicable conversion date (the “Variable Price”), subject to certain adjustments including full ratchet anti-dilution price protection, as set forth in the June 2023 Notes. In respect of any conversion where the Variable Price is less than the Fixed Price (the “Alternative Conversion”), the Company will pay to the holder either in cash, or subject to the Nasdaq 19.99% Cap, in common stock of the Company equal to such conversion amount or interests, divided by the applicable Variable Price. So in essence, there is no floor price for the Conversion and Alternative Conversion together. Notwithstanding the foregoing, automatically following an Event of Default (as defined in the June 2023 Notes), without the requirement of the holder to provide notice to the Company, and subject to the provisions relating to the Nasdaq 19.99% Cap, the conversion price is equal to the lesser of the (x) Fixed Price and (y) the Variable Price.\n\nThus, the Group determined that the conversion feature and the alternative conversion features embedded within the June 2023 Notes meet the definition of embedded derivatives and the Group estimated a fair value of the derivative liability using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model at the date of issuance. As the fair value of the derivative liability is less than the face value of the June 2023 Notes, the fair value of the derivative liability of $294 was recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The original issue discount of the June 2023 Notes of $136 was recorded as a debt discount as well. \n\nOn October 26, 2023, the Company entered into the First Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Original SPA, with the same accredited investor. Pursuant to the Amendment, the “Funding Amount” under the Original SPA was increased to an aggregate principal amount equal to no greater than $9,667 while other terms remain unchanged. On October 26, 2023, the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a private placement, an additional $1,750 of principal amount (“October 2023 Note”) (the “Subsequent Tranche”) of the Company’s unsecured senior convertible promissory note.\n\nIn connection with the Amendment, the Company issued a warrant (the “October Warrant”) to the investor to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, with an exercise price equal to $1.30 per share, subject to full ratchet anti-dilution protection and other adjustments as stated in the Warrant, which Warrant is exercisable for six years on a cash basis or, if the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant are not registered within 12 months after the closing, on a cashless basis. The Group determined that the October Warrant meet the definition of equity instrument and estimated a fair value of the October Warrant using the Binominal Tree model at the date of issuance. \n\nThe October 2023 Notes are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion price equal to the greater of (x) $0.60 (the “Fixed Price”) and (y) 87.5% of the lowest daily VWAP (as defined in the SPA) in the seven (7) trading days prior to the applicable conversion date (the “Variable Price”), subject to certain adjustments including full ratchet anti-dilution price protection, as set forth in the October 2023 Notes. In respect of any conversion where the Variable Price is less than the Fixed Price (the “Alternative Conversion”), the Company will pay to the holder either in cash, or subject to the Nasdaq 19.99% Cap, in shares of common stock equal to such conversion amount or interests, divided by the applicable Variable Price. So in essence, there is no floor price for the Conversion and Alternative Conversion together. Notwithstanding the foregoing, automatically following an Event of Default (as defined in the October 2023 Notes), without the requirement of the holder to provide notice to the Company, and subject to the provisions relating to the Nasdaq 19.99% Cap, the conversion price is equal to the lesser of the (x) Fixed Price and (y) the Variable Price.\n\nThe Group determined that the conversion feature and alternate conversion feature within the October 2023 Note meet the definition of embedded derivatives and the Group estimated a fair value of the derivative liability using the Binominal Tree Model at the date of issuance. In addition, the Group considered that the October Warrants were issued in a bundled transaction with the October 2023 Notes, and the proceeds received from the transaction should be allocated based on the relative fair values of the base instrument and the warrants. Accordingly, the Group recorded the relative fair value of the October Warrant of $590, the fair value of derivative liability of $543 and the original issue discount and related issuance fee of the October 2023 Note of $254 as debt discounts, which offset the carrying amount of the October 2023 Note.\n\nOn November 10, 2023, the Company entered into Second Securities Purchase Agreement (“Second SPA”) with the same accredited investor, which the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a private placement, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, a $12,000 of principal amount of the Company’s secured senior convertible promissory notes. As of December 31, 2023, the closing conditions have not been met and Company has not issued any convertible notes according to the Second SPA. Furthermore, upon execution of the Second SPA, the Company also issued a warrant (the “Execution Warrant”) to the investor to purchase up to 1,000,000\n\nF-21\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nshares of the Company’s common stock, with an exercise price equal to $1.30 per share, subject to full ratchet anti-dilution protection and other adjustments as stated in the Warrant, which Warrant is exercisable for six years on a cash basis or, if the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant are not registered within 12 months after the closing, on a cashless basis. Although the Second SPA has not been closed yet, the Execution Warrants were issued during the year ended December 31, 2023, and the Execution Warrants can be exercisable no matter whether the Second SPA would be closed or not in the future.\n\nThe Group determined that the Execution Warrant meet the definition of equity instrument, and the Group estimated a fair value of Execution Warrant using the Binominal Tree Model at the date of issuance. The Group considered that the Execution Warrants were issued in a bundled transaction with a future convertible note offering, and the Execution Warrants were considered as issuance costs associated with the future convertible note offering and should be deferred and charged against the gross proceeds of the future offering as debt discount based on the relative fair values of the base instrument and the warrants. However, this future convertible note offering (Second SPA) is to be closed subject to certain closing conditions. The Group considered that it is less likely that the closing conditions could be achieved in the future and recorded the deferred costs as expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\nThe Group recorded interest expenses from debt discount amortization in interest expense, net in the statements of operations of $327 and nil for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively.\n\nThe Group recorded accrued interest of convertible notes in interest expense, net in the statements of operations of $147 and nil for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amounts of the Group’s convertible bonds are $1,860 and nil, net of unamortized debt discount of $1,490 and nil, respectively.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group recorded $881 in additional paid in capital for the issuance of Execution Warrant.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, there was no warrant exercised.\n\n​\n\n**16. Fair Value Measurement**\n\nThe Group identified derivative instruments arising from embedded conversion features in the convertible promissory note issued to an accredited investor (see Note 15). The following tables present the quantitative information about the Group’s Level 3 fair value measurements of derivative liability on a recurring basis in 2023, which utilize significant unobservable internally-developed inputs.\n\nAs of June 23, 2023, the derivative liability of conversion feature and the alternative conversion features embedded within the June 2023 Notes was measured at fair value on their initial recognition using Monte Carlo Simulation model, which were classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Valuation techniques**| **Unobservable inputs**| **Rates**  \nMonte Carlo Simulation| Expected term| 0.5 years  \n​| Risk-free interest rate| 4.86%  \n​| Expected volatility| 114.4%  \n​| Expected dividend yield| 0  \n  \n​\n\nAs of October 26, 2023, the derivative liability of conversion feature and the alternative conversion features embedded within the October 2023 Notes was measured at fair value on their initial recognition using Binomial Tree model. In addition, the derivative liabilities recognized from both June 2023 Note and October 2023 Note were measured on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition. As of December 31, 2023, these derivative liabilities were measured at fair value using Binominal Tree model, which were classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The valuation techniques were changed from Monte Carlo Simulation to Binominal Tree model because the Group considered that the Binomial Tree Model can incorporate changes in dividends and interest \n\nF-22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nrates over time, and can accommodates the option of early exercise by evaluating it at every node, which is more applicable to the Group’s convertible notes.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Valuation techniques**| **Unobservable inputs**| **Range of rates**  \nBinominal Tree model| Expected term| 0.98-1.50 years  \n​| Risk-free interest rate| 4.61%-5.21%  \n​| Expected volatility| 117.15%-127.38%  \n​| Expected dividend yield| 0  \n  \n​\n\nDerivative liability as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 is $1,156 and nil respectively, with a loss on change in fair value of derivative liability of $319 and nil recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe following method and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of October Warrant and Execution Warrant (Note 15) on a non-recurring basis: \n\nOn October 26, 2023, the Group issued to certain convertible note investor the October Warrant to purchase a total of 1,500,000 ordinary shares and Execution Warrant to purchase a total of 1,000,000 ordinary shares. Both warrants were valued using Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table presents the quantitative information about the Group’s Level 3 fair value measurements of warrants, which utilize significant unobservable internally-developed inputs:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Valuation techniques**| **Unobservable inputs**| **Range of rates**  \nBlack-Scholes model| Expected term| 6.00 years  \n​| Risk-free interest rate| 4.67%-4.83%  \n​| Expected volatility| 127.38%-128.66%  \n​| Expected dividend yield| 0  \n  \n​\n\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:\n\nThe Group measures its property, equipment, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may no longer be recoverable. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or conditions indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may be greater than its fair value. Impairment testing compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value.\n\n​\n\n**17.** Income Taxes\n\nLoss before provision for income taxes is attributable to the following geographic locations for the years ended December 31:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nUnited States|  (20,623)|  (12,696)  \nForeign| ​|  —| ​|  —  \nTotal loss before income taxes|  (20,623)|  (12,696)  \n  \n​\n\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| 2023| 2022  \nCurrent tax:| ​| ​  \nFederal tax| ​| **$**| **—**|  ​| $|  —  \nState tax| ​|  22| ​|  9  \nTotal current tax| ​| ​|  22| ​| ​|  9  \nDeferred tax:| ​| ​|  —| ​|  —  \nFederal tax| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —  \nState tax| ​|  —| ​|  —  \nTotal deferred tax| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —  \nTotal provision for income taxes| ​| $|  22| ​| $|  9  \n  \n​\n\nF-23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe reconciliation between the actual income tax expense and income tax computed by applying the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| 2023| 2022  \nProvision for income taxes at U.S. Federal statutory rate|  21.00| %|  21.00| %  \nState taxes, net of federal benefit|  7.20| %|  13.35| %  \nNon-deductible expenses|  0.72| %|  1.53| %  \nCredits|  1.98| %|  (0.70)| %  \nChange in valuation allowance|  (30.90)| %|  (35.39)| %  \nOther| ​|  0.00| %|  0.14| %  \n​|  (0.00)| %|  (0.07)| %  \n  \n​\n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of loss carry forwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Presented below are the significant components of the Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities for federal, state and foreign income taxes as of December 31:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| 2023| 2022  \nDeferred tax assets:| ​| ​  \nNet operating loss carry forwards| ​| $|  11,320| ​| $|  8,426  \nCredits and Incentives| ​|  1,507| ​|  1,246  \nResearch and development expense| ​| ​|  1,542| ​| ​|  309  \nASC 842 Lease liability and Right-of-use Asset| ​| ​|  1,119| ​| ​|  53  \nAccruals and reserves| ​|  587| ​|  (90)  \nProperty and equipment| ​|  (44)| ​|  (293)  \nOther temporary differences| ​|  390| ​|  170  \nLess: valuation allowance| ​|  (16,421)| ​|  (9,821)  \nTotal deferred tax assets| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —  \n  \n​\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group had net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $39,047, which will never expire. The federal net operating loss carry forwards are limited to 80% of taxable income. The Group had a total state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $44,674, which will begin to expire after the year 2041 to 2042. The Group has a federal R&D credit of $970, which will begin to expire after the year 2041 to 2042. The Group has a California R&D credit of $680, which will never expire.\n\nUtilization of the federal and state net operating losses may be subject to certain annual limitations under IRC Section 382 due to the “change in ownership” provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. The Group has a full valuation allowance against US federal and state net operating losses.\n\nThe Group recognizes deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realized. Management reviews deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and makes estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. Realization of the Group’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Because of the Group’s lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance in the U.S. The valuation allowance increased by $6,600 and $4,495 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe Group had no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Group currently files income tax returns in the U.S., as well as California and Delaware. The Group is currently not the subject of any income tax examinations. The Group’s tax returns generally remain open for tax years after 2021.\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economy Security (CARES) Act (“the CARES Act, H.R. 748”) was signed into law on 27 March 2020. The CARES Act temporarily eliminates the 80% taxable income limitation (as enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) for NOL deductions for 2018-2020 tax years and reinstated NOL carrybacks for the 2018-2020 tax years. Moreover, the CARES Act also temporarily increases the business interest deduction limitations from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income for the 2019 and 2020 taxable year. Lastly, the Tax Act technical correction classifies qualified improvement property as 15-year recovery period, allowing the bonus depreciation deduction to be claimed for such property retroactively as if it was included in the Tax Act at the time of enactment.\n\nF-24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included a sunset provision such that Research and Experimental Expenses incurred after December 31, 2021 are capitalized and amortized. US R&E expenses are amortized over five years and non-US R&E expenses are amortized over fifteen years. As part of the December 31, 2023 tax provision calculation, the Group added back to taxable income, research expenditures of $4,848. These expenses were incurred in the U.S. and amortized over 5 years for U.S. tax purposes.\n\n**18.** Commitments and Contingencies\n\n _Commitments —_ As of December 31, 2023, the Group had other commitments of approximately $815. These commitments were solely related to contracts signed with vendors for research and development by the Group and are expected to be paid in one year.\n\n_Contingency —_ In the ordinary course of business, the Group may be subject to legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. The Group records contingent liabilities resulting from such claims, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. There was a dispute with previous landlord in 2021. On October 19, 2023, this matter was settled for $25 and the Group has timely made the payment and the matter was dismissed with prejudice. In addition, in April 2024, there was another dispute with the landlord of Folsom warehouse which the landlord seeks to recover damages in excess of $250. However, the lawsuit is in its early stage and the final outcome, including the potential amount of any losses, is uncertain. As a result, no reasonable estimate on the loss can be made as of December 31, 2023 and the Group is currently negotiating on settlement with the landlord.\n\nIn the opinion of management, there were no other material pending or threatened claims and litigation as of December 31, 2023 and through the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements.\n\n**19.** Operating Leases\n\nThe Group has operating leases for office facilities. The Group’s leases have remaining terms of more than 5 years to less than 6 years. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Group recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Business\nOverview\nPhoenix Motor Inc., doing business as “Phoenix Motorcars” through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Phoenix Cars LLC, Phoenix\nMotorcars Leasing LLC, and EdisonFuture Motor, Inc., is a leading electrification solutions provider for the commercial vehicle industry as\nwell as other industries. Phoenix designs, develops, manufactures, assembles, and integrates electric drive systems and light and medium\nduty electric vehicles (“EVs”), with an aim to reduce carbon intensity and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The Company operates two\nprimary brands, “Phoenix Motorcars” which is focused on commercial products including medium duty electric vehicles, chargers and\nelectric forklifts, and “EdisonFuture” which intends to offer light-duty electric vehicles.\nAs an EV pioneer, we launched our first medium-duty electric drivetrain in 2009 and delivered our first commercial EV in 2014. In\n2019, we launched our second generation (“Gen 2”) High Power Drive System for the Ford E450 chassis, the E-200. Since April 2021, we\nhave been in production of our third generation (“Gen 3”) drivetrain (E-300). We are currently scheduled to release our fourth generation\n(“Gen 4”) drivetrain in mid-2023, which is expected to allow for substantially higher production volumes and achieve significant cost\nreduction.\nOver the last six years we have developed and deployed for our customers all-electric shuttle buses, utility trucks, service trucks, cargo\ntrucks and flatbed trucks. This differentiates us in the market where most commercial EV manufacturers are still in the prototype phase. As\nof December 31, 2022, we have delivered a total of 116 EVs to more than 42 customers, representing what we believe is the largest number\nof Class 4 cutaway medium duty electric shuttle bus deployments in the U.S. and the most electric vehicles deployed on the Ford E-Series\nchassis. With over four million zero-emission miles accumulatively driven by the vehicles we delivered, we have gained significant industry\nexperience, distinct expertise and extensive knowledge in R&D, production, commercialization, customer engagement and validation of\nlight and medium duty EVs, enabling us to drive continued design enhancements and innovations in our current and future generations\ndrivetrain systems and other products.\nMarket Opportunity\nThe commercial EV market, which we believe is currently underserved, is projected to grow from a low base today to global sales of\nthree million units by 2025 and nine million by 2030, led by buses and light trucks, representing significant growth opportunities. Major\nfactors driving the growth of the commercial EV market are rising policy support, increasing electrification of public transport fleets,\nstringent government regulations, advancements in battery pack technologies and electric powertrains and accelerated investment in\ncharging infrastructure. By taking advantage of our proprietary technology, industry-leading experience and expertise, as well as increasing\nEV demand boosted by government incentives, grants and regulations, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the commercial\nmarket opportunities.\nProducts\nWe sell our products both fully integrated into complete vehicles and in kit form to other business partners for integration into complete\nvehicles. We are currently in production of our Gen 3 drivetrain, which includes the largest battery pack and longest range for any Class 4\nproduct on the market, offering up to 160 miles in range. We plan to start production of our Gen 4 vehicles before the third quarter of 2023,\noffering battery pack capacities of 90kWh and 150kWh with both “Buy America” and non “Buy America” options, allowing for flexibility in\npricing and configuration primarily targeting the transit bus, school bus, airport shuttle, delivery truck and work truck segments. In\nparticular, key features such as drivetrain design with batteries mounted within frame rails, energy efficient 750V architecture and fast, bi-\ndirectional charging will significantly improve vehicle safety and overall performance of our products.\nCustomers\nThe wide range of our medium-duty fleet customers include utilities, cities, municipalities, transit agencies, airports, hotels, seaports,\nschool districts, parking companies, universities, and corporate campuses, with the configurations varying from shuttle buses, Type A school\nbuses, utility trucks, service trucks, to flatbed trucks, walk-in vans, and cargo trucks.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our backlog of approximately 61 orders consists of 56 vehicles and 5 electric drive system kits. The order\nbacklog represents $12.22 million of revenue, consisting of $11.88 million for vehicles and $0.34 million for electric drive systems.\n1\nTable of Contents\nOur Strategies\nIn addressing the market opportunities, we are to:\n● Pursue an asset light strategy. We’ve been actively building and expanding strategic partnerships and alliance in R&D,\nengineering and supply chain to accelerate the development and production of our solutions. Tapping into and leveraging the\nexisting capabilities and infrastructure that our strategic partners have built, we are able to bring our solutions to market more\nquickly and cost efficiently, without the need to invest substantial amounts of capital. In addition, we are currently designing\nand executing a plan to utilize customer and third-party assembly facilities to boost production capacity with low capital\nrequirements.\n● Achieve scale. By standardizing and modularizing production and optimizing operations, we have a clear path to achieving\nsignificant scale in a cost-effective manner for our Gen 4 products and onward. The ongoing reconfiguration of our Anaheim\nfacility is to not only ramp up production, but also to serve as a training and showcase facility to ensure procedures are\nstandardized across our entire production network.\n● Secure supply of key components for production. Benefiting from strong supply chain partnerships such as the one recently\nannounced with CATL, the largest battery supplier in the world for the EV industry in terms of volume, for long term strategic\nsupply of K-Pack batteries and related products, we’re addressing the challenges and constraints that have contributed to\ndelivery delays in prior reporting periods.\n● Reduce costs. We’re shifting from a strategy of focus on low volume, high customization products to one that will allow us to\nscale quickly, based on a change of vehicle design and engineering, standardization and modularization of processes and\nprocedures and the use of standardized components and sub-assemblies. As we ramp up and further optimize supply chains\nand improve processes, we expect to substantially lower production and material costs for Gen 4 vehicles compared to that for\nGen 3 vehicles, transforming the fundamentals of the business towards sustainably higher profitability.\n● Capitalize on increasing regulatory and customer demands. We believe the commercial EV space is at a significant inflection\npoint driven by multiple tailwinds including regulations, corporate environmental mandates and state and federal grants. The\ngrowing supply chain maturity is also significantly increasing the economic attractiveness of EVs when compared with\ninternal combustion engine vehicles. We will continue to aggressively pursue the increasing demand for EV adoption.\n● Develop a purpose-built, ground-up chassis and EdisonFuture platform. The development of our fifth generation (“Gen 5”)\nproduct will enable Phoenix to be chassis independent, removing one of the major impediments facing our businesses. It’ll\nalso reduce material and production costs and allow us to customize vehicle designs to meet specialized needs, while\nmaintaining standardized processes and procedures, increasing our capacity to accommodate customer requirements and meet\nthe evolving needs of the electric vehicle market. Our EdisonFuture platform will benefit greatly from the development of\nprior generations, which will further lower costs and speed time-to-market.\nCompetition\nCompetition in the light and medium-duty truck industry is intense, as new regulatory requirements for vehicle emissions, technological\nadvances and shifting customer demands are pushing the industry towards zero-emission solutions.\nPhoenix competes with a number of commercial EV manufacturers, such as Lightning eMotors and Green Power Motor Company.\nSeveral major companies, including BYD, Ford, General Motors, Tesla and Daimler have begun entry into the commercial EV market. In\naddition, many of the aforementioned companies, along with others, such as Volvo, BYD, Hyundai, Honda, and Fiat participate in the hybrid\ncombined electric and gasoline powered vehicle business, which includes commercial vehicles that may compete with Phoenix. Most of our\ncurrent and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do. They may be\nable to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing and support of their\nelectric truck programs. Additionally, those competitors have greater name recognition, larger sales forces, broader customer and industry\nrelationships and other resources than we do.\n2\nTable of Contents\nOur Competitive Strengths\n● Demonstrated capabilities to develop and deliver commercial EVs.\n● Well-rounded management team with many years of proven industry experience in taking vehicles from concept to mass\nproduction.\n● Long and deep relationships with OEMs, customers and dealerships.\n● Long and deep relationships with strategic partners in R&D and engineering.\n● Standardized and modularized approach to product design and optimized supply chain to ramp up production and support\nexpansion quickly and in a cost-effective manner.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our vehicles to fleet customers directly and through our strategic relationships with premier commercial vehicle companies,\nincluding Matthews Specialty Vehicles, a leading manufacturer of specialty trucks and Pegasus Bus Company, a leading manufacturer of\nType A school buses.\nManufacturing and Production\nWe currently carry out the production of our EV shuttle buses and trucks from a leased facility at 1500 Lakeview Loop, Anaheim,\nCalifornia (the “Anaheim Facility”). The Anaheim Facility is leased by us at a rent of $0.4 million per year and comprises 39,043 square feet\nof space consisting of 21,000 square feet of manufacturing floor and 18,043 square feet of office space. Our Anaheim Facility will allow us\ndesign, build and test prototype vehicles and components in-house. The lease on Anaheim Facility expires in March 2027.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 60 full-time employees based primarily in the greater Anaheim, California area. A majority of our\nemployees are engaged in manufacturing functions. Our targeted hires typically have significant experience working for well-respected\noriginal equipment manufacturers, automotive engineering firms and software companies. To date, we have not experienced any work\nstoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our employees are either represented by a labor\nunion or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws\nand regulations to which we are subject govern, among others, water use; air emissions; use of recycled materials; energy sources; the\nstorage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; the protection of the environment, natural resources and\nendangered species; and the remediation of environmental contamination. We have been required to obtain and comply with the terms and\nconditions of multiple environmental permits, many of which are difficult and costly to obtain and could be subject to legal challenges.\nCompliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is an important aspect of our\nability to continue our operations.\nEnvironmental standards applicable to Phoenix are established by the laws and regulations of the state and countries in which Phoenix\noperates, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications\nand increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial civil and\ncriminal fines, penalties, and possibly orders to cease the violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works.\nIn some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses.\n3\nTable of Contents\nVehicle Safety and Testing Regulation\nOur vehicles are subject to, and comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety\nAdministration (“NHTSA”), including applicable U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards (“FMVSS”). As a manufacturer, we must self-\ncertify that the vehicles meet or are exempt from all applicable FMVSSs before a vehicle can be imported into or sold in the U.S.\nThere are numerous FMVSSs that apply to our vehicles. Examples of these requirements include:\n● Electric Vehicle Safety — limitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention and avoidance of electric shock following\nspecified crash tests;\n● Crash Tests for High-Voltage System Integrity — preventing electric shock from high voltage systems and fires that result\nfrom fuel spillage during and after motor vehicle crashes.\nIn addition to the FMVSS rules, Phoenix designs our vehicles to meet the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations of the Federal\nMotor Carrier Safety Administration, which prescribes requirements for bus and truck fleet owners. These include standards for defrosting\nand defogging systems and speedometers, as well as safety features such as steps and handholds.\nWe are also required to comply with other NHTSA requirements and federal laws administered by NHTSA, including early warning\nreporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports, foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements.\nAltoona Testing\nUnder the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (“STURAA”), federal funding of acquisition of a new\nmodel bus is unavailable unless a bus of that model has been tested for safety, structural integrity, durability, performance, maintainability,\nnoise and fuel economy. Testing is conducted at the Larson Transportation Institute’s Bus Research and Testing Center in Altoona,\nPennsylvania established for that purpose.\nVehicles that are built to Buy America compliant standards and have passed Altoona testing are eligible for FTA funding of up to 80% of\nthe capital cost of a transit vehicle. Failure to complete testing in this timeframe would materially adversely affect order fulfillment, as well\nas future sales, to customers and potential customers that require successful completion of the test program.\nEPA Emissions & Certificate of Conformity\nThe U.S. Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued\nby the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”), concerning emissions for our vehicles. A Certificate of Conformity is required for\nvehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and an Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have\nsought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. CARB sets the California standards for emissions control for\ncertain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by\nEPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles. There are currently four states which have adopted the California standard for\nheavy-duty vehicles.\nThe Greenhouse Gas Rule was incorporated into the Clean Air Act on August 9, 2011. Since our vehicles have zero-emissions, Phoenix\nis required to seek an EPA Certificate of Conformity for the Greenhouse Gas Rule, and a CARB Executive Order for the CARB Greenhouse\nGas Rule. Phoenix received the CARB Executive Order for its range of all-electric shuttle buses, trucks and school buses in November 2021\nand application for the Executive Order for the 2022 Model Year vehicles is in process.\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Credits — U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\nIn connection with the delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles under the Greenhouse Gas Rule, Phoenix will\nearn tradable credits that under current laws and regulations can be sold. Under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule, each BEV earns a credit\nmultiplier of 4.5 for use in the calculation of emission credits. Commercial vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure they meet the\nnitrogen oxide emission standard for each type of vehicle produced. This emission standard continues to lower the emission requirement\nover time, increasing the difficulty for conventional diesel vehicles to meet the standard. Until technology catches up for commercial\nvehicles, manufacturers of diesel trucks will need to purchase GHG credits to cover their emission deficit. The Greenhouse\n4\nTable of Contents\nGas Rule provides the opportunity for the sale of excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these\nregulatory requirements. Furthermore, the regulation does not limit the number of battery-electric credits sold within the same commercial\nvehicle category.\nGreenhouse Gas Credits — California Air Resources Board\nCalifornia has a greenhouse gas emissions standard which follows very closely to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standard. The\ndelivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles in California under the Greenhouse Gas Rule will earn Phoenix tradable\ncredits that can be sold. Under CARB greenhouse gas regulations, each BEV will also earn a credit multiplier of 4.5 for use in the\ncalculation of emission credits. Commercial vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure they meet the nitrogen oxide emission standard for\neach type of vehicle produced. This emission standard continues to lower the emission requirement over time, increasing the difficulty for\nconventional diesel vehicles to meet the standard.\nUntil technology catches up for commercial vehicles, manufacturers of diesel buses and trucks will need to purchase GHG credits to\ncover their emission deficit. The California timeline for reaching very low GHG emissions is more aggressive than the EPA. Commercial\nvehicle manufacturers will look to cover their emission deficits first for California. The Greenhouse Gas Rule provides an opportunity for\nthe sale of excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the\nregulation does not limit the number of battery-electric credits sold within the same commercial vehicle categories.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur results of operations have not resulted in profitability, and we may not be able to achieve profitability going forward.\nWe had accumulated deficit of $28.6 million as of December 31, 2022. We have incurred a net loss of $12.7 million and $14.6 million,\nfor the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of\nreasons, including the other risks described in this 10-K report, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications,\ndelays and other unknown events. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Our management is developing\nplans to alleviate the negative trends and conditions described above and there is no guarantee that such plans will be successfully\nimplemented. Our business plan is focused on providing sustainable and cost-effective solutions to the commercial transportation sector but\nis still unproven. There is no assurance that even if we successfully implement our business plan, that we will be able to curtail our losses or\never achieve profitable operations.\nWe have yet to achieve positive cash flow and, given our projected funding needs, our ability to generate positive cash flow is uncertain.\nWe have had negative cash flow from operating activities of $14.9 million and 12.9 million for years ended December 31, 2022, and\n2021. We anticipate that we will continue to have negative cash flow from operating and investing activities through the remainder of 2023\nas we expect to incur research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses and make capital\nexpenditures in our efforts to increase sales and ramp up operations. Our business also will at times require significant amounts of working\ncapital to support our growth. An inability to generate positive cash flow for the near term may adversely affect our ability to raise needed\ncapital for our business on reasonable terms, diminish supplier or customer willingness to enter into transactions with us, and have other\nadverse effects that may decrease our long-term viability. There can be no assurance that we will achieve positive cash flow in the near\nfuture or at all.\nOur audited financial statements included a statement that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern\nand a continuation of negative financial trends could result in our inability to continue as a going concern.\nOur audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 were prepared on the assumption that we would\ncontinue as a going concern. As a result of the continuing operating costs as we develop of our EV trucks and Gen 4 as described above, our\nmanagement has determined that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months\nand our independent auditor have included a “going concern” explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. The reaction of investors to the inclusion of a going concern statement by our independent auditors, and\nour potential inability to continue as a going concern, could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\n5\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, if our operating results fail to improve, then our financial condition could render us unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe may need to raise additional financing for the remainder of 2023, and such financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms\nor at all.\nAlthough we believe we have sufficient capital resources and capital availability to meet our needs for the remainder of 2023, we expect\nthat we will not be able to maintain the levels of capital and operating expenditures necessary to perform our current business plan, including\nlaunch and ramp of our Gen 4 products unless we generate additional cash from operations or obtain additional financing. In light of our\noperating history and the expected schedule to bring Gen 4 to market, we expect that it will be necessary to obtain additional financing,\neither through the existing SEPA equity line to issue registered shares, private placement of un-registered shares, or debt financing. We\ncannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. Recent turmoil in the capital\nmarkets, including the tightening of credit and rise of interest rates, may cause us to face higher borrowing costs, less available capital, more\nstringent terms and tighter covenants. In such circumstances, if we cannot raise additional capital, our financial condition, results of\noperations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we raise additional capital through issuances of\nequity, through the SEPA or otherwise, our stockholders could experience dilution.\nThe automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry.\nBoth the automobile industry generally, and the EV segment in particular, are highly competitive, and we will be competing for\ncustomers and sales with both EV manufacturers and traditional automotive companies. Most of our current and potential competitors may\nhave significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, or other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater\nresources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products than we may devote to our\nproducts. We expect competition for EVs to intensify due to increased demand and a regulatory push for alternative fuel vehicles. In\naddition, as fleet operators begin transitioning to EVs on a mass scale, we expect that more well-financed competitors will enter the\ncommercial fleet EV market. Further, as a result of new entrants in the commercial fleet EV market, we may experience increased\ncompetition for components and other parts of our vehicles, which may have limited or single-source supply.\nIf we are unable to successfully design, develop, manufacture and sell our Gen 4, Gen 5, EF-1 truck and EF-1 V van, our business,\nprospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. If we are able to manufacture\nand market the Gen 4, Gen 5, EF-1 truck and EF-1 V van, factors affecting competition include product performance and quality,\ntechnological innovation, customer experience, brand differentiation, product design, pricing and TCO, and manufacturing scale and\nefficiency. Increased competition will lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in downward price pressure\nand adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nPhoenix may face competition from global automotive manufacturers.\nWe compete with a number of commercial EV manufacturers, including those such as Lightning eMotors and GreenPower Motor\nCompany,. In addition to Tesla & Rivian, a number of traditional global automobile manufacturers, including Ford, General Motors,\nMercedes Benz, and Nissan-Renault- Mitsubishi-Toyota, have entered the consumer EV business, and a few, including BYD, Ford, General\nMotors, Tesla and Daimler have begun entry into the commercial EV market. These companies have far greater resources, brand recognition,\nand distribution channels than Phoenix or the Company does, which could make it difficult for Phoenix to gain widespread market\nacceptance. There can be no assurance that Phoenix will be able to compete successfully with other market participants, and, if Phoenix\ncannot, then its business could fail.\nWe will continue to require additional capital to fund our operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may not be able to\ncomplete the development and commercialization of our electric vehicles.\nThe design, manufacture and sale of electric vehicles is a capital-intensive business. Although we pursue an “asset light strategy” for\ngrowth, our business plan to design, produce, sell and service commercial electric buses, vans and trucks, including the Gen 4, Gen 5, EF-1\ntruck and EF-1 V van, is expected to require continued capital investment and incur substantial costs including research and development\nexpenses, raw material procurement costs, sales and distribution expenses as we build our brand and market our vehicles, and general and\nadministrative expenses as we scale our operations, identify and commit resources to investigate new areas of demand and incur costs as a\npublic company. Our ability to become profitable in the future will not only depend on our ability to complete the design and development\nof our vehicles but also to control our capital expenditures and costs. As we expand our product portfolio, including the scheduled release of\nGen 4 in 2023, we will need to manage costs effectively to sell those products at our expected margins. If we are unable to cost efficiently\ndesign, manufacture, market, sell and distribute and service our vehicles and provide our services, our business, prospects, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. Unlike\n6\nTable of Contents\nestablished EV automotive manufacturers that have greater financial resources than we do, there can be no assurance that we will have\naccess to the capital we need on favorable terms when required or at all. In addition, future debt financing into which we enter may impose\nupon us covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem\nour stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to significantly delay, scale back\nor discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our EV products, restrict our operations or obtain funds by entering\ninto agreements on unattractive terms, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, stock price and our relationships\nwith third parties with whom we have business relationships, at least until additional funding is obtained. If we do not have sufficient funds\nto continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that would likely result in our stockholders\nlosing some or all of their investment in us. In addition, our ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be\nsignificantly limited.\nWe may experience delays in launching and ramping up production or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs.\nWe have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp-up delays. In addition, we may introduce\nin the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products including enhancements under development\nrelating to production assembly efficiency, material component availability, cost reduction and customer feedback. There is no guarantee we\nwill be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features. We have limited experience to date in manufacturing\nelectric vehicles at low volumes. To be successful, we will need to implement, maintain, and ramp-up efficient and cost-effective\nmanufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains, high quality and output rates planned at our Anaheim manufacturing facility. We\nalso need to hire, train, and compensate skilled employees for operations. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those\nexperienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve\nmanufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or\nsustaining our vehicle production ramp-ups or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets. Any delay or other complication in\nramping up the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp-ups of our future products,\nfeatures and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nCosts of electric vehicles are high in comparison with those of traditional vehicles powered by internal combustion engines or hybrids.\nPhoenix’s EVs will not gain wide acceptance unless Phoenix can reduce manufacturing and selling costs. Prices of Phoenix EVs range\nfrom $165,000 to $225,000, whereas prices of comparable traditional combustion engine vehicles range from approximately $90,000 to\n$140,000. The cost difference is due to the incremental cost of electric drivetrain, including lithium-ion batteries, motors, inverter and\ncontrol software, coupled with the relatively low volume of production, leading to higher overheads.\nIn addition, government subsidies and incentives, including those available in California, are important for the cost-competitiveness of\nPhoenix’s EVs, and Phoenix’s growth and prospects depend in part on the availability and amounts of these subsidies and incentives. Any\nreduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and incentives because of budgetary challenges, policy\nchanges, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of electric vehicles, or other reasons may impair\nthe cost-competitiveness of Phoenix’s EVs.\nThe range of Phoenix’s existing EVs is limited, compared with that of traditional vehicles.\nWhereas traditional combustion engine medium-duty vehicles may travel from 240 to 350 miles before refueling, Phoenix’s existing\nEVs have a maximum range of 160 miles and minimum recharging time of five to six hours. Currently, Phoenix’s EVs can be charged only\nat the owner’s location or select public charging locations using compatible charging equipment, further limiting the EVs to local use.\nAccordingly, potential customers needing vehicles with longer ranges or quicker turnaround of depleted electric energy supply may find\nPhoenix’s products relatively less attractive.\nWe may experience significant delays in the design, manufacture, financing, regulatory approval, launch and delivery of our vehicles,\nwhich could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to develop, manufacture, market and sell our vehicles.\nAny delay in the financing, design, manufacture, regulatory approval, launch or delivery of our vehicles could materially damage our brand,\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could cause liquidity constraints.\n7\nTable of Contents\nVehicle manufacturers often experience delays in the design, manufacture, and commercial release of new products. To the extent we delay\nthe launch of our vehicles, our growth prospects could be adversely affected as we may fail to establish or grow our market share.\nFurthermore, we rely on third-party suppliers for the provision and development of the key components and materials used in our vehicles.\nTo the extent our suppliers experience any delays in providing us with or developing necessary components we could experience delays in\ndelivering on our timelines.\nAll of Phoenix’s current range of products are built on Ford’s E-450 chassis. A decision by Ford to offer an electric version of this\nchassis, directly, would impact the viability of Phoenix’s current products.\nPhoenix currently builds all its products on Ford’s E-450 chassis. Ford does not offer an electric version of this chassis, due to the\nrelatively small market size for medium-duty electric vehicles. As volumes increase, there is a potential risk of Ford’s launching an electric\nversion of Ford’s E-450 chassis directly from the factory, negating the need for Phoenix’s current range of products. Additionally, a shortage\nin the availability of this chassis would impact Phoenix’s capability to produce and fulfill customer’s orders in a timely manner.\nOur future growth is dependent upon the willingness of operators of commercial vehicle fleets to adopt electric vehicles and upon our\nability to produce, sell and service vehicles that meet their needs. If the market for commercial electric vehicles does not develop as we\nexpect, or if it develops slower than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be adversely\naffected.\nOur growth requires adoption of commercial vehicle operators to adopt EVs for their fleets and on our ability to produce, sell and\nservice vehicles that meet their needs. EVs’ use in the medium-duty commercial vehicle market is a relatively new development, particularly\nin the United States, and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving government regulation, industry standards, and\ncustomer views of the merits of using electric vehicles in their businesses. This process has been slow, as, without including the impact of\ngovernment or other subsidies and incentives, the purchase prices for Phoenix’s EVs currently is higher than those for diesel-fueled vehicles.\nThe relatively low price of oil has also hurt Phoenix’s over the last few years.\nPhoenix must educate fleet managers regarding the economic benefits that Phoenix believes result over the life of its EVs. Phoenix\nbelieves that these benefits depend on the following:\n● the difference in the initial purchase prices of commercial electric vehicles and vehicles with comparable gross vehicle weight\npowered by internal combustion engines or hybrids, both including the effect of government and other subsidies and incentives\ndesigned to promote the purchase of electric vehicles;\n● the total cost of ownership of the vehicle over its expected life, which includes the initial purchase price and ongoing operating\nand maintenance costs;\n● the availability and terms of financing options for purchases of vehicles and, for commercial electric vehicles, financing\noptions for battery systems;\n● the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles and future regulations\nrequiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles;\n● government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;\n● fuel prices, including volatility in the cost of diesel fuel;\n● cost and availability of other alternatives to diesel fueled vehicles, such as vehicles powered by natural gas or hybrids;\n● corporate sustainability initiatives;\n● commercial electric vehicle quality, performance and safety (particularly with respect to lithium-ion battery packs);\n● the quality and availability of service for the vehicle, including the availability of replacement parts;\n8\nTable of Contents\n● the range over which commercial electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge;\n● access to charging stations and related infrastructure costs, and standardization of electric vehicle charging systems;\n● electric grid capacity and reliability; and\n● macroeconomic factors.\nIf, in weighing these factors, operators of commercial vehicle fleets determine that there is no compelling business justification for\npurchasing commercial EVs, the market for commercial EVs may not develop as, or may develop more slowly than, Phoenix expects which\nwould adversely affect Phoenix’s business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nPhoenix has a limited number of customers, with which Phoenix does not have long-term agreements, and expects that a significant\nportion of our future sales will be from a limited number of customers. The loss of any of these customers could materially harm\nPhoenix’s business.\nA significant portion of Phoenix’s projected future revenue is expected to be generated from a limited number of customers. Phoenix\nhas no contracts with customers that include long-term commitments that ensure future sales of vehicles. The loss of or a reduction in sales\nor anticipated sales to Phoenix’s most significant customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nAn inability to attract new customers for our Gen 4 products and future generations of products will substantially impact our ability to\ngrow revenue or improve our financial results.\nOur growth will depend in large part on our ability to attract new customers. As we drive growth in our existing markets, and we\nanticipate that our sales activities will lead to additional orders and deliveries for our Gen 4 products, and, as a result, increase our base of\ncustomers. An inability to attract new customers would substantially impact our ability to grow revenue or improve our financial results.\nFurther, we often receive binding and non-binding purchase orders from customers that are contingent on various factors, such as\ncompleting a successful pilot program, obtaining third-party financing or obtaining government grants, such as HVIP. In addition, some\ncustomers are interested in future products, not yet in our production. While we continuously strive to expand our product portfolio,\ndeveloping new products takes a significant amount of time and expense, such as engineering work, sourcing new suppliers, marketing,\ntesting and quality control. In addition, orders may be delayed for a number of reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including\nsupplier delays, which may cause delays in our manufacturing process, or delays in customers obtaining financing. As a result, any such\norders may not result in actual revenue in the near term or at all. Accordingly, revenue estimates and the amount and timing of work\nexpected to be performed at the time the estimate of order backlog is developed is subject to change.\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate the supply and demand for our vehicles, which could result in a variety of inefficiencies in our\nbusiness and hinder our ability to generate revenue. If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur\nadditional costs or experience delays.\nIt is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we may have limited insight into trends that\nmay emerge and affect our business. We will be required to provide forecasts of our demand to our suppliers several months prior to the\nscheduled delivery of products to our prospective customers. If we overestimate our requirements, our suppliers may have excess inventory,\nwhich indirectly would increase our costs. If we underestimate our requirements, our suppliers may have inadequate inventory, which could\ninterrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues. In addition, lead times for materials and components\nthat our suppliers order may vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each\ncomponent at a given time. If we fail to order sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, the delivery of vehicles to our\ncustomers could be delayed, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe face various challenges in scaling manufacturing, assembling, and converting processes effectively and quickly from low volume\nproduction to high volume production for our Gen 4 drivetrain products.\nWe have no experience to date in high volume manufacturing, assembling, and converting to commercial electric vehicles. We do not\nknow whether we will be able to develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing, assembly and converting capability and processes, and reliable\nsources of component supply that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, as well as the\nproduction volumes we target. Any failure to develop such manufacturing, assembly and converting processes and capabilities and reliable\nsources of component supply within our projected costs and timelines could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,\noperating results and financial condition. Even if we are successful in developing our high-volume manufacturing, assembly\n9\nTable of Contents\nand converting capability and processes, and reliable sources of component supply, we do not know whether we will be able to do so in a\nmanner that avoids significant delays and cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers\nand vendors, or in time to meet our commercialization schedules or to satisfy the requirements of customers. In addition, certain components\nwe integrate may not be available on a consistent basis or in large quantities. Our business, prospects, financial condition and operating\nresults could be adversely affected if we experience disruptions in our supply chain or if we cannot obtain materials of sufficient quality at\nreasonable prices.\nThe complexity in our business is expected to grow as we develop new products and services. We have limited experience in\nsimultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling our electric drivetrains as well as limited experience\nallocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple electric drivetrains. As we add complexity to our product\nline and introduce new products and services, we may experience unexpected delays.\nIf we are unable to scale our existing assembly processes and systems quickly while maintaining our current quality level, including as a\nresult of supply chain constraints and inability to manage complexity in our business, we may be unable to meet our customers’ vehicle\nquality and quantity requirements or our forecasted production schedule or lower our cost of sales. As a result, we may not be able to meet\nour customers’ delivery schedules and could face the loss of customers, or be exposed to liability to customers to which we promised\ndelivery, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to scale our business operations or otherwise manage future growth effectively as we attempt to rapidly grow our company, we\nmay not be able to produce, market, service and sell our vehicles profitably or successfully.\nOur future growth depends upon our ability to maintain relationships with our existing suppliers and source suppliers for our critical\ncomponents, and to complete building out our supply chain, while effectively managing the risks due to such relationships.\nOur success will be dependent upon our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with suppliers who are critical and necessary to\nthe output and production of our vehicles. We also rely on a small group of suppliers to provide us with the components for our vehicles. The\nsupply agreements we have or may enter into with key suppliers in the future may have provisions where such agreements can be terminated\nin various circumstances, including potentially without cause. If these suppliers become unable to provide, or experience delays in\nproviding, components, or if the supply agreements we have in place are terminated, it may be difficult to find replacement components.\nChanges in business conditions, pandemics, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or that we do not presently\nanticipate could affect our ability to receive components from our suppliers.\nFurther, we have not secured supply agreements for all of our components. In addition, there is the possibility that finalizing the supply\nagreements for the parts and components of our vehicles will cause significant disruption to our operations, or such supply agreements could\nbe at costs that make it difficult for us to operate profitably.\nIf we do not enter into long-term supply agreements with guaranteed pricing for our parts or components, we may be exposed to\nfluctuations in prices of components, materials and equipment. Agreements for the purchase of battery cells typically contain pricing\nprovisions that are subject to adjustment based on changes in market prices of key commodities. Substantial increases in the prices for such\ncomponents, materials and equipment would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins, if we cannot recoup the increased\ncosts. Any attempts to increase the announced or expected prices of our vehicles in response to increased costs could be viewed negatively\nby our potential customers and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results.\nWe may be unable to adequately control the costs or maintain adequate supply of components associated with our operations.\nWe may be unable to adequately control the costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur significant costs related to\nprocuring raw materials required to manufacture and assemble our vehicles. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on\nfactors beyond our control. Our business also depends on the continued supply of battery packs for our vehicles. We are exposed to multiple\nrisks relating to availability and pricing of quality lithium-ion battery packs.\nFurthermore, currency fluctuations, tariffs or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials and other economic or political conditions\nmay result in significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or\ncomponents would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins. In addition, a growth in popularity of electric vehicles\nwithout a significant expansion in battery cell production capacity could result in shortages, which would result in increased costs in raw\nmaterials to us or impact our prospects.\n10\nTable of Contents\nDisruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could harm our business.\nHistorically, we have experienced significant delivery delays and supply shortage with our BOM components, battery packs in\nparticular. When encountered with supply disruption or shortage, our production plans and delivery schedules to our customers are to a large\nextent dictated by the timing of receiving these BOM components, or when a different supplier is fully qualified and customized into our\nproduct design. For example, COVID-19 has caused disruptions to and delays in our operations, including shortages and delays in the supply\nof certain parts, including batteries and chassis. Although we have worked diligently with our suppliers to mitigate the risks, we expect\nsupply chain delays to continue to have a significant impact on our 2023 production and revenue and possibly thereafter. Any such supply\ninterruption or shortage could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nPhoenix EVs use lithium-ion batteries, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled, have caught fire or released smoke and\nflames. Such events could result in liability under Phoenix’s warranties, for damage or injury, adverse publicity and a potential safety\nrecall, any of which would hurt Phoenix’s prospects.\nThe battery packs in Phoenix’s EVs use lithium-ion cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled can rapidly release energy\nby venting smoke and flames that can ignite nearby materials. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into\nflames have focused attention on the safety of these cells. These events also have raised questions about the suitability of lithium-ion cells\nfor automotive applications. There can be no assurance that a field failure of Phoenix’s battery packs will not occur, which would damage\nthe vehicle or lead to personal injury or death that subject Phoenix to lawsuits. Furthermore, there is some risk of electrocution if individuals\nwho attempt to repair battery packs do not follow applicable maintenance and repair protocols. Any such damage or injury would likely lead\nto adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Any such adverse publicity could adversely affect Phoenix’s business, prospects, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nIf our vehicles fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell or lease our electric vehicles could be harmed.\nIf our vehicles were to contain defects in design and/or manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair,\nour ability to develop, market and sell or lease our vehicles could be harmed. For example, the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent\non software that will require modification and updates over time. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and\nerrors when first introduced. We currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term quality, reliability and\nperformance characteristics of our buses, trucks, and other products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and repair any\ndefects in our products before commencing the sale of our vehicles. Any product defects or any other failure of our vehicles to perform as\nexpected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims or\nsignificant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and\nprospects.\nWe are relying on third-party suppliers to develop a number of advanced technologies for use in our products.\nThere can be no assurances that our suppliers will be able to meet the technological requirements, production timing and volume\nrequirements to support our business plan. In addition, the technology may not comply with the cost, performance useful life and warranty\ncharacteristics we anticipate in our business plan. As a result, our business plan could be significantly impacted and we may incur significant\nliabilities under warranty claims which could adversely affect our business, prospects and results of operations.\nWe are relying on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide us with products for our charger and material handling division.\nCurrently we are dependent entirely on third-party suppliers and partners for our chargers and material handling product lines. If these\nsuppliers are not able to provide us with products due to supply chain constrains or other reasons, we do not have the capability or\nknowledge to produce these products locally. This would result in delays in getting end products to customers and negatively impact our\nbusiness and results of operations.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOur success may be dependent on our development and protection of intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on confidentiality and trade secret protections to protect our proprietary technology. All new EV drivetrain and technical\ndevelopments by us will be owned by us. Our success will, in part, depend on our ability to obtain patents and trademarks and protect our\ntrade secrets and proprietary technology. We are currently maintaining our engineering under confidentiality agreements and other\nagreements to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary technology. Although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with\nour employees, consultants and contractors, our agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property, particularly with respect to\nconflicts of ownership relating to work product generated by our employees, consultants and contractors, and we cannot be certain that\nothers will not gain access to our trade secrets and other proprietary technology. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent\nproprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nWe may not succeed in establishing, maintaining and strengthening our brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer\nacceptance of our vehicles and components and our business, revenues and prospects.\nOur business and prospects heavily depend on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen our brand. If we are not able to establish,\nmaintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a larger base of customers. Our ability to develop, maintain and\nstrengthen our brand will depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we\nmay not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile\nmanufacturers headquartered in the United States, Japan, the European Union and China, have greater name recognition, broader customer\nrelationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong brand, our business,\nprospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur electric vehicles will compete for market share with vehicles powered by other vehicle technologies that may prove to be more\nattractive than our vehicle technologies.\nOur bus and light and medium-duty truck market currently is serviced by many manufacturers with existing customers and suppliers\nusing proven and widely accepted fuel technologies. Additionally, our competitors are working on developing technologies that may be\nintroduced in our target market. If any of these alternative technology vehicles can provide lower fuel costs, greater efficiencies, greater\nreliability or otherwise benefit from other factors resulting in an overall lower total cost of ownership, this may negatively affect the\ncommercial success of our vehicles or make our vehicles uncompetitive.\nWe may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology as new entrants and existing, larger manufacturers enter the\nelectric vehicle space.\nOur Zeus line of buses and trucks are designed for use with, and is dependent upon, existing electric vehicle technology. As new\ncompanies and larger, existing vehicle manufacturers enter the electric vehicle space, we may lose any technological advantage we may have\nhad in the marketplace and suffer a decline in our position in the market. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our products\nto continue to provide products with the latest technology. However, our products may become obsolete or our research and development\nefforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in or to create the necessary technology to effectively compete. As a result, our potential\ninability to adapt to and develop the necessary technology may harm our competitive position.\nPhoenix’s business requires highly technically skilled personnel, for whom Phoenix must compete for employment.\nPhoenix’s manufacturing and research and development require highly skilled electrical, mechanical, and software engineers.\nCompetition for employment of such individuals is intense, and Phoenix’s ability to attract and retained and retaining them is essential to\ncontinuing its business. Growth of Phoenix’s business will depend upon its ability to compete for increasing numbers of such employees,\nand there can be no assurance that Phoenix will be able to do so. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel may materially and\nadversely affect our business operations. Any failure by our management to effectively anticipate, implement and manage the changes\nrequired to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will also need to hire and train a significant number of hourly employees to expand our commercial manufacturing operations.\nFurthermore, in the event employees hired by us seek to join or form a labor union, we could be subject to risks as we engage in an attempt\nto finalize negotiations with any such union, including potential work slowdowns or stoppages, delays and increased costs. If we are\nunsuccessful in hiring and training an expanded workforce in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Liang Lance Zhou, our Chief Executive Officer.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Liang Lance Zhou, our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Zhou is the source of many, if not most,\nof the ideas and execution driving our strategies and supply chains. If Mr. Zhou were to discontinue his service to us due to death, disability\nor any other reason, we would be significantly disadvantaged.\nOur lack of effective internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to accurately report our financial results or prevent\nfraud, which may affect the market for and price of our Common Stock.\nTo implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of\nmanagement on the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 Framework). The Company has identified the following material weaknesses, in\nthe design or operation of internal controls, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report\nfinancial data: (1) failure to maintain an effective control environment of internal control over financial reporting; (2) failure to develop an\neffective risk assessment process to identify and evaluate at a sufficient level of detail all relevant risks of material misstatement, including\nbusiness, operational, and fraud risks; (3) ineffective monitoring activities to assess the operation of internal control over financial reporting;\nand (4) lack of sufficient controls designed and implemented for financial information processing and reporting and lacked resources with\nrequisite skills for the financial reporting under U.S. GAAP.\nWe will be subject to the requirement that we maintain internal controls and that management perform periodic evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the internal controls. Effective internal control over financial reporting is important to prevent fraud. As a result, our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the market for and trading price of our shares of Common Stock,\nmay be materially and adversely affected if we do not have effective internal controls. Before becoming a public company, we were a private\ncompany with limited resources. As a result, we may not discover any problems in a timely manner and current and potential shareholders\ncould lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our shares of Common Stock. The\nabsence of internal controls over financial reporting may inhibit investors from purchasing our shares and may make it more difficult for us\nto raise funds in a debt or equity financing.\nWe intend to implement measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to address the underlying causes of\nthese material weaknesses, including (1) hiring more qualified staff and increasing resources with sufficient knowledge and experience to\nstrengthen financial reporting; (2) setting up a financial and system control framework to ensure proper segregation of duty and review\nprocedures, with formal documentation of polices and controls in place; (3) forming a task force to design and improve processes and\ncontrols to monitor operations and record financial data; and (4) devoting proper time by senior management to perform comprehensive\nreview of procedures to assess risks and enforce effective accountability.\nIn addition, we anticipate that the process of building and improving our accounting and financial functions and infrastructure will\nrequire significant additional professional fees, internal costs and management efforts. We expect that we will need to implement a new\ninternal system to enhance the management of our financial, accounting, human resources and other functions. However, such a system\nwould likely require us to complete many processes and procedures for the effective use of the system or to run our business using the\nsystem, which may result in substantial costs. Any disruptions or difficulties in implementing or using such a system could adversely affect\nour controls and harm our business. Moreover, such disruption or difficulties could result in unanticipated costs and diversion of\nmanagement’s attention.\nAdditional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may be identified in the future. If we identify such issues or if we are unable\nto produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may decline and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the\nNasdaq Listing Rules.\n13\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our securities may fluctuate and may decline.\nFluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. The trading price of our securities\nhas been volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors\nlisted below could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our securities.\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to\nbe similar to us;\n● changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results;\n● success or failure of competitors;\n● our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n● changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the market in general;\n● operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n● operating and stock price performance of SPI Energy, our majority shareholder;\n● our ability to market new and enhanced services and products on a timely basis;\n● changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n● commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n● changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n● the volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\n● short selling of our common stock or other securities;\n● any announced or anticipated stock or equity linked instrument offering by us;\n● any major change in the board of directors or management;\n● sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception\nthat such sales could occur; and\n● general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and\nacts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The\nstock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating\nperformance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be\npredictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for automotive stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to\nbe similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. A decline in\nthe market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional\nfinancing in the future.\n14\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements as set forth in the Nasdaq listing rules, our common\nstock could be delisted from the Nasdaq, and if this were to occur, then the price and liquidity of our common stock, and our ability to\nraise additional capital, may be adversely affected.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq. Continued listing of a security on the Nasdaq is\nconditioned upon compliance with certain continued listing requirements and continued listing standards set forth in the Nasdaq listing rules,\nincluding a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. There can be no assurance we will continue to satisfy the all the requirements for\nmaintaining a Nasdaq listing.\nDelisting of our common stock could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock because alternatives, such as the OTC Bulletin\nBoard and the pink sheets, are generally considered to be less efficient markets. An investor likely would find it less convenient to sell, or to\nobtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy our common stock on an over-the-counter market. Many investors likely would not buy or sell\nour common stock due to difficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a\nnational exchange or other reasons. A delisting of our common stock would likely to have an adverse impact on our stock price, inhibit or\npreclude our ability to rise additional financing, effect strategic acquisitions and may also materially and adversely impact our credit terms\nwith our vendors.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets by our existing stockholders, or the perception that such sales\nmight occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or\nthe market perceives that we or our stockholders intend to sell, a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, the market\nprice of our common stock could decline significantly.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our share incentive\nplans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nOur Second Amended to the Amended Certificate of Incorporate authorizes us to issue up to 450,000,000 shares of our common stock\nand up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. We may issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock from time to time\nin connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plans or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial\ndilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, holders of\nour common stock may need to rely on sales of their shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any\nfuture gains on their investment.\nIt is not possible to predict the actual number of shares we will sell under the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the “SEPA”), or the\nactual gross proceeds resulting from those sales. Further, we may not have access to the full amount available under the SEPA.\nOn November 22, 2022, we entered into the SEPA with YA II PN, Ltd. (“Yorkville”), pursuant to which Yorkville has committed to\npurchase up to $10,000,000 of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA. We have the right to\ncontrol the timing and amount of any sales of our shares of common stock to Yorkville under the SEPA.\nAlthough the SEPA provides that we may sell up to an aggregate of $10,000,000 of our common stock to Yorkville, only 4,035,086\nshares of our common stock, including the aggregate amount of 61,421 Commitment Shares issued to Yorkville, have been registered. If we\nelect to sell to the Yorkville all of the 4,035,086 registered shares of common stock, depending on the market price of our common stock\nprior to each Advance made pursuant to the SEPA, the actual gross proceeds from the sale of all such shares may be substantially less than\nthe $10,000,000 available to us, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity.\n15\nTable of Contents\nIf it becomes necessary for us to issue and sell to Yorkville under the SEPA more than the 4,035,086 shares registered for resale in order\nto receive aggregate gross proceeds equal to $10,000,000, we must file with the SEC one or more additional registration statements to\nregister under the Securities Act the resale by Yorkville of any such additional shares of our common stock we wish to sell from time to time\nunder the SEPA, which the SEC must declare effective. Additionally, we would need to obtain stockholder approval to issue shares of\ncommon stock in excess of the Exchange Cap under the SEPA in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules, unless all applicable sales of\nshares of common stock under the SEPA equal or exceed the “Minimum Price” (as such term is defined in the Nasdaq Rules) or, as to any\nAdvance, the issuance of the common stock pursuant to an Advance Notice would be excluded from the Exchange Cap under Nasdaq rules\n(or interpretive guidance provided by the Nasdaq with respect thereto), in which case, under applicable Nasdaq rules, the Exchange Cap\nlimitation would not apply to issuances and sales of common stock under the SEPA. Any issuance and sale by us under the SEPA of shares\nof common stock in addition to the 4,035,086 shares of common stock registered for resale by Yorkville could cause additional dilution to\nour stockholders.\nWe are not required or permitted to issue any shares of common stock under the SEPA if such issuance would breach our obligations\nunder the rules or regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. In addition, Yorkville will not be required to purchase any shares of our\ncommon stock if such sale would result in their beneficial ownership exceeding 9.99% of the then issued and outstanding common stock.\nOur inability to access a part or all of the amount available under the SEPA, in the absence of any other financing sources, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nIf we elect to draw down amounts under the SEPA, which will result in the sale of shares of our common stock to Yorkville, any such\ndraw-downs may have a dilutive impact on our existing shareholders. Though we have been advised by Yorkville, and Yorkville represents\nin the SEPA, that Yorkville is purchasing the shares for its own account, for investment purposes, and without any view or intention to\ndistribute such shares in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, Yorkville may resell some or all of the shares\nwe issue to it pursuant to draw-downs under the SEPA and such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Relating to Regulation and Claims\nProduct liability or other claims could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe risk of product liability claims, product recalls and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the manufacturing, marketing and sale\nof all vehicles, including electric vehicles. Although we have liability insurance policies in place, that insurance may be inadequate to cover\nall potential product claims. Any product recall or lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside\nof our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional liability\ninsurance coverage on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed or at all. A successful product liability claim against us could\nrequire us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product recall could generate substantial negative publicity about our products\nand business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future product candidates. We cannot provide assurance that such claims\nand/or recalls will not be made in the future.\nRegulatory requirements may have a negative effect upon our business.\nAll vehicles sold must comply with international, federal and state motor vehicle safety standards. In the United States, vehicles that\nmeet or exceed all federally mandated safety standards are certified under the federal regulations. Rigorous testing and the use of approved\nmaterials and equipment are among the requirements for achieving federal certification. Our Zeus buses and trucks are subject to substantial\nregulation under federal, state and local laws and standards. These regulations include those promulgated by the U.S. EPA, the National\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) and various\nstate boards, and compliance certification is required for each new model year. These laws and standards are subject to change from time to\ntime and we could become subject to additional regulations in the future. In addition, federal, state and local laws and industrial standards\nfor electric vehicles are still developing. Compliance with these regulations could be challenging, burdensome, time consuming and\nexpensive. If compliance results in delays or substantial expenses, our business could be adversely affected.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nAny reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes,\nthe reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the electric vehicle industry or other reasons may result in\nthe diminished competitiveness of the electric vehicle industry generally. This could materially and adversely affect the growth of our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWhile certain tax credits and other incentives for alternative energy production and electric vehicles have been available in the past,\nthere is no guarantee these programs will be available in the future. If current tax incentives are not available in the future, our financial\nposition could be harmed. As federal, state, or local legislation related to electric vehicles or data protection continues to develop, we will\nlikely be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our products, protective measures and internal\nprocesses to comply with such legislation.\nWe may be exposed to liability for infringing upon other companies’ intellectual property rights.\nOur success, in part, is dependent on our ability to operate without infringing on others’ proprietary rights. While we are not aware of\nany patents and trademarks which would cause our products or their use to infringe the rights of any third parties, we cannot be certain that\ninfringement has not or will not occur. We could incur substantial costs, in addition to a great amount of time lost, in defending any patent or\ntrademark infringement suits or in asserting any patent or trademark rights in a suit with another party.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in building\nour manufacturing facilities.\nOur operations are and will continue to be subject to international, federal, state, and/or local environmental laws and regulations,\nincluding laws relating to water use; air emissions; use of recycled materials; energy sources; the protection of human health and the\nenvironment, natural resources and endangered species; and the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials.\nEnvironmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex, and we expect that we will be affected by future\namendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws and regulations which may require us to change our\noperations, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. We have\nbeen required to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits, certificates, or registrations, many of\nwhich are difficult and costly to obtain and could be subject to legal challenges. Violations of these laws, regulations, and permits,\ncertificates and registrations can give rise to liability for administrative oversight and correction costs, cleanup costs, property damage,\nbodily injury and fines and penalties. In some cases, violations may result in suspension or revocation of permits, certificates or\nregistrations. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations\nmay result in substantial fines and penalties, third party damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations, and reputational\nharm.\nContamination at properties we currently own or operate, will own or operate, we formerly owned or operated or to which hazardous\nsubstances were sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which can impose liability for the full amount of remediation-\nrelated costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for vapor intrusion and other\nexposure pathways or impacts to human health or the environment and for damages to natural resources. The costs of complying with\nenvironmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We may face unexpected delays in obtaining the required\npermits and approvals in connection with our planned production facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and\ndelay our ability to operate these facilities, which would adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n17\nTable of Contents\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, or any litigation that we may be subject to or\ninvolved in may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and the Nasdaq Stock Market on\nwhich we are applying for our securities to be listed. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq and other legal\nand regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming\nand costly.\nThose laws, regulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws,\nregulations or rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, operating\nresults, reputation and financial condition.\nAny product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, prospects,\noperating results and financial condition. In the future, we may, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our electric vehicles or\ncomponents (including our battery packs) prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards.\nSuch recalls, whether caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, would involve significant\nexpense and diversion of management’s attention and other resources, which could adversely affect our brand image in our target market and\nour business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not have adequate insurance coverage for possible claims, lawsuits, product recalls or other damages claims made against us.\nThe successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to\nour insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an\nadverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on\nacceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. As a recently public company with limited operating\nhistory we may find it difficult to obtain and maintain certain categories of insurance such as adequate D&O insurance, product liability\ninsurance, garage keepers insurance, cybersecurity insurance, etc.\nInsufficient warranty reserves to cover future warranty claims could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results.\nOur EVs are sold with warranties, and as a result we need to maintain warranty reserves to cover any warranty-related claims. If our\nwarranty reserves are inadequate to cover such future warranty claims, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results\ncould be materially and adversely affected. We may become subject to significant and unexpected warranty expenses. There can be no\nassurances that then-existing warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEconomic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nUncertain global economic conditions, in particular in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business. Negative\nglobal economic trends, such as decreased consumer and business spending, high unemployment levels and declining consumer and\nbusiness confidence, pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flow. Although we\ncontinue to devote significant resources to support our brands, unfavorable economic conditions may negatively affect demand for our\nproducts.\n18\nTable of Contents\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability\nmaterial to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are\nrequired. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse\npublicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are\nvalid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. Since inception, the Company has not been a party to any material litigation.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. If a cyber security incident occurs, we could suffer information theft, data corruption, operational\ndisruption and our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur customers, and our industry generally, have become more dependent on digital and connected technologies to conduct business. We\ndepend on digital and connected technologies to monitor our EVs, perform many of our services and to process and record financial and\noperating data, among other things. We also expect to increase our dependence on these technologies as we expand our offerings. Ensuring\nthe secure and reliable processing, maintenance and transmission of this data is important to our operations and our customers. As cyber\nsecurity incidents (including deliberate attacks) have increased in number, scope, and sophistication, energy assets (and related networks)\nmay become the targets of more incidents. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our customers, vendors, suppliers and other\nbusiness partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the loss or destruction of\nproprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, while we depend on certain business partners to\nstore certain information regarding our customers and employees, these third parties may be a target of cyberattacks or information security\nbreaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, or misuse of sensitive information. Our recourse against these\nbusiness partners, if any, may be limited. In addition, we, our customers, vendors, and/or business partners may be unable to detect certain\nbreaches (such as unauthorized surveillance) for an extended period of time. Our systems and controls for protecting against cyber security\nrisks, and those used by our business partners, may be insufficient. The loss, misuse, destruction, unauthorized release, gathering, or\nmonitoring of sensitive information result in significant financial losses, loss of customers and business opportunities, reputation damage,\nlitigation (including any damages awarded), regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, or\notherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We will likely be required to expend additional\nresources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber security\nincidents. The reliability and capacity of our systems is critical to our operations. Any difficulties in implementing or integrating new\nsystems or enhancing current systems, or any material disruption in our information technology systems or systems could have an adverse\neffect on our business and results of operations.\nPhishing scams could compromise sensitive data, harm our reputation, and lead to financial losses.\nPhishing scams involve malicious actors attempting to trick our employees into providing sensitive information or accessing malicious\nlinks, often through fraudulent emails or websites. If our employees fall victim to these scams, it could result in financial losses, damage to\nour brand reputation, and compromise of confidential or proprietary information. Despite implementing preventative measures and\nemployee training, the risk of phishing scam remains, and a successful attack could cause disruption and have significant negative financial\nimpact to our business.\nWe face risks related to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and any other conflicts that may arise on a global or regional scale\nwhich could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOn February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation launched an invasion of Ukraine that has had an immediate impact on the global\neconomy resulting in higher energy prices and higher prices for certain raw materials and goods and services which in turn is contributing to\nhigher inflation in the United States and other countries across the globe with significant disruption to financial markets and supply and\ndistribution chains for certain raw materials and goods and services on an unprecedented scale. The impact of the sanctions has also included\ndisruptions to financial markets, an inability to complete financial or banking transactions, restrictions on travel and an inability to service\nexisting or new customers in a timely manner in the affected areas of Europe. The Russian Federation could resort to cyberattacks and other\naction that impact businesses across the United States, the European Union and other nations across the globe including those without any\ndirect business ties to the Russian Federation. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has continued to escalate without any resolution of the\ninvasion foreseeable in the near future with the short and long-term impact on financial and business conditions in Europe remaining highly\nuncertain.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe U.S. and the European Union responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by imposing various economic sanctions on the Russian\nFederation to which the Russian Federation has responded in kind. The United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Australia and other countries\nacross the globe have imposed their own sanctions on the Russian Federation. The United States, the European Union and such other\ncountries acting together or separately could impose wider sanctions or take further actions against the Russian Federation if the conflict\ncontinues to escalate. Multinational corporations and other corporations and businesses with business and financial ties to the Russian\nFederation have either reduced or eliminated their ties to the Russian Federation in a manner that often exceeds what is required pursuant to\nsanctions by these countries. While we do not have any direct business or financial ties to the Russian Federation or Ukraine as part of our\nown business, the impact of higher energy prices and higher prices for certain raw materials and goods and services resulting in higher\ninflation and disruptions to financial markets and disruptions to manufacturing and supply and distribution chains for certain raw materials\nand goods and services across the globe may impact our business in the future. We will assess and respond where appropriate to any direct\nor indirect impact that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has on the availability or pricing of the raw materials for our products, manufacturing\nand supply and distribution chains for our products and on the pricing and demand for our products.\nIn addition, any deterioration in credit markets resulting directly or indirectly from the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine could limit\nour ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. Adverse economic conditions may also result in a\nhigher rate of losses on accounts receivables that we accrue in the future due to credit defaults. As a result, a downturn in the worldwide\neconomy resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and other conflicts with a global impact that may arise from time to time could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and/or financial condition.\n20\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1 B.

This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a\nresult of various factors, including those set forth under “Item 1A.— Risk Factors” or in other parts of this annual report on Form 10-K.\n22\nTable of Contents\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (“GAAP”). Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates\nthat involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have critical accounting estimates in the areas of accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-lived\nassets and goodwill, and product warranties.\nPrincipal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nWe believe that the following factors have had, and we expect that they will continue to have, a significant effect on the development of\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\n● COVID-19 Impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has created and continues to create various global macroeconomic, customer\ndemand, operational and supply chain risks, any one of which could have an adverse impact on our business going\nforward. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we experienced supply chain constraints and inflationary\npressures, and expect some of those constraints and pressures to continue into 2023. We have been actively taking measures\nintended to manage both supply chain constraints and higher raw materials costs through such measures as supplier\ndiversification, ongoing operational efficiency efforts and quotation adjustments to mitigate the impact on our business. We\nalso continue to see more challenges in attracting and retaining labor.\n● BOM and Supply Chain Challenges. Purchased materials represent the largest component of cost of goods sold in our\nproducts and we continue to explore ways to improve cost structure of our products through better design, strategic alliances\nfor sourcing, supply chain optimization, and, in some cases vertical integration. We believe that an increase in volume and\nadditional experience as well as long term and strengthened supply chain partnerships will allow us to continue to reduce our\nBill of Materials (“BOM”), labor and overhead costs, as a percentage of total revenue. By reducing material costs, driving\nimprovement in battery performance, increasing facility utilization rates and achieving better economies of scale, we can\nreduce prices while maintaining or growing gross margins of our products to further lower customers’ total cost of ownership\n(“TCO”) and help accelerate commercial electric vehicle adoption. Because we rely on third party suppliers for the\ndevelopment, manufacture, and development of many of the key components and materials used in our vehicles, we have been\naffected by industry-wide challenges such as significant delivery delays and supply shortages of certain BOM components.\nWhile we continue to focus on mitigating risks to our operations and supply chain in the current industry environment, we\nexpect that these industry-wide trends will continue to affect our ability and the ability of our suppliers to obtain parts and\ncomponents on a timely basis for the foreseeable future, having a significant impact on our business and results of operations\nin 2023 and possibly thereafter.\n● Availability of Funding to Develop Products and Scale Production. Our results are impacted by our ability to sell our\nelectrification solutions and services to new and existing customers. We have had initial success with selling to our fleet\ncustomers. In order to sell additional products to new and existing customers, we will require substantial additional capital to\ndevelop our products and services, ramp up production and support expansion. Although we pursue an asset light strategy, we\nexpect that both our capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as\nwe continue to invest in our technology, research and development efforts, obtain, maintain and improve our operational,\nfinancial and management information systems, hire additional personnel, obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual\nproperty portfolio. Until we can generate sufficient revenue from vehicle sales, we expect to primarily finance our operations\nthrough proceeds from public or private stock offering, debt financings including but not limited to term loans, revolving line\nof credit and equity linked instruments, and potentially federal and state incentive funding programs. The amount and timing\nof our future funding requirements, will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our research and\ndevelopment efforts , the lead time for various components in our supply chain, and our ability to successfully manage and\ncontrol costs and scale our operations.\n23\nTable of Contents\n● Government Subsidies and Incentive Policies. With growing emphasis on improving air quality around our communities,\nlarge states like California are mandating key end user segments to switch to zero emission transportation options. Some of the\nkey regulations driving growth in our addressable market include:\n● requiring all transit buses in California to be zero emissions by 2040;\n● requiring all airport shuttles in California to be all electric by 2035,\n● requiring at least 50% of all medium-duty trucks sold in California to electric by 2030,\n● requiring specific end user segments like drayage and yard trucks to go electric.\nOther states like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts are also expected to bring in regulatory requirements for key end user\nsegments like, transit agencies and school buses to switch to all electric transportation options. Fifteen other states including\nConnecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,\nRhode Island, Vermont, and Washington have committed to follow California’s Advanced Clean Trucks Regulation. Primarily\ndriven by the urgent need to meet carbon and greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, various state and federal agencies are also\nsupporting the switch to zero emission transportation, providing a host of funding and incentive support to develop, demonstrate\nand deploy zero emission transportation solutions. Some of the key funding / incentives driving adoption of electric medium duty\nvehicles include:\n● the California Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project, which offers a minimum of $60,000\nper vehicle as incentive for Class 4 electric vehicles registered and operating in the state;\n● the New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program offering up to $100,000 per Class 4 electric vehicle;\n● funding from federal agencies like the Federal Transit Administration, covering up to 80% of the cost of procuring electric\ntransit buses and various funding options covering up to 100% of the cost of procuring all electric school buses across key\nstates.\n● Federal and various state agencies have established incentives for setting up both public and private charging\ninfrastructure. Notably, the California Energy Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission have approved\nfunding up to 100% of the cost of setting up chargers and related infrastructure. Large utilities like Southern California\nEdison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric have ‘Charge Ready’ programs that cover the entire cost of\nsetting up charging infrastructure. Other states like New York, Chicago, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Ohio have\nalso introduced programs to support fleets with their charging infrastructure requirements.\n24\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nNet Revenues\nThe Year Ended\nIn thousands December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nNet revenues $ 4,330 $ 2,977\nCost of revenues 3,510 3,540\nGross profit (loss) 820 (563)\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative 13,970 13,750\nOperating loss (13,150) (14,313)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense, net (7) (3)\nOthers 461 (287)\nTotal other income (expense), net 454 (290)\nLoss before income taxes (12,696) (14,603)\nIncome tax provision (9) (11)\nNet loss $ (12,705) $ (14,614)\nNet loss per share of common stock:\nBasic and Diluted $ (0.65) $ (0.84)\nWeighted average common stocks outstanding 19,664,273 17,500,000\nNet Revenues\nOur revenues were primarily derived from sale and lease of EVs, sales of forklifts and other revenue. Other revenue consists of\nengineering and maintenance service, sales of component and charging stations, shipping and delivery fees and others.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our revenues were $4.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The 45.4% increase in\nrevenues was primarily driven by the increase in sales of all-electric lithium-ion forklifts. Our revenue breakdown by major categories is as\nfollows:\nYear ended Year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nSales of EVs $ 1,789 $ 1,750\nLease of EVs 551 586\nSales of forklifts 1,251 —\nOthers 739 641\n$ 4,330 $ 2,977\nDespite strong demand for our EVs as indicated by our sales backlog, supply chain disruptions and constraints that impacted our results\nin the year ended December 31, 2021, relating to primarily shortage of battery packs and Ford E-450 chassis, continued to limit the number\nof EVs we could produce throughout the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, a software related issue resulted in the delay in\ndelivery of EVs during the third quarter of the year.\nWe receive grants from government agencies related to sales and leases of EVs, and sales of chargers. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of governmental grant recognized as revenue from sales of EVs and chargers was $895 and\n$1,243, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of governmental grant recognized as reductions of the\ncost of sales for EV leasing was $214 and $252, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balances of government grants\nreceived were included in deferred income with amount of $503 and $714, respectively.\nCost of Revenues\nOur costs of revenue consist primarily of direct parts, material and labor costs, as well as shipping and delivery and other costs.\n25\nTable of Contents\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our costs of revenue were $3.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively. The cost of\nrevenues was unchanged from a year ago, due to a change in product mix reflecting significantly lower costs for EVs partially offset by the\ninclusion of the cost for electric forklift products.\nGross Margin\nGross profit is defined as revenues minus cost of revenues. Gross margin, stated as a percentage, is defined as the gross profit divided\nby the revenues.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our combined gross margin rose from -18.9% to 18.9%, driven by higher margins\nacross all products categories, primarily attributable to a significantly improved margin of EVs from -30.6% to 4.9% and the 18.9% margin\nof electric forklifts.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of selling, general, administrative expenses.\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses which consist primarily of salaries, research and development, professional service\nfees, rent expense, and office supplies expenses.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our operating expenses were $14.0 million and $13.8 million, respectively. The\nincrease in operating expenses is mainly due to the increase in salaries and wages, and costs related to being a public company, partially\noffset by a decrease in research and development cost. The increase in salaries and wages is driven by an increase in headcount from 55 to\n60 to beef up capacity in engineering, production and service, and prepare for an expected production expansion. The decrease in research\nand development cost reflects our change of approach to product development in alignment with our “asset light strategy” where we\noutsource a significant portion of design and engineering work for Gen 4 product to third party vendors and partners.\nOther (Expenses) Income, net\nOther (expenses) income, net includes interest expense and other income (expenses), net.\nInterest Expense, net\nOur interest expense, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $7 thousand and $3 thousand, respectively.\nOther income (expense)\nOur other income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $0.5 million, primarily due to forgiveness of PPP loan and employee\nretention credit, partially offset by a loss related to a phishing scam.\nOur other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $0.3 million, primarily due to loss on disposal of property and equipment.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the above factors, our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $12.7 million, and $14.6 million,\nrespectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the\nfinancial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Out of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 3 —\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this registration statement,\ncertain accounting policies are deemed “critical,” as they require management’s highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions.\nWhile management believes its judgments, estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based on information presently available and\nactual results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\n26\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets and Goodwill\nThe Group’s long-lived assets include property and equipment and other intangible assets with finite lives. The Group evaluates long-\nlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nrecoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Group first compare\nundiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-\nlived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying\namount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted\nmarket values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Any impairment write-downs would be treated as permanent\nreductions in the carrying amounts of the assets and a charge to operations would be recognized.\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment as of December 31 every year by either performing a qualitative assessment or a\nquantitative test. The qualitative impairment assessment is an assessment of historical information and relevant events and circumstances to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The\nCompany may elect not to perform the qualitative impairment assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. The quantitative\ngoodwill impairment test compares the fair values of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. A reporting unit\nconstitutes a business for which discrete profit and loss financial information is available. In performing the quantitative impairment test, the\nCompany may determine the fair values of its reporting unit using a combination of the income and market approach. If the fair value of\neach reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit\nexceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill\nallocated to that reporting unit. Following the completion of our IPO, our stock price and associated market capitalization are also\nconsidered in the determination of reporting unit fair value.\nThe judgments and estimates involved in identifying and quantifying the impairment of long-lived assets or goodwill involve inherent\nuncertainties, and the measurement of the fair value is dependent on the accuracy of the assumptions used in making the estimates and how\nthose estimates compare to our future operating performance.\nThe Company tested goodwill for impairment as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 by performing a qualitative assessment test and no\nimpairment indicator was noted. The Group evaluates long-lived assets for impairment and did not note events or changes in circumstances\nthat indicate the carrying amount of the asset groups may not be recoverable. As a result, no impairments were recorded during the years\nended December 31, 2022 and 2021, for goodwill and long-lived assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur accounting practices under ASC Topic 606 are as follows:\nSales of EVs and kits\nWe generated revenue from sales of EVs and kits. We also generate revenue from sales of electric drive system kits that are integrated\ninto shuttle buses sold to the customers. EV buyers in California are entitled to government grants when they purchase EV that qualify for\ncertain government grant project. We applied for and collected such government grants on behalf of the customers. Accordingly, customers\nonly pay the amount after deducting government grants.\nWe recognize revenue on sale of EVs and kits at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which\ntypically occurs upon the delivery to the customer. We determined that the government grants should be considered as part of the transaction\nprice because it is granted to the EV buyer and the buyer remains liable for such amount in the event the grants were not received by us or\nreturned due to the buyer violates the government grant terms and conditions.\nLease of EVs\nEV leasing revenue included revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for direct leasing programs. We accounted for these\nleasing transactions as operating leases under ASC 842 Leases, and revenues were recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual\nterm.\n27\nTable of Contents\nSales of forklifts\nRevenue on sale of forklifts is recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which\ntypically occurs upon delivery or acceptance of the customer depending on the terms of the underlying contracts.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue consists of maintenance service, sales of component and charging stations, shipping and delivery fees and other. For\nengineering and maintenance service, revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term. For sales of component and\ncharging stations, shipping and delivery fees and other, the Group recognizes revenue at a point in time following the transfer of control of\nsuch products or service to the customer, which typically occurs upon the delivery to the customer.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventories is determined on the basis of first in first out\nmethod. The cost of finished vehicles or kits comprises direct materials, direct labor and an appropriate proportion of overhead. The cost of\nforklifts comprises purchase price paid to the manufacturer, tariff and shipping costs. Net realizable value is based on estimated selling\nprices less selling expenses and any further costs expected to be incurred for completion. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to net\nrealizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances are included in the cost of revenue in the\nconsolidates statement of operations. These adjustments are based on assumptions about expected demand and market conditions. Our\nassumption of expected demand is developed based on our analysis of sales backlog, market forecast, and competitive intelligence. Our\nassumption of expected demand is compared to available inventory, production capacity, available third-party inventory, and growth plans.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, nil and $493 of inventories were written down to reflect the lower of cost or net\nrealizable value, respectively.\nAccounts Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Group grants open credit terms to credit-worthy customers. Accounts receivable are primarily related to sales of EV and EV\ncomponents. The Group maintains allowances for doubtful accounts. The Group adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments — Credit Losses\nusing the modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit from January 1, 2020. Management\nused an expected credit loss model for the impairment of trading receivables as of period ends. Management believes the aging of accounts\nreceivable is a reasonable parameter to estimate expected credit loss, and determines expected credit losses for accounts receivables using an\naging schedule as of period ends. The expected credit loss rates under each aging schedule were developed on basis of the average historical\nloss rates from previous years, and adjusted to reflect the effects of those differences in current conditions and forecasted changes.\nManagement measured the expected credit losses of accounts receivable on a collective basis. When an accounts receivable does not share\nrisk characteristics with other accounts receivables, management will evaluate such accounts receivable for expected credit loss on an\nindividual basis. Doubtful accounts balances are written off and deducted from allowance, when receivable are deemed uncollectible, after\nall collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. No provision for doubtful accounts was\nrecorded for the year ended December 31, 2022. Bad debt expense was $100, including $95 of accounts receivable write-off, for the year\nended December 31, 2021.\nProduct Warranties\nThe Group provides warranties on all vehicles or components sold in addition to pass through warranties from third party component\nsuppliers. The Group accrues a warranty reserve for the products sold by the Group, which includes the Group’s best estimate of the\nprojected costs to repair or replace items under warranties. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the\nnature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given the Group’s relatively short history of sales, and\nchanges to the Group’s historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The\nGroup considers the warranty provided is not providing incremental service to customers rather an assurance to the quality of the vehicle,\nand therefore is not a separate performance obligation and should be accounted for in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees. Warranty\nexpense is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\n28\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax\nconsequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their\nrespective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates\nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation\nallowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe recognize in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being\nsustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-\nnot recognition threshold, management presumes that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full\nknowledge of all relevant information. In addition, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to\ndetermine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit\nthat is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. Our tax liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted\nperiodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of the tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation.\nSuch adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. We record interest and penalties related to an uncertain\ntax position, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. No reserve for uncertain tax\npositions was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We do not expect that the assessment regarding unrecognized tax\npositions will materially change over the next 12 months. We are not currently under examination by an income tax authority, nor have been\nnotified that an examination is contemplated.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued\nor adopted accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Group has incurred a net loss of $12.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, and the cash used in the operating\nactivities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $14.9 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Group had a working capital balance of\n$2.9 million. Our current and historical operating cash flows, current cash and working capital balances, and forecasted working capital\nrequirements were considered in connection with our evaluation of our ongoing liquidity. The Group’s operating results and capital\nrequirements for future periods depend on many factors, including the growth and scaling of the Group’s manufacturing operations, the\ntiming and extent of spending to support development efforts for products and services, the timing of new product introductions, the\ncontinuing market acceptance of the Group’s products and services, and the expansion of the Group’s sales and marketing teams. Until the\nGroup can generate sufficient cash flow from operations, the Group expect to fund its operations through a combination of equity offerings,\ndebt financings or other capital markets transactions, while diligently executing on collaborations and strategic initiatives to optimize use of\navailable fundings.\nFor the next 12 months from the issuance date of this consolidated interim financial statements, the Group plans to continue\nimplementing various measures to boost revenue and control the cost and expenses within an acceptable level. Such measures include: 1)\nalign capacity with demand and prioritize production for high margin products in the Group’s order backlog; 2) expand and strengthen\nstrategic partnership to outsource a significant portion of design and engineering work for next generation product to third party vendors and\nsuppliers to control overall development costs; 3) negotiate better payment terms with customers and for some of the new orders, require\ndown payments; 4) implement comprehensive budget control and reduce operating expenses; and 5) calibrate capital allocation to manage\nliquidity and drive near-term goals without compromising long-term growth; 6) continue to proactively implement a robust capital market\nstrategy to provide financing for our operations through proceeds from public or private stock offering, debt financings including but not\nlimited to term loans, revolving line of credit and equity linked instruments, and potentially federal and state incentive funding programs.\n29\nTable of Contents\nA summary of the cash flow activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\n2022 2021\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (14,866) $ (12,939)\nNet cash used in investing activities (1,011) (638)\nNet cash generated from financing activities 13,583 561\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents (2,294) (13,016)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of (i) net loss of\n$12.7 million, adjusted by non-cash items of depreciation and amortization of $1.6 million, forgiveness of PPP loan of $0.6 million,\namortization of right-of-use assets of $0.8 million, and stock-based compensation expenses of 1.0 million, and changes in operating assets\nand liabilities including (i) an increase in inventories of $2.5 million, (ii) an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.0 million,\n(iii) an increase in accounts receivable of $0.3 million, (iv) a decrease in lease liability of $0.6 million, and (v) a decrease in accounts\npayable of $0.4 million; partially offset by (i) an increase in advance from customer of $0.4 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities operating activities was $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result\nof (i) net loss of $14.6 million, adjusted by non-cash items of depreciation and amortization of $1.7 million, noncash write-down on\ninventory of $0.5 million, and noncash loss on disposition of property and equipment of 0.3 million, (ii) increase in inventories of $1.4\nmillion, (iii) decrease in deferred income of $0.5 million, and (iv) decrease in warranty reserve of $0.2 million; partially offset by (i) increase\nin prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.3 million, (ii) increase in accounts payable of $0.4 million, and (iii) increase in accrued liabilities\nof $0.3 million.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was $1.0 million, primarily as a result of capital expenditure\nof $1.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from disposal of property and equipment of $0.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $0.7 million, primarily as a result of capital\nexpenditure.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash generated from financing activities was $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as result of net IPO\nproceeds of $13.4 million and proceeds from exercise of employee stock options of $0.1 million.\nNet cash generated from financing activities was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as result of net proceeds\nfrom PPP loan of $0.6 million and repayment of other long-term borrowing of $0.03 million.\nTrend information\nOur operating results substantially depend on revenues derived from our sales and leasing of EVs. Other than as disclosed elsewhere in\nthis prospectus, the following trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments, or events for 2022 are reasonably likely to have a material effect\non our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported consolidated financial information not\nnecessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial conditions:\n● Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The $370\nbillion allocated to climate and clean energy investments dramatically expands tax credits and incentives to deploy more clean\nvehicles, including commercial vehicles, while supporting a domestic EV supply chain and charging infrastructure buildout.\nIRA transportation sector provisions will accelerate the shift to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by combining consumer and\nmanufacturing policies. The IRA extends the existing tax credit for electric vehicles and establishes a new tax credit for used\nelectric vehicles, as well as establishes a new tax credit for commercial ZEVs. Under the IRA, commercial ZEVs will be\neligible for a federal tax credit of up to the lesser of 30% of the sales price or the incremental cost of a comparable ICE-engine\nvehicle, capped at $7,500 for vehicles under 14,000 pounds and $40,000 for all others. In addition, governmental entities may\nalso be eligible to claim these credits. Vehicles’ final assembly must be in North\n30\nTable of Contents\nAmerica to be eligible for the federal tax credit, but commercial vehicles are exempt from the battery or mineral sourcing\nrequirements that apply to consumer electric vehicles. The federal tax credit on charging equipment has been extended through\n2032. For commercial uses, the tax credit is 6% with a maximum credit of $100,000 per unit. The equipment must be placed in\na low-income community or non-urban area. The IRS has yet to release further guidance on specific aspects of the\naforementioned credits. The announcement of the IRA and the delay in receiving IRS guidance as to the roll-out of the new tax\ncredits has reduced the number of customer orders during the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, as many\nexisting or potential customers are waiting to place orders until they are certain of the amount of tax credits available per ZEV.\nIn addition, many customers are evaluating the size and type of ZEV they intend to purchase because the amount of the tax\ncredit depends on the weight of the vehicle, among other factors. Furthermore, other government programs, such as the FTA's\nLow- and No-Emission Vehicle Program or certain state programs, recently announced new funding and are in the process of\nmaking these funds available for eligible purchases. Until these processes are established, we believe, customer orders may be\ndelayed.\n● Supply-chain challenges. We have experienced significant delivery delays from our suppliers from beginning of the COVID-\n19 pandemic through most of 2022. In addition, we often do not get informed of delivery delays until or after the expected\ndelivery dates and have, at times, also experienced deliveries in advance of expected delivery dates without prior notice (for\norders that were previously delayed), which does not allow for adequate planning. We have also experienced shortages of\nchassis and other components. As a result of these planning challenges, we have increased our inventory of raw materials and\ncritical components, such as chassis, batteries or motors, and added new suppliers to optimize cost, minimize supply chain\nissues and prepare for an increase in future production. However, adding new suppliers, especially for chassis, increases\nrequirements for working capital and places us at the mercy of price volatility. We expect supply chain challenges will\ncontinue for the foreseeable future.\n● Inflation and interest rates. We are experiencing cost increases due to inflation resulting from various supply chain disruptions\nand other disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and general global economic conditions. The cost of raw materials,\nmanufacturing equipment, labor and shipping and transportation has increased considerably. We expect higher than recent\nyears’ levels of inflation to persist for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to fully offset higher costs through price\nincreases or other measures, we could experience an adverse impact to our business, prospects, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows. Interest rates have also increased considerably. The increase in inflation and interest rates impacts\nthe demand for our EVs, as customers may delay purchasing and/or have difficulty financing their purchases.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPhoenix has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its\nfinancial condition or results of operations that are material to stockholders.\nITEM 7A.

Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not\neffective because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as discussed below.\nNotwithstanding this material weakness, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for each of the fiscal years presented\nherein in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in\nRules 13a-15(f) and 5d-15(f) under the Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2022. The framework used by management in making the\nassessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, our management has determined that as of December 31,\n2022, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the purpose for which it is intended and determine there\nto be a material weakness.\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as\nrequired by Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404(a). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the\nsupervision of the Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer and effected by the Company’s Board of\nDirectors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted\naccounting principles.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-\n15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Because of its\ninherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projection of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree\nof compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected\non a timely basis. In connection with management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022:\n(1) Failure to maintain an effective control environment of internal control over financial reporting;\n(2) Failure to develop an effective risk assessment process to identify and evaluate at a sufficient level of detail all relevant risks of\nmaterial misstatement, including business, operational, and fraud risks;\n(3) Ineffective monitoring activities to assess the operation of internal control over financial reporting;\n(4) Lack of sufficient controls designed and implemented for financial information processing and reporting and lacked resources with\nrequisite skills for the financial reporting under U.S. GAAP.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRemediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe intend to implement measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to address the underlying causes of\nthese material weaknesses, including (1) hiring more qualified staff and increasing resources with sufficient knowledge and experience to\nstrengthen financial reporting; (2) setting up a financial and system control framework to ensure proper segregation of duty and review\nprocedures, with formal documentation of polices and controls in place; (3) forming a task force to design and improve processes and\ncontrols to monitor operations and record financial data; and (4) devoting proper time by senior management to perform comprehensive\nreview of procedures to assess risks and enforce effective accountability.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year\nended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nITEM 9B.

The Board of Directors has determined that John F. Perkowski, Steven E. Stivers ,\nSam Van and Zhenxing Fu are independent under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Rules.\nA director is not required to hold any shares in the Company by way of qualification. A director who is in any way, whether directly or\nindirectly, interested in a contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction with our company must declare the nature of his interest\nat a meeting of the directors. Subject to the NASDAQ Rules and disqualification by the chairman of the relevant board meeting, a director\nmay vote in respect of any contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction notwithstanding that he or she may be interested\ntherein and if he or she does so his or her vote shall be counted and he or she may be counted in the quorum at the relevant board meeting at\nwhich such contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction is considered. Our board of directors may exercise all of the powers of\nour Company to borrow money, to mortgage or charge our undertakings, property and uncalled capital, and to issue debentures or other\nsecurities whenever money is borrowed or pledged as security for any debt, liability or obligation of our Company or of any third party.\nBoard Operations\nOne person holds the positions of principal executive officer and chairman of the Board of Company. The Board has not designated a\nlead director. Given the limited number of directors comprising the Board, the independent directors call and plan their executive sessions\ncollaboratively and, between board meetings, communicate with management and one another directly. In the circumstances, the directors\nbelieve that formalizing in a lead director functions in which they all participate might detract from rather than enhance performance of their\nresponsibilities as directors. The Chairman of the Board chairs Board and stockholder meetings and participates in preparing their agendas.\nThe Chairman of the Board also serves as a focal point for communication between management and the Board between Board meetings,\nalthough there is no restriction on communication between directors and management. The Company believes that these arrangements afford\nthe directors sufficient resources to supervise management effectively, without being overly engaged in day-to-day operations.\nThe Board plays an active role, as well as the independent committees, in overseeing the management of the Company’s risks. The\nBoard regularly reviews reports from members of senior management and committees on areas of material risk to the Company, including\noperational, financial, legal, strategic and regulatory risks.\nThe Board of Directors held 3 meetings during 2022. During 2022, no director attended fewer than 75% of the meetings of the Board of\nDirectors and Board committees of which the director was a member.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nWe have an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, comprised solely of\nindependent directors.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee consists of John F.

The audit committee is responsible for, among other things:\n● appointing the independent auditors and pre-approving any non-audit services to be performed by the independent auditors;\n● reviewing and approving all proposed related-party transactions;\n● reviewing with the independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and management’s response;\n● discussing the audited financial statements with management and the independent auditors;\n● reviewing major issues as to the adequacy of our internal controls and any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in\ninternal controls;\n● meeting separately and periodically with management and the independent auditors;\n● reviewing with the general counsel the adequacy of procedures to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory responsibilities; and\n● reporting regularly to the entire board of directors.\nThe Audit Committee held 3 meetings during 2022.\nDuties of Directors\nOur directors owe to us fiduciary duties, including a duty of loyalty, a duty to act honestly and a duty to act in what they consider in\ngood faith to be in our best interests. Our directors also have a duty to exercise the skill they actually possess and such care and diligence\nthat a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. In fulfilling their duty of care to us, our directors must ensure\ncompliance with our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time. Our Company has the right to\nseek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached.\nTerms of Directors and Executive Officers\nThe members of the Board serve until their successors are duly elected and have qualified. Our officers are appointed by and serve at\nthe discretion of the board of directors. A director will cease to be a director if, among other things, the director (i) becomes bankrupt or\nmakes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; (ii) dies or is found by our company to be or becomes of unsound mind;\n(iii) resigns his office by written notice to the Company; (iv) the board resolves that his office be vacated; or (v) is removed from office\npursuant to any other provision of our memorandum and articles of association.\nMaterial Changes to the Procedures by which Security Holders May Recommend Nominees to the Board\nWe do not currently have a procedure by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Board.\n37\nTable of Contents\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of a\nregistered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOfficers, directors and ten percent shareholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. We\nbelieve that, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, all filing requirements Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nwere not applicable to our officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners.\nCode of Ethics\nOur board of directors believes in strict adherence to the highest standards of business ethics and responsibility. We have thus adopted a\ncode of business conduct and ethics that applies to us and our directors, officers, employees and advisors. Certain provisions of the code\napply specifically to our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, senior operating officer and any other persons who perform similar\nfunctions for us. We have filed this code of business conduct and ethics as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K.

The\n2021 Plan is a comprehensive incentive compensation plan under which we can grant equity-based and other incentive awards to our\nofficers, employees, directors, consultants and advisers. The purpose of the 2021 Plan is to help us attract, motivate and retain such persons\nwith awards under the 2021 Plan and thereby enhance shareholder value.\nAdministration. The 2021 Plan is administered by the board, and upon consummation of this offering will be administered by a\ncommittee of the board, which shall consist of two of more members of the board, each of whom is a “non-employee director” within the\nmeaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and independent” for purposes of any applicable listing requirements. Among\nother things, the committee has complete discretion, subject to the express limits of the 2021 Plan, to determine the directors, employees and\nnonemployee consultants to be granted an award, the type of award to be granted the terms and conditions of the award, the form of payment\nto be made and/or the number of shares of common stock subject to each award, the exercise price of each option and base price of each\nstock appreciation right (“SAR”), the term of each award, the vesting schedule for an award, whether to accelerate vesting, the value of the\ncommon stock underlying the award, and the required withholding, if any. The compensation committee may amend, modify or terminate\nany outstanding award, provided that the participant’s consent to such action is required if the action would impair the participant’s rights or\nentitlements with respect to that award. The compensation committee is also authorized to construe the award agreements, and may\nprescribe rules relating to the 2021 Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the compensation committee does not have any authority to grant or\nmodify an award under the 2021 Plan with terms or conditions that would cause the grant, vesting or exercise thereof to be considered\nnonqualified “deferred compensation” subject to Code Section 409A.\nGrant of Awards; Shares Available for Awards. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, SARs, performance share awards,\nperformance unit awards, distribution equivalent right awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and unrestricted stock\nawards to non-employee directors, officers, employees and nonemployee consultants of Phoenix or its affiliates. The aggregate number of\nshares of common stock that may be issued under the 2021 Plan shall be equal to ten percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding shares of\ncommon stock on a fully diluted basis. Shares shall be deemed to have been issued under the 2021 Plan solely to the extent actually issued\nand delivered pursuant to an award. If any award expires, is cancelled, or terminates unexercised or is forfeited, the number of shares subject\nthereto is again available for grant under the 2021 Plan.\n40\nTable of Contents\nStock Options. The 2021 Plan provides for either “incentive stock options” (“ISOs”), which are intended to meet the requirements for\nspecial federal income tax treatment under the Code, or “nonqualified stock options” (“NQSOs”). Stock options may be granted on such\nterms and conditions as the compensation committee may determine; provided, however, that the per share exercise price under a stock\noption may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant and the term of the stock option may not\nexceed 10 years (110% of such value and five years in the case of an ISO granted to an employee who owns (or is deemed to own) more\nthan 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of capital stock of our Company or a parent or subsidiary of our Company). ISOs\nmay only be granted to employees. In addition, the aggregate fair market value of common stock covered by one or more ISOs (determined\nat the time of grant), which are exercisable for the first time by an employee during any calendar year may not exceed 100,000. Any excess\nis treated as a NQSO.\nStock Appreciation Rights. A SAR entitles the participant, upon exercise, to receive an amount, in cash or stock or a combination\nthereof, equal to the increase in the fair market value of the underlying common stock between the date of grant and the date of exercise.\nSARs may be granted in tandem with, or independently of, stock options granted under the 2021 Plan. A SAR granted in tandem with a\nstock option (i) is exercisable only at such times, and to the extent, that the related stock option is exercisable in accordance with the\nprocedure for exercise of the related stock option; (ii) terminates upon termination or exercise of the related stock option (likewise, the\ncommon stock option granted in tandem with a SAR terminates upon exercise of the SAR); (iii) is transferable only with the related stock\noption; and (iv) if the related stock option is an ISO, may be exercised only when the value of the stock subject to the stock option exceeds\nthe exercise price of the stock option. A SAR that is not granted in tandem with a stock option is exercisable at such times as the\ncompensation committee may specify.\nPerformance Shares and Performance Unit Awards. Performance share and performance unit awards entitle the participant to receive\ncash or shares of common stock upon the attainment of specified performance goals. In the case of performance units, the right to acquire\nthe units is denominated in cash values.\nDistribution Equivalent Right Awards. A distribution equivalent right award entitles the participant to receive bookkeeping credits, cash\npayments and/or common stock distributions equal in amount to the distributions that would have been made to the participant had the\nparticipant held a specified number of shares of common stock during the period the participant held the distribution equivalent right. A\ndistribution equivalent right may be awarded as a component of another award under the 2021 Plan, where, if so awarded, such distribution\nequivalent right will expire or be forfeited by the participant under the same conditions as under such other award.\nRestricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards. A restricted stock award is a grant or sale of common stock to the\nparticipant, subject to our right to repurchase all or part of the shares at their purchase price (or to require forfeiture of such shares if issued\nto the participant at no cost) in the event that conditions specified by the compensation committee in the award are not satisfied prior to the\nend of the time period during which the shares subject to the award may be repurchased by or forfeited to us. Our restricted stock unit\nentitles the participant to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of a share of common stock for each restricted stock unit\nsubject to such restricted stock unit award, if the participant satisfies the applicable vesting requirement.\nUnrestricted Stock Awards. An unrestricted stock award is a grant or sale of shares of our common stock to the participant that is not\nsubject to transfer, forfeiture or other restrictions, in consideration for past services rendered to Phoenix or an affiliate or for other valid\nconsideration.\nChange-in-Control Provisions. In connection with the grant of an award, the compensation committee may provide that, in the event of\na change in control, such award will become fully vested and immediately exercisable.\nAmendment and Termination. The compensation committee may adopt, amend and rescind rules relating to the administration of the\n2021 Plan, and amend, suspend or terminate the 2021 Plan, but no such amendment or termination will be made that materially and\nadversely impairs the rights of any participant with respect to any award received thereby under the 2021 Plan without the participant’s\nconsent, other than amendments that are necessary to permit the granting of awards in compliance with applicable laws. We have attempted\nto structure the 2021 Plan so that remuneration attributable to stock options and other awards will not be subject to the deduction limitation\ncontained in Code Section 162(m).\nITEM 12.

The loan is due on\ndemand and bears no interest. The Group used a portion of the IPO proceeds to repay the $1.7 million related party loans in 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Group paid $0.1 million withholding payroll taxes on behalf of SPI, and this amount due\nfrom related party was fully repaid to the Group as of December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Group sold forklifts in amount of $0.2 million to SolarJuice Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of\nSPI.

Transactions involving compensation for services provided to us as an employee, director, consultant or similar capacity by a\nrelated person are not covered. A related party is any executive officer, director or a holder of more than five percent of our shares of\ncommon stock, including any of their immediate family members and any entity owned or controlled by such persons.\nUnder our policy, where a transaction has been identified as a related party transaction, management must present information regarding\nthe proposed related party transaction to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors for review. The presentation must include a\ndescription of, among other things, the material facts, the direct and indirect interests of the related parties, the benefits of the transaction to\nus and whether any alternative transactions are available. To identify related party transactions in advance, we rely on information supplied\nby our executive officers, directors and certain significant shareholders. In considering related party transactions, the Audit Committee of\nour Board of Directors takes into account the relevant available facts and circumstances including, but not limited to the risks, costs and\nbenefits to us; the impact on a director’s independence in the event the related person is a director, immediate family member of a director or\nan entity with which a director is affiliated; the terms of the transaction; the availability of other sources for comparable services or products;\nand the terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties or to or from our employees generally. In the event a director\nhas an interest in the proposed transaction, the director must excuse himself or herself from the deliberations and approval.\nDirector Independence\nThe Board has determined that John F. Perkowski , Steven E. Stiver, Sam Van and Zhenxing Fu are “independent” under the current\nindependence standards of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC and meet the criteria set forth in\nRule 10A(m)(3) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nITEM 14.

Our Board asks our independent registered\npublic accounting firm to provide a detailed description of its services each year as a basis for its decision-making. The Board evaluates the\nproposals based on four categories: audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and other services; and determines the proper\narrangement for each service according to its judgment as to our needs over the coming year. Our Board pre-approves all audit and non-audit\nservices to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. The Board pre-approved 100% of the audit and audit-related\nservices performed by the independent registered public accounting firms described above in fiscal years 2020 and 2021.\n43\nTable of Contents\nPre-Approval of Services\nIn accordance with the SEC’s auditor independence rules, the Audit Committee has established the following policies and procedures by\nwhich it approves in advance any audit or permissible non-audit services to be provided to the Company by its independent auditor.\nPrior to the engagement of the independent auditor for any fiscal year’s audit, management submits to the Audit Committee for approval\nlists of recurring audit, audit-related, tax and other services expected to be provided by the auditor during that fiscal year. The Audit\nCommittee adopts pre-approval schedules describing the recurring services that it has pre-approved, and is informed on a timely basis, and\nin any event by the next scheduled meeting, of any such services rendered by the independent auditor and the related fees.\nThe fees for any services listed in a pre-approval schedule are budgeted, and the Audit Committee requires the independent auditor and\nmanagement to report actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year. The Audit Committee will require additional pre-\napproval if circumstances arise where it becomes necessary to engage the independent auditor for additional services above the amount of\nfees originally pre-approved. Any audit or non-audit service not listed in a pre-approval schedule must be separately pre-approved by the\nAudit Committee on a case-by-case basis. Every request to adopt or amend a pre-approval schedule or to provide services that are not listed\nin a pre-approval schedule must include a statement by the independent auditors as to whether, in their view, the request is consistent with\nthe SEC’s rules on auditor independence.\nThe Audit Committee will not grant approval for:\n● any services prohibited by applicable law or by any rule or regulation of the SEC or other regulatory body applicable to the\nCompany;\n● provision by the independent auditor to the Company of strategic consulting services of the type typically provided by\nmanagement consulting firms; or\n● the retention of the independent auditor in connection with a transaction initially recommended by the independent auditor, the\ntax treatment of which may not be clear under the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations and which it is reasonable to\nconclude will be subject to audit procedures during an audit of the Company’s financial statements.\nTax services proposed to be provided by the auditor to any director, officer or employee of the Company who is in an accounting role or\nfinancial reporting oversight role must be approved by the Audit Committee on a case-by-case basis where such services are to be paid for\nby the Company, and the Audit Committee will be informed of any services to be provided to such individuals that are not to be paid for by\nthe Company.\nIn determining whether to grant pre-approval of any non-audit services in the “all other” category, the Audit Committee will consider all\nrelevant facts and circumstances, including the following four basic guidelines:\n● whether the service creates a mutual or conflicting interest between the auditor and the Company;\n● whether the service places the auditor in the position of auditing his or her own work;\n● whether the service results in the auditor acting as management or an employee of the Company; and\n● whether the service places the auditor in a position of being an advocate for the Company.\n44\nTable of Contents\nPART IV\nITEM 15 Exhibits, Financial Statements and Schedules\n(a) 1.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in\nthe period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the\nfinancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph — Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going\nconcern. As more fully described in Note 2, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from operating\nactivities, and needs to raise additional funds to sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s\nability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated\nfinancial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As\npart of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such\nopinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\nWe believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum Asia CPAs LLP\nMarcum Asia CPAs LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nNew York, New York\nMarch 31,

Description of Business and Organization\nDescription of Business\nPhoenix Motor Inc. (“Phoenix Motor” or the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”) is engaged in design, assembly,\nand integration of electric drive systems for medium duty electric vehicles (“EVs”).\nPhoenix Cars, LLC (“PCL”), a subsidiary of Phoenix Motor, designs and manufactures zero- emission electric drivetrain systems for\nintegration in medium to heavy-duty commercial fleet vehicles in United States. PCL also sells a range of material handling products\nincluding all-electric lithium-ion forklifts and pallet jacks. Phoenix Motorcars Leasing, LLC (“PML”), a subsidiary of Phoenix Motor, serves\nas a sales and leasing dealership for PCL in United States.\nPhoenix Motor was incorporated in the state of Delaware in October 2020. EdisonFuture, Inc., a subsidiary of SPI Energy Co., Ltd\n(“SPI”), is the parent company of Phoenix Motor. On November 12, 2020, EdisonFuture, Inc. acquired 100% of the membership interest of\nPCL and PML. Simultaneously, EdisonFuture, Inc. effected the transfer of 100% membership interests of PCL and PML to Phoenix Motor.\nOn June 8, 2022, the Company sold 2,100,000 shares of its common stock in its IPO, at an offering price of $7.5 per share. The\nCompany received net proceeds of $13,438 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\n2. Going Concern\nThe Group had recurring losses from operations. The Group has incurred a net loss of $12,705 during the year ended December 31,\n2022, and the cash flow used in operating activities was $14,866. The Group has incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from\noperating activities, and needs to raise additional funds to sustain its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Group’s\nability to continue as a going concern.\nFor the next 12 months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements, the Group plans to continue implementing\nvarious measures to boost revenue and control the cost and expenses within an acceptable level. Such measures include: 1) align capacity\nwith demand and prioritize production for high margin products in the Group’s order backlog; 2) expand and strengthen strategic partnership\nto outsource a significant portion of design and engineering work for next generation product to third party vendors and suppliers to control\noverall development costs; 3) negotiate better payment terms with customers and for some of the new orders, require down payments; 4)\nimplement comprehensive budget control and reduce operating expenses; and 5) calibrate capital allocation to manage liquidity and drive\nnear-term goals without compromising long-term growth; 6) continue to proactively implement a robust capital market strategy to provide\nfinancing for our operations through proceeds from public or private stock offering, debt financings including but not limited to term loans,\nrevolving line of credit and equity linked instruments, and potentially federal and state incentive funding programs.\nThere is no assurance that the plans will be successfully implemented. If the Group fails to achieve these goals, the Group may\nneed additional financing to repay debt obligations and execute its business plan, and the Group may not be able to obtain the necessary\nadditional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that financing sources are not available, or that the Group is\nunsuccessful in increasing its gross profit margin and reducing operating losses, the Group may be unable to implement its current plans for\nexpansion, repay debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations and may materially adversely affect its ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded\nassets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should the Group be unable to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nF-7\nTable of Contents\n3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\n(b) Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization\nof assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the\nnormal course of business are dependent on, among other things, the Group’s ability to operate profitably, to generate cash flows from\noperations, and to pursue financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\n(c) Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial\nstatements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful\naccounts, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, and warranty reserves. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised\nestimates. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in those estimates and assumptions.\n(d) Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Group measures at fair value certain of its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities by using a fair value hierarchy that\nprioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid\nto transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially an exit price, based on the\nhighest and best use of the asset or liability. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n● Level 1 — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n● Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs (e.g., quoted prices for similar items in active markets, quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar items in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rate and yield\ncurves, and market-corroborated inputs).\n● Level 3 — Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting unit to develop its own\nassumptions.\nThe Group uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value when available. If quoted market prices are not available, the Group\nmeasures fair value using valuation techniques that use, when possible, current market-based or independently-sourced market parameters,\nsuch as interest rates.\nThe carrying values of the Group’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses\nand other current assets, accounts payables, accrued liabilities and advance from customers, approximate their fair values due to the short-\nterm nature of these instruments.\n(f) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash accounts, interest bearing savings accounts and all highly liquid investments with\noriginal maturities of three months or less, which are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use. There were no cash equivalents as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\n(g) Accounts Receivable, net\nThe Group grants open credit terms to credit-worthy customers. Accounts receivable are primarily related to sales of EV, EV\ncomponents and electric forklifts. The Group maintains allowances for doubtful accounts. The Group adopted ASC 326 Financial\nInstruments — Credit Losses using the modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit from\nJanuary 1, 2020. Management used an expected credit loss model for the impairment of trading receivables as of period ends. Management\nbelieves the aging of accounts receivable is a reasonable parameter to estimate expected credit loss, and determines expected credit losses\nfor accounts receivables using an aging schedule as of period ends. The expected credit loss rates under each aging schedule were developed\non basis of the average historical loss rates from previous years, and adjusted to reflect the effects of those differences in current conditions\nand forecasted changes. Management measured the expected credit losses of accounts receivable on a collective basis. When an accounts\nreceivable does not share risk characteristics with other accounts receivables, management will evaluate such accounts receivable for\nexpected credit loss on an individual basis. Doubtful accounts balances are written off and deducted from allowance, when receivables are\ndeemed uncollectible, after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\n(h) Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventories is determined on the basis of first in first out\nmethod. The cost of finished vehicles or kits comprises direct materials, direct labor and an appropriate proportion of overhead. The cost of\nforklifts comprises purchase price paid to the manufacturer, tariff and shipping costs. Net realizable value is based on estimated selling\nprices less selling expenses and any further costs expected to be incurred for completion. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to net\nrealizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances and are included in the cost of revenue in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n(i) Property and Equipment, net\nThe Group accounts for its property and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Cost includes the\nprices paid to acquire or construct the assets and any expenditure that substantially extends the useful life of an existing asset. The Group\nexpenses repair and maintenance costs when they are incurred. Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method based on the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets as follows:\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years\nAutomobile 3 to 7 years\nLeased automobile 3 years\nThe shorter of the estimated life or the lease\nLeasehold improvements term\n(j) Intangible Assets other than Goodwill, net\nIntangible assets consist of technology, tradename and others. Amortization is recorded on the straight-line method based on the\nestimated useful lives of the assets.\n(k) Impairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Group’s long-lived assets include property and equipment, intangible assets with finite lives and right-of-use assets. The Group\nevaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may\nnot be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Group first compares\nundiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group from their use and their eventual disposition to its carrying\namount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is\nrecognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques\nincluding discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Any\nimpairment write-downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amounts of the assets and a charge to operations would be\nrecognized. There is no impairment loss recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nF-9\nTable of Contents\n(l) Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired entity as a result of the Group’s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries. Goodwill is not\namortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be\nimpaired.\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment as of December 31 every year by either performing a qualitative assessment or a\nquantitative test. The qualitative impairment assessment is an assessment of historical information and relevant events and circumstances to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The\nCompany may elect not to perform the qualitative impairment assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. The quantitative\ngoodwill impairment test compares the fair values of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. A reporting unit\nconstitutes a business for which discrete profit and loss financial information is available. In performing the quantitative impairment test, the\nCompany may determine the fair values of its reporting unit using a combination of the income and market approach. If the fair value of\neach reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit\nexceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill\nallocated to that reporting unit. There is no impairment loss recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(n) Income Taxes\nThe Group accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the\nfuture tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and\ntheir respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax\nrates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The\neffect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A\nvaluation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Group recognizes in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of\nbeing sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-\nlikely-than-not recognition threshold, management presumes that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has\nfull knowledge of all relevant information. In addition, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured\nto determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit\nthat is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The Group’s tax liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is\nadjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of the tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging\nlegislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. The Group records interest and penalties\nrelated to an uncertain tax position, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. No\nreserve for uncertain tax positions was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Group does not expect that the\nassessment regarding unrecognized tax positions will materially change over the next 12 months. The Group is not currently under\nexamination by an income tax authority, nor have been notified that an examination is contemplated.\n(o) Revenue Recognition\nThe Group’s accounting practices under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 606, “Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers” (“ASC 606” or “Topic 606”) are as followings:\nSales of EVs and kits\nThe Group generates revenue from sales of EVs and kits. EV buyers in California are entitled to government grants when they purchase\nEV that qualify for certain government grant project. The Group applies for and collect such government grants on behalf of the customers.\nAccordingly, customers only pay the amount after deducting government grants.\nThe Group recognizes revenue on sales of EVs and kits at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the\ncustomer, which typically occurs upon the delivery to the customer. The Group determined that the government grants should be\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nconsidered as part of the transaction price because it is granted to the EV buyer and the buyer remains liable for such amount in the event the\ngrants were not received by the Group or returned due to the buyer violates the government grant terms and conditions.\nLease of EVs\nEV leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for direct leasing programs. The Group accounts for\nthese leasing transactions as operating leases under ASC 842 Leases, and revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the\ncontractual term.\nSales of forklifts\nRevenue on sale of forklifts is recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which\ntypically occurs upon delivery or acceptance of the customer depending on the terms of the underlying contracts.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue consists of maintenance service, sales of component and charging stations, shipping and delivery fees and others. For\nmaintenance service, revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term. For sales of component and charging\nstations, shipping and delivery fees and others, the Group recognizes revenue at a point in time following the transfer of control of such\nproducts or services to the customer, which typically occurs upon the delivery to the customer.\nDisaggregation of revenues\nThe Group disaggregates its revenue by four primary categories: sales of EVs, lease of EVs, sales of forklifts and others.\nThe following is a summary of the Group’s disaggregated revenues:\nYear ended Year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nSales of EVs $ 1,789 $ 1,750\nLease of EVs 551 586\nSales of forklifts 1,251 —\nOthers 739 641\n$ 4,330 $ 2,977\nA contract liability is the Group’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration\n(or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balances of contract liability were\nincluded in advance from customer with amount of $1,230 and $803, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nGroup recognized $803 and $709 as revenue that was included in the balance of advance from customers at January 1, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\n(p) Cost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for EV and kits sales includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overheads, shipping and logistics\ncosts, and inventories write-down. Cost of revenues for EV leasing primarily includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles over the\nlease term and other leasing related charges including vehicle insurance. Cost of revenues from forklift sales primarily includes purchase\nprice paid to manufacturer, tariff, as well as shipping and delivery costs. Cost of other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs,\nas well as shipping and delivery and other costs.\n(q) Segment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of a Group which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly\nby the operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Group’s chief operating decision\nmaker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Lance Liang Zhou. Based on the financial information presented to and reviewed by the\nCODM, the Group has determined that it had a single operating and reporting segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\n(r) Product Warranties\nThe Group provides warranties on all vehicles or components sold in addition to pass through warranties from third party component\nsuppliers. The Group accrues a warranty reserve for the products sold by the Group, which includes the Group’s best estimate of the\nprojected costs to repair or replace items under warranties. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the\nnature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given the Group’s relatively short history of sales, and\nchanges to the Group’s historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The\nGroup considers the warranty provided is not providing incremental service to customers rather an assurance to the quality of the vehicle,\nand therefore is not a separate performance obligation and should be accounted for in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees. Warranty\nexpense is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The balance of warranty reserves was $325\nand $360 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(s) Government Grant\nThe Group receives grants from government agencies related to sales and leases of its EVs. The government grants related to the sales\nof EVs should be considered as part of the transaction price because it is granted to the EV buyers and the Group receives such on behalf of\nthe buyers to settle part of the EVs purchase price. The government grant received before the Group’s delivery of the EVs are recorded as\ndeferred income and recognized as revenue when the EVs are delivered to the buyers, for the government grants the Group is entitled upon\ndelivery of the EVs to buyers but not yet received, the Group records accounts receivable. For government grants associated with leased\nvehicles under operating leases, the grants are recorded in deferred income when received and are recognized to reduce the cost of sales\nduring useful life of leased vehicles.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of governmental grant recognized as revenue from sales of EVs and\nchargers was $895 and $1,243, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of governmental grant recognized as reductions of the cost of sales for\nEV leasing was $214 and $252, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balances of government grants received were included in deferred income with amount of $503\nand $714, respectively.\n(t) Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Group granted employees and directors stock-based incentive awards. These awards are in the form of options and unrestricted\nstock units. The Group measures stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted based on the estimated fair value of\nthose awards on their grant date and expenses over the period on a straight-line basis during which an employee is required to provide\nservice in exchange for the award (the vesting period). As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of\noperations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are required to be\nestimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\n(u) Earnings (loss) per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of common stock by the weighted\naverage common stocks outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss)\nattributable to shareholders of common stock by the weighted average common stocks outstanding during the period adjusted for the effect\nof dilutive share of common stock equivalent (computed using the treasury stock or if converted method). Potential common stocks that\nhave an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted\nearnings (loss) per share. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, nil and 1,050,000 potentially dilutive shares are excluded\nfrom the computation as their effects are anti-dilutive, respectively.\n(v) Leases\nThe Group adopted Leases (ASC Topic 842), using the modified retrospective transition method effective January 1, 2022. The\nGroup categorizes leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance lease. The Group has no finance\nleases for any of the periods presented.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nRight-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Group’s rights to use underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities represent\nthe Group’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease\npayments at the lease commencement date and ROU assets are recognized at amount of lease liabilities and any prepaid lease payments. The\ninterest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is the Group’s incremental borrowing rate because the interest\nrate implicit in the leases is not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a\ncollateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. The lease terms\ninclude periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise that option. The\nGroup generally uses the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the ROU assets and liabilities.\nLease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Group determines if an\narrangement is a lease at inception. The lease payments under the lease arrangements are fixed. Non-lease components include payments for\nbuilding management, utilities and property tax. It separates the non-lease components from the lease components to which they relate. The\nGroup recorded right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities of $4,368 and $4,368 in the consolidated balance sheets upon the initial\nrecognition, respectively.\n(w) Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832)” (“ASU\n2021-10”). ASU 2021-10 provides guidance to increase the transparency of government assistance including the disclosure of (1) the types\nof assistance, (2) an entity’s accounting for the assistance, and (3) the effect of the assistance on an entity’s financial statements. ASU 2021-\n10 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The Group adopted and applied the amendments of this ASU to its\ndisclosures starting from January 1, 2022. The Group concludes that the application of this ASU did not have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This\nguidance amends ASC Topic 740 and addresses several aspects including1) evaluation of step-up tax basis of goodwill when there is not a\nbusiness combination, 2) policy election to not allocate consolidated taxes on a separate entity basis to entities not subject to income tax, 3)\naccounting for tax law changes or rates during interim periods, 4) ownership changes from equity method investment to subsidiary or vice\nversa, 5) elimination of exception to intra-period allocation when there is gain in discontinued operations and a loss from continuing\noperations, 6) treatment of franchise taxes that are partially based on income. For the Group as an EGC, the amendments in this update are\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Group adopted\nthis standard effective January 1, 2022 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements and\nrelated disclosures.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included a sunset provision such that Research and Experimental Expenses incurred after December 31,\n2021 are capitalized and amortized. US R&E expenses are amortized over five years and non-US R&E expenses are amortized over fifteen\nyears. As part of the December 31, 2022 tax provision calculation, the Group added back to taxable income, research expenditures of $1,472.\nThese expenses were incurred in the U.S. and amortized over 5 years for U.S. tax purposes.\nAccounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nReform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”), which provides elective amendments for entities that have contracts, hedging\nrelationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate\nreform. These amendments were effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging\nrelationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate\nReform (Topic 848), to expand and clarify the scope of Topic 848 to include derivative instruments on discounting transactions. The\namendments in this ASU are effective in the same timeframe as ASU 2020-04. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06,\nReference Rate reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which deferred the sunset date of Topic 848, Reference Rate\nReform to December 31, 2024. The Group is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract\nLiabilities from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2021-08”), which requires entities to recognize and measure contract assets and\nF-13\nTable of Contents\ncontract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nThe update will generally result in an entity recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at amounts consistent with those recorded by\nthe acquiree immediately before the acquisition date rather than at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Group will adopt ASU 2021-08 effective January 1, 2023 and apply\nthe guidance to subsequent acquisitions. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 will only impact the accounting for the Group’s future acquisitions.\nThe Group does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material\neffect on the consolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.\n4. Accounts Receivable, Net\nThe accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nAccounts receivable, customers $ 870 $ 681\nAccounts receivable, governmental incentive 675 555\nLess: Allowance for doubtful accounts (35) (35)\nAccounts receivable, net $ 1,510 $ 1,201\nNo provision for doubtful accounts were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022.

On August 3, 2021, the Company effectuated a 70,000 for 1 stock split on the Company’s\nissued and outstanding common stock.\nOn March 8, 2022, a shareholder meeting was held and declared a one-for-four reverse stock split effective on March 9, 2022. After\nthat, the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock is 17,500,000 shares. The authorized shares of common stock after the reverse\nstock splits are 450,000,000 shares of a par value of $0.0004.\nAs a result of the amendment of authorized stock, the stock split and reverse of stock split, all share and per share data in the\nconsolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to all periods presented.\nOn June 8, 2022, the Company sold 2,100,000 shares of its common stock in its IPO, at an offering price of $7.5 per share.

Although the SEPA provides that the Company may sell up to an aggregate of\n$10,000 of common stock to Investor, only 4,035,086 shares of the Company’s common stock, including the aggregate amount of 61,421\nCommitment Shares issued to Investor, have been registered. If the Company elect to sell to the Investor all of the 4,035,086 registered\nshares of common stock, depending on the market price of the Company’s common stock prior to each Advance made pursuant to the SEPA,\nthe actual gross proceeds from the sale of all such shares may be substantially less than the $10,000 available to the Company, which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s liquidity. The selling price is 93% of the market price as defined in the agreement. The Group\npaid YA Global II SPV, LLC, a subsidiary of the Investor, a structuring fee in the amount of $20 and also issued to the Investor common\nshares in an amount equal to $100 as a commitment fee.

Stock-based Compensation\nOn January 24, 2021, an option to purchase 1,050,000 fully vested common stocks, which has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect\nthe stock split as well as the reverse stock split as disclosed in Note 11 at an exercise price of $1.72 per share was granted to Mr. Xiaofeng\nDenton Peng, the chairman of the board of directors of the Group. The grant of options is a special one-time award in recognition of his\nwork done related to the business combination of PCL and PML in 2020. The options are valued using the Black- Scholes Option Valuation\nModel as of the grant date.\nOn January 24, 2021, the Group adopted the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) which permits the Group to grant stock\noptions to directors, officers or employees of the Group or others to purchase shares of common stock of the Company through awards of\nincentive and nonqualified stock options (“Option”). The total number of shares which may be issued under the 2021 Plan is 9% of the\nnumber of outstanding and issued common stocks of the Group.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, 880,500 options were granted to a group of managements and employees of the Group,\nwhich are subject to an annual vesting schedule that vests 25% of granted options over the next four years.

The exercise price was $1.72 per\nshare.\nThe Group measures employee stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards based on the grant-date fair\nvalue and recognizes the cost in the financial statements over the employee requisite service period. As stock-based compensation expense\nrecognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated\nforfeitures. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures\ndiffer from those estimates. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the stock-based compensation expense was $1,046 and\n$52, respectively.\nDetermining Fair Value\nValuation and Amortization Method — The Group estimates the fair value of service-based stock options granted using the Black-\nScholes option pricing formula. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards,\nwhich is generally the vesting period. Service-based options typically have a ten-year life from date of grant and vesting periods of\nfour years.\nExpected Term — The Group’s expected term represents the period that the Group’s share-based awards are expected to be outstanding.\nExpected Volatility — The Group uses the average historical volatility of the comparable public companies to calculate the volatility for\nits granted options.\nExpected Dividend — The Group has never paid dividends on its common stock and currently does not intend to do so, and accordingly,\nthe dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate — The Group bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation model upon the implied yield\ncurve currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the assumption in\nthe model.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nAssumptions used in the determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards using the Black- Scholes model for stock option\ngrants for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n2022 2021\nExpected term 6.25 years 6.25 years\nRisk-free interest rate 3.04%-3.97% 1.36% – 1.52%\nExpected volatility 137.7%-169.3% 64.4% – 87.73%\nExpected dividend yield 0% 0%\nThe following table summarizes the Group’s stock option activities:\nWeighted- Weighted-\nAverage Average Aggregate\nExercise Remaining Intrinsic\nPrice Contractual Value\nShares Per Share Term ($000)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2020 — — — $ —\nGranted 2,040,500 1.72 — —\nExercised — — — —\nForfeited/expired (354,000) 1.72 — —\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2021 1,686,500 1.72 9.45 years $ 2,091\nGranted 888,000 1.70 — —\nExercised (80,625) — — —\nForfeited/expired (731,375) 1.72 — —\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022 1,762,500 1.71 8.93 years $ 16\nExercisable as of December 31, 2022 212,063 1.63 8.25 years $ 12\nExpected to vest as of December 31, 2022 1,550,437 1.72 $ —\nChanges in the Group’s non-vested stock awards are summarized as follows:\nTime-based Options\nWeighted Average\nShares Exercise Price Per Share\nNon-vested as of December 31, 2020 — $ —\nGranted 2,040,500 1.72\nVested — —\nForfeited (354,000) 1.72\nNon-vested as of December 31, 2021 1,686,500 1.72\nGranted 888,000 1.70\nVested (333,313) —\nForfeited (690,750) 1.72\nNon-vested as of December 31, 2022 1,550,437 1.72\nThere were no changes to the contractual life of any fully vested options during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, there were $1,511 of unrecognized share-based compensation expenses related to the share options granted.

The federal net operating loss carry forwards are limited to 80% of taxable income. The Group had a total state net\noperating loss carry forwards of approximately $36,896, which will begin to expire in the year 2041 to 2042. The Group has a federal R&D\ncredit of $758, which will begin to expire from the year 2041 to 2042. The Group has a California R&D credit of $488, which will never\nexpire.\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nUtilization of the federal and state net operating losses may be subject to certain annual limitations under IRC Section 382 due to the\n“change in ownership” provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.\nThe Group has a full valuation allowance against US federal and state net operating losses.\nThe Group recognizes deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realized. Management\nreviews deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and makes estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of\ntaxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. Realization\nof the Group’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Because of the\nGroup’s lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance in the U.S. The valuation\nallowance increased by $4,495 and $4,994 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Group had no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Group currently files income tax\nreturns in the U.S., as well as California and Delaware. The Group is currently not the subject of any income tax examinations. The Group’s\ntax returns generally remain open for tax years after 2020.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economy Security (CARES) Act (“the CARES Act, H.R. 748”) was signed into law on 27 March\n2020. The CARES Act temporarily eliminates the 80% taxable income limitation (as enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) for\nNOL deductions for 2018-2020 tax years and reinstated NOL carrybacks for the 2018-2020 tax years. Moreover, the CARES Act also\ntemporarily increases the business interest deduction limitations from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income for the 2019 and 2020 taxable\nyear. Lastly, the Tax Act technical correction classifies qualified improvement property as 15-year recovery period, allowing the bonus\ndepreciation deduction to be claimed for such property retroactively as if it was included in the Tax Act at the time of enactment.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included a sunset provision such that Research and Experimental Expenses incurred after December 31,\n2021 are capitalized and amortized. US R&E expenses are amortized over five years and non-US R&E expenses are amortized over fifteen\nyears. As part of the December 31, 2022 tax provision calculation, the Group added back to taxable income, research expenditures of $1,472.\nThese expenses were incurred in the U.S. and amortized over 5 years for U.S. tax purposes.\n14. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments — As of December 31, 2022, the Group had other commitments of approximately $1,112. These commitments were\nsolely related to contracts signed with vendors for research and development by the Group and are expected to be paid in one year.\nContingency — In the ordinary course of business, the Group may be subject to legal proceedings regarding contractual and\nemployment relationships and a variety of other matters. The Group records contingent liabilities resulting from such claims, when a loss is\nassessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. There was a dispute with previous landlord in 2021, however, the\nlawsuit is in its early stage and the final outcome, including the potential amount of any losses, is uncertain. As a result, no reasonable\nestimate of loss can be made as of December 31, 2022.\nF-21\nTable of Contents\n15. Leases\nThe Group has operating leases for office facilities. The Group’s leases have remaining terms of less than one year to approximately 5\nyears.

(“we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) had one class of securities registered under Section\n12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”): its common stock, $0.0004 par value per share (“Common\nStock”).\nThe following summary of the material terms of our securities is not intended to be a complete description of all of the rights and\npreferences of such securities. Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and is\nqualified by reference to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amended and Restated Charter”) and the our\nBylaws, which are exhibits to this Annual Report. We urge you to read each of the Amended and Restated Charter and, the Bylaws in their\nentirety for a complete description of the rights and preferences of our securities, as well as the Delaware General Corporation Law, as\namended (the “DGCL”).\nGeneral\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 450,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0004 per shares, and 50,000,000 shares of\npreferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Preferred Stock”).\nCommon Stock\nEach holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of the\nstockholders, including the election of directors. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws do not provide for cumulative voting rights.\nSubject to preferences that may be applicable to any then outstanding preferred stock, the holders of our outstanding shares of common\nstock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of legally available funds.\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally\navailable for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities, subject to the satisfaction of any\nliquidation preference granted to the holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock.\nHolders of our common stock have no preemptive, conversion or subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund\nprovisions applicable to the common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of common stock are subject to, and may be\nadversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of our preferred stock that are outstanding or that we may designate\nand issue in the future.\nPreferred Stock\nOur board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation,\nredemption, voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. In addition,\nthe preferred stock could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us. Although we do not\ncurrently intend to issue any shares of preferred stock, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future.\nChoice of Forum\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n(2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty by any of our directors, officers, or stockholders owed to us or our\nstockholders; (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation or\nour Bylaws; or (4) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the\ninternal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (1) through (4) above, any claim (A) as to which the Court of Chancery determines that\nthere is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the\npersonal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive\njurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter\njurisdiction. If an action is brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of\nprocess on such stockholder’s counsel. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application\nof law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, a court may determine that this provision is unenforceable, and to the extent it is\nenforceable, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nUnless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the U.S. shall be the sole and\nexclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Under Section 22 of the\nSecurities Act, federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nSecurities Act, and stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAccordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims\narising under the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the forum selection clause will not apply to suits brought to enforce any\nliability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the U.S. shall be the sole and\nexclusive forum. This choice of forum provision has important consequences for our stockholders. See “Risk Factors — Risk Factors\nRelating to Ownership of Our Common Stock — Our Certificate of Incorporation includes a forum selection clause, which could discourage\nclaims or limit stockholders’ ability to make a claim against us, our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders.”\nAuthorized but Unissued Shares\nThe authorized but unissued shares of our common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder\napproval, subject to any limitations imposed by the listing standards of Nasdaq.\nThese additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The\nexistence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt\nto obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\nThe foregoing provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could\ndelay or prevent a change in control. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition\nof our board of directors and in the policies formulated by our board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may\ninvolve an actual or threatened change of control. These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition\nproposal. However, these provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and, as a\nconsequence, they also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover\nattempts. These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management or delaying or preventing a transaction that\nmight benefit you or other minority stockholders.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Vstock Transfer, LLC.
