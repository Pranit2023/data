The investment objective of the Fund is to seek investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield, before the Fund's fees and expenses, of an equity index called the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value™ Index.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. \n\nIndex Description According to the Index Provider\n\n  * The Index is an \"enhanced\" index created and administered by Nasdaq, Inc. (\"Nasdaq\") which employs the AlphaDEX® stock selection methodology to select stocks from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index that meet certain criteria.\n  * Nasdaq constructs the Index by ranking the eligible stocks from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index on growth factors including 3-, 6- and 12- month price appreciation, sales to price and one year sales growth, and separately on value factors including book value to price, cash flow to price and return on assets. All stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the growth factors and, separately, all stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the value factors. A stock must have data for all growth and/or value factors to receive a rank for that style.\n  * Each stock receives either its growth or value score as its selection score based on its style designation as determined by Nasdaq.

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and shares when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. \n\nAfter Tax Held returns represent return after taxes on distributions. Assumes shares have not been sold. After Tax Sold returns represent the return after taxes on distributions and the sale of fund shares. Returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Market Price returns are determined by using the midpoint of the national best bid offer price (\"NBBO\") as of the time that the fund's NAV is calculated. Returns are average annualized total returns, except those for periods of less than one year, which are cumulative. \n\nAfter-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. \n\n**Performance information for each listed index is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual fund performance. Indexes do not charge management fees or brokerage expenses, and no such fees or expenses were deducted from the performance shown. Indexes are unmanaged and an investor cannot invest directly in an index. \n\nOn April 8, 2016, the fund's underlying index changed from the Defined Mid Cap Value Index to the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value™ Index. Therefore, the fund's performance and historical returns shown for the periods prior to this date are not necessarily indicative of the performance that the fund, based on its current index, would have generated.\n\nNasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index - The Index is a float modified market capitalization weighted index that includes value securities from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap™ Index.\n\nRussell 3000® Index - The Index is comprised of the 3000 largest and most liquid stocks based and traded in the U.S.\n\nS&P MidCap 400® Value Index - The Index contains those stocks with value characteristics from the 400 stocks used to measure mid cap U.S. stock market performance.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1 | The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's outstanding shares.  \n---|---  \n2 | Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their market price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).  \n3 | The median bid-ask spread is calculated by identifying the national best bid and national best offer (\"NBBO\") for the fund as of the end of each 10 second interval during each trading day of the last 30 calendar days and dividing the difference between each such bid and offer by the midpoint of the NBBO. The median of those values is identified and that value is expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth.  \n4 | Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.  \n5 | The 30-day SEC yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the most recent 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period and includes the effects of fee waivers and expense reimbursements, if applicable.  \n6 | 12-Month Distribution Rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the fund's trailing 12-month ordinary distributions paid or declared by the NAV price. Distribution rates may vary.  \n7 | Index yield represents the weighted average trailing 12-month dividend of the constituents of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value(TM) Index.  \n8 | All market capitalization numbers are in USD$ Millions.  \n9 | Inception Date is 4/19/2011  \n  \n**You should consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing. You can download a prospectus or summary prospectus, or contact First Trust Portfolios L.P. at 1-800-621-1675 to request a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information about the fund. The prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.**\n\n##  Risk Considerations\n\n**You could lose money by investing in a fund. An investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed. There can be no assurance that a fund's objective(s) will be achieved. Investors buying or selling shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Please refer to each fund's prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for additional details on a fund's risks. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.**\n\nUnlike mutual funds, shares of the fund may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation/redemption units. If a fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at a premium or discount to a fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting and the bid/ask spread may widen.\n\nThe success of consumer discretionary companies is tied closely to the performance of the overall U.S. and international economies, interest rates, competition, consumer confidence, disposable household income and consumer spending. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for consumer discretionary products.\n\nCurrent market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates; however, the Federal Reserve has recently lowered interest rates and may continue to do so. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects.\n\nA fund is susceptible to operational risks through breaches in cyber security. Such events could cause a fund to incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures and/or financial loss.\n\nEquity securities may decline significantly in price over short or extended periods of time, and such declines may occur in the equity market as a whole, or they may occur in only a particular country, company, industry or sector of the market.\n\nFinancial services companies are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, currency exchange rates, government regulation, decreases in the availability of capital, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentration in geographic markets, industries or products, and competition from new entrants in their fields of business.\n\nAn index fund will be concentrated in an industry or a group of industries to the extent that the index is so concentrated. A fund with significant exposure to a single asset class, or the securities of issuers within the same country, state, region, industry, or sector may have its value more affected by an adverse economic, business or political development than a broadly diversified fund.\n\nA fund may be a constituent of one or more indices or models which could greatly affect a fund's trading activity, size and volatility.\n\nThere is no assurance that the index provider or its agents will compile or maintain the index accurately. Losses or costs associated with any index provider errors generally will be borne by a fund and its shareholders.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the securities held by a fund will stay within a fund's intended market capitalization range.\n\nA fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for fund shares due to a limited number of market makers. Decisions by market makers or authorized participants to reduce their role or step away in times of market stress could inhibit the effectiveness of the arbitrage process in maintaining the relationship between the underlying values of a fund's portfolio securities and a fund's market price.\n\nMid capitalization companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn index fund's return may not match the return of the index for a number of reasons including operating expenses, costs of buying and selling securities to reflect changes in the index, and the fact that a fund's portfolio holdings may not exactly replicate the index.\n\nA fund and a fund's advisor may seek to reduce various operational risks through controls and procedures, but it is not possible to completely protect against such risks. The fund also relies on third parties for a range of services, including custody, and any delay or failure related to those services may affect the fund's ability to meet its objective.\n\nA fund that invests in securities included in or representative of an index will hold those securities regardless of investment merit and the fund generally will not take defensive positions in declining markets.\n\nHigh portfolio turnover may result in higher levels of transaction costs and may generate greater tax liabilities for shareholders.\n\nThe market price of a fund's shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the fund's net asset value (\"NAV\") as well as the relative supply of and demand for shares on the exchange, and a fund's investment advisor cannot predict whether shares will trade below, at or above their NAV.\n\nTrading on an exchange may be halted due to market conditions or other reasons. There can be no assurance that a fund's requirements to maintain the exchange listing will continue to be met or be unchanged.\n\nValue characteristics of a stock may not be fully recognized for a long time or a stock judged to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced at a low level.\n\nFirst Trust Advisors L.P.

The investment objective of the Fund is to seek investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield, before the Fund's fees and expenses, of an equity index called the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value™ Index.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. \n\nIndex Description According to the Index Provider\n\n  * The Index is an \"enhanced\" index created and administered by Nasdaq, Inc. (\"Nasdaq\") which employs the AlphaDEX® stock selection methodology to select stocks from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index that meet certain criteria.\n  * Nasdaq constructs the Index by ranking the eligible stocks from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index on growth factors including 3-, 6- and 12- month price appreciation, sales to price and one year sales growth, and separately on value factors including book value to price, cash flow to price and return on assets. All stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the growth factors and, separately, all stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the value factors. A stock must have data for all growth and/or value factors to receive a rank for that style.\n  * Each stock receives either its growth or value score as its selection score based on its style designation as determined by Nasdaq. Only those stocks designated as value stocks are eligible for the portfolio.\n  * The top 225 stocks based on the selection score determined in the previous step comprise the \"selected stocks\".

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and shares when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. \n\nAfter Tax Held returns represent return after taxes on distributions. Assumes shares have not been sold. After Tax Sold returns represent the return after taxes on distributions and the sale of fund shares. Returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Market Price returns are determined by using the midpoint of the national best bid offer price (\"NBBO\") as of the time that the fund's NAV is calculated. Returns are average annualized total returns, except those for periods of less than one year, which are cumulative. \n\nAfter-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. \n\n**Performance information for each listed index is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual fund performance. Indexes do not charge management fees or brokerage expenses, and no such fees or expenses were deducted from the performance shown. Indexes are unmanaged and an investor cannot invest directly in an index. \n\nOn April 8, 2016, the fund's underlying index changed from the Defined Mid Cap Value Index to the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value™ Index. Therefore, the fund's performance and historical returns shown for the periods prior to this date are not necessarily indicative of the performance that the fund, based on its current index, would have generated.\n\nNasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index - The Index is a float modified market capitalization weighted index that includes value securities from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap™ Index.\n\nRussell 3000® Index - The Index is comprised of the 3000 largest and most liquid stocks based and traded in the U.S.\n\nS&P MidCap 400® Value Index - The Index contains those stocks with value characteristics from the 400 stocks used to measure mid cap U.S. stock market performance.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1 | The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's outstanding shares.  \n---|---  \n2 | Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their market price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).  \n3 | The median bid-ask spread is calculated by identifying the national best bid and national best offer (\"NBBO\") for the fund as of the end of each 10 second interval during each trading day of the last 30 calendar days and dividing the difference between each such bid and offer by the midpoint of the NBBO. The median of those values is identified and that value is expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth.  \n4 | Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.  \n5 | The 30-day SEC yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the most recent 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period and includes the effects of fee waivers and expense reimbursements, if applicable.  \n6 | 12-Month Distribution Rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the fund's trailing 12-month ordinary distributions paid or declared by the NAV price. Distribution rates may vary.  \n7 | Index yield represents the weighted average trailing 12-month dividend of the constituents of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value(TM) Index.  \n8 | All market capitalization numbers are in USD$ Millions.  \n9 | Inception Date is 4/19/2011  \n  \n**You should consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing. You can download a prospectus or summary prospectus, or contact First Trust Portfolios L.P. at 1-800-621-1675 to request a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information about the fund. The prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.**\n\n##  Risk Considerations\n\n**You could lose money by investing in a fund. An investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed. There can be no assurance that a fund's objective(s) will be achieved. Investors buying or selling shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Please refer to each fund's prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for additional details on a fund's risks. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.**\n\nUnlike mutual funds, shares of the fund may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation/redemption units. If a fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at a premium or discount to a fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting and the bid/ask spread may widen.\n\nThe success of consumer discretionary companies is tied closely to the performance of the overall U.S. and international economies, interest rates, competition, consumer confidence, disposable household income and consumer spending. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for consumer discretionary products.\n\nCurrent market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates; however, the Federal Reserve has recently lowered interest rates and may continue to do so. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects.\n\nA fund is susceptible to operational risks through breaches in cyber security. Such events could cause a fund to incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures and/or financial loss.\n\nEquity securities may decline significantly in price over short or extended periods of time, and such declines may occur in the equity market as a whole, or they may occur in only a particular country, company, industry or sector of the market.\n\nFinancial services companies are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, currency exchange rates, government regulation, decreases in the availability of capital, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentration in geographic markets, industries or products, and competition from new entrants in their fields of business.\n\nAn index fund will be concentrated in an industry or a group of industries to the extent that the index is so concentrated. A fund with significant exposure to a single asset class, or the securities of issuers within the same country, state, region, industry, or sector may have its value more affected by an adverse economic, business or political development than a broadly diversified fund.\n\nA fund may be a constituent of one or more indices or models which could greatly affect a fund's trading activity, size and volatility.\n\nThere is no assurance that the index provider or its agents will compile or maintain the index accurately. Losses or costs associated with any index provider errors generally will be borne by a fund and its shareholders.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the securities held by a fund will stay within a fund's intended market capitalization range.\n\nA fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for fund shares due to a limited number of market makers. Decisions by market makers or authorized participants to reduce their role or step away in times of market stress could inhibit the effectiveness of the arbitrage process in maintaining the relationship between the underlying values of a fund's portfolio securities and a fund's market price.\n\nMid capitalization companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn index fund's return may not match the return of the index for a number of reasons including operating expenses, costs of buying and selling securities to reflect changes in the index, and the fact that a fund's portfolio holdings may not exactly replicate the index.\n\nA fund and a fund's advisor may seek to reduce various operational risks through controls and procedures, but it is not possible to completely protect against such risks. The fund also relies on third parties for a range of services, including custody, and any delay or failure related to those services may affect the fund's ability to meet its objective.\n\nA fund that invests in securities included in or representative of an index will hold those securities regardless of investment merit and the fund generally will not take defensive positions in declining markets.\n\nHigh portfolio turnover may result in higher levels of transaction costs and may generate greater tax liabilities for shareholders.\n\nThe market price of a fund's shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the fund's net asset value (\"NAV\") as well as the relative supply of and demand for shares on the exchange, and a fund's investment advisor cannot predict whether shares will trade below, at or above their NAV.\n\nTrading on an exchange may be halted due to market conditions or other reasons. There can be no assurance that a fund's requirements to maintain the exchange listing will continue to be met or be unchanged.\n\nValue characteristics of a stock may not be fully recognized for a long time or a stock judged to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced at a low level.\n\nFirst Trust Advisors L.P.

The investment objective of the Fund is to seek investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield, before the Fund's fees and expenses, of an equity index called the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value™ Index.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. \n\nIndex Description According to the Index Provider\n\n  * The Index is an \"enhanced\" index created and administered by Nasdaq, Inc. (\"Nasdaq\") which employs the AlphaDEX® stock selection methodology to select stocks from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index that meet certain criteria.\n  * Nasdaq constructs the Index by ranking the eligible stocks from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index on growth factors including 3-, 6- and 12- month price appreciation, sales to price and one year sales growth, and separately on value factors including book value to price, cash flow to price and return on assets. All stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the growth factors and, separately, all stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the value factors. A stock must have data for all growth and/or value factors to receive a rank for that style.\n  * Each stock receives either its growth or value score as its selection score based on its style designation as determined by Nasdaq. Only those stocks designated as value stocks are eligible for the portfolio.\n  * The top 225 stocks based on the selection score determined in the previous step comprise the \"selected stocks\".

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and shares when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. \n\nAfter Tax Held returns represent return after taxes on distributions. Assumes shares have not been sold. After Tax Sold returns represent the return after taxes on distributions and the sale of fund shares. Returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Market Price returns are determined by using the midpoint of the national best bid offer price (\"NBBO\") as of the time that the fund's NAV is calculated. Returns are average annualized total returns, except those for periods of less than one year, which are cumulative. \n\nAfter-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. \n\n**Performance information for each listed index is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual fund performance. Indexes do not charge management fees or brokerage expenses, and no such fees or expenses were deducted from the performance shown. Indexes are unmanaged and an investor cannot invest directly in an index. \n\nOn April 8, 2016, the fund's underlying index changed from the Defined Mid Cap Value Index to the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value™ Index. Therefore, the fund's performance and historical returns shown for the periods prior to this date are not necessarily indicative of the performance that the fund, based on its current index, would have generated.\n\nNasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index - The Index is a float modified market capitalization weighted index that includes value securities from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap™ Index.\n\nRussell 3000® Index - The Index is comprised of the 3000 largest and most liquid stocks based and traded in the U.S.\n\nS&P MidCap 400® Value Index - The Index contains those stocks with value characteristics from the 400 stocks used to measure mid cap U.S. stock market performance.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1 | The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's outstanding shares.  \n---|---  \n2 | Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their market price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).  \n3 | The median bid-ask spread is calculated by identifying the national best bid and national best offer (\"NBBO\") for the fund as of the end of each 10 second interval during each trading day of the last 30 calendar days and dividing the difference between each such bid and offer by the midpoint of the NBBO. The median of those values is identified and that value is expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth.  \n4 | Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.  \n5 | The 30-day SEC yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the most recent 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period and includes the effects of fee waivers and expense reimbursements, if applicable.  \n6 | 12-Month Distribution Rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the fund's trailing 12-month ordinary distributions paid or declared by the NAV price. Distribution rates may vary.  \n7 | Index yield represents the weighted average trailing 12-month dividend of the constituents of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value(TM) Index.  \n8 | All market capitalization numbers are in USD$ Millions.  \n9 | Inception Date is 4/19/2011  \n  \n**You should consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing. You can download a prospectus or summary prospectus, or contact First Trust Portfolios L.P. at 1-800-621-1675 to request a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information about the fund. The prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.**\n\n##  Risk Considerations\n\n**You could lose money by investing in a fund. An investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed. There can be no assurance that a fund's objective(s) will be achieved. Investors buying or selling shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Please refer to each fund's prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for additional details on a fund's risks. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.**\n\nUnlike mutual funds, shares of the fund may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation/redemption units. If a fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at a premium or discount to a fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting and the bid/ask spread may widen.\n\nThe success of consumer discretionary companies is tied closely to the performance of the overall U.S. and international economies, interest rates, competition, consumer confidence, disposable household income and consumer spending. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for consumer discretionary products.\n\nCurrent market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates; however, the Federal Reserve has recently lowered interest rates and may continue to do so. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects.\n\nA fund is susceptible to operational risks through breaches in cyber security. Such events could cause a fund to incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures and/or financial loss.\n\nEquity securities may decline significantly in price over short or extended periods of time, and such declines may occur in the equity market as a whole, or they may occur in only a particular country, company, industry or sector of the market.\n\nFinancial services companies are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, currency exchange rates, government regulation, decreases in the availability of capital, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentration in geographic markets, industries or products, and competition from new entrants in their fields of business.\n\nAn index fund will be concentrated in an industry or a group of industries to the extent that the index is so concentrated. A fund with significant exposure to a single asset class, or the securities of issuers within the same country, state, region, industry, or sector may have its value more affected by an adverse economic, business or political development than a broadly diversified fund.\n\nA fund may be a constituent of one or more indices or models which could greatly affect a fund's trading activity, size and volatility.\n\nThere is no assurance that the index provider or its agents will compile or maintain the index accurately. Losses or costs associated with any index provider errors generally will be borne by a fund and its shareholders.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the securities held by a fund will stay within a fund's intended market capitalization range.\n\nA fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for fund shares due to a limited number of market makers. Decisions by market makers or authorized participants to reduce their role or step away in times of market stress could inhibit the effectiveness of the arbitrage process in maintaining the relationship between the underlying values of a fund's portfolio securities and a fund's market price.\n\nMid capitalization companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn index fund's return may not match the return of the index for a number of reasons including operating expenses, costs of buying and selling securities to reflect changes in the index, and the fact that a fund's portfolio holdings may not exactly replicate the index.\n\nA fund and a fund's advisor may seek to reduce various operational risks through controls and procedures, but it is not possible to completely protect against such risks. The fund also relies on third parties for a range of services, including custody, and any delay or failure related to those services may affect the fund's ability to meet its objective.\n\nA fund that invests in securities included in or representative of an index will hold those securities regardless of investment merit and the fund generally will not take defensive positions in declining markets.\n\nHigh portfolio turnover may result in higher levels of transaction costs and may generate greater tax liabilities for shareholders.\n\nThe market price of a fund's shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the fund's net asset value (\"NAV\") as well as the relative supply of and demand for shares on the exchange, and a fund's investment advisor cannot predict whether shares will trade below, at or above their NAV.\n\nTrading on an exchange may be halted due to market conditions or other reasons. There can be no assurance that a fund's requirements to maintain the exchange listing will continue to be met or be unchanged.\n\nValue characteristics of a stock may not be fully recognized for a long time or a stock judged to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced at a low level.\n\nFirst Trust Advisors L.P.

The investment objective of the Fund is to seek investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield, before the Fund's fees and expenses, of an equity index called the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value™ Index.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. \n\nIndex Description According to the Index Provider\n\n  * The Index is an \"enhanced\" index created and administered by Nasdaq, Inc. (\"Nasdaq\") which employs the AlphaDEX® stock selection methodology to select stocks from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index that meet certain criteria.\n  * Nasdaq constructs the Index by ranking the eligible stocks from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index on growth factors including 3-, 6- and 12- month price appreciation, sales to price and one year sales growth, and separately on value factors including book value to price, cash flow to price and return on assets. All stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the growth factors and, separately, all stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the value factors. A stock must have data for all growth and/or value factors to receive a rank for that style.\n  * Each stock receives either its growth or value score as its selection score based on its style designation as determined by Nasdaq. Only those stocks designated as value stocks are eligible for the portfolio.\n  * The top 225 stocks based on the selection score determined in the previous step comprise the \"selected stocks\".

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and shares when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. \n\nAfter Tax Held returns represent return after taxes on distributions. Assumes shares have not been sold. After Tax Sold returns represent the return after taxes on distributions and the sale of fund shares. Returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Market Price returns are determined by using the midpoint of the national best bid offer price (\"NBBO\") as of the time that the fund's NAV is calculated. Returns are average annualized total returns, except those for periods of less than one year, which are cumulative. \n\nAfter-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. \n\n**Performance information for each listed index is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual fund performance. Indexes do not charge management fees or brokerage expenses, and no such fees or expenses were deducted from the performance shown. Indexes are unmanaged and an investor cannot invest directly in an index. \n\nOn April 8, 2016, the fund's underlying index changed from the Defined Mid Cap Value Index to the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value™ Index. Therefore, the fund's performance and historical returns shown for the periods prior to this date are not necessarily indicative of the performance that the fund, based on its current index, would have generated.\n\nNasdaq US 600 Mid Cap Value™ Index - The Index is a float modified market capitalization weighted index that includes value securities from the Nasdaq US 600 Mid Cap™ Index.\n\nRussell 3000® Index - The Index is comprised of the 3000 largest and most liquid stocks based and traded in the U.S.\n\nS&P MidCap 400® Value Index - The Index contains those stocks with value characteristics from the 400 stocks used to measure mid cap U.S. stock market performance.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1 | The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's outstanding shares.  \n---|---  \n2 | Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their market price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).  \n3 | The median bid-ask spread is calculated by identifying the national best bid and national best offer (\"NBBO\") for the fund as of the end of each 10 second interval during each trading day of the last 30 calendar days and dividing the difference between each such bid and offer by the midpoint of the NBBO. The median of those values is identified and that value is expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth.  \n4 | Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.  \n5 | The 30-day SEC yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the most recent 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period and includes the effects of fee waivers and expense reimbursements, if applicable.  \n6 | 12-Month Distribution Rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the fund's trailing 12-month ordinary distributions paid or declared by the NAV price. Distribution rates may vary.  \n7 | Index yield represents the weighted average trailing 12-month dividend of the constituents of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX® Mid Cap Value(TM) Index.  \n8 | All market capitalization numbers are in USD$ Millions.  \n9 | Inception Date is 4/19/2011  \n  \n**You should consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing. You can download a prospectus or summary prospectus, or contact First Trust Portfolios L.P. at 1-800-621-1675 to request a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information about the fund. The prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.**\n\n##  Risk Considerations\n\n**You could lose money by investing in a fund. An investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed. There can be no assurance that a fund's objective(s) will be achieved. Investors buying or selling shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Please refer to each fund's prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for additional details on a fund's risks. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.**\n\nUnlike mutual funds, shares of the fund may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation/redemption units. If a fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at a premium or discount to a fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting and the bid/ask spread may widen.\n\nThe success of consumer discretionary companies is tied closely to the performance of the overall U.S. and international economies, interest rates, competition, consumer confidence, disposable household income and consumer spending. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for consumer discretionary products.\n\nCurrent market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates; however, the Federal Reserve has recently lowered interest rates and may continue to do so. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects.\n\nA fund is susceptible to operational risks through breaches in cyber security. Such events could cause a fund to incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures and/or financial loss.\n\nEquity securities may decline significantly in price over short or extended periods of time, and such declines may occur in the equity market as a whole, or they may occur in only a particular country, company, industry or sector of the market.\n\nFinancial services companies are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, currency exchange rates, government regulation, decreases in the availability of capital, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentration in geographic markets, industries or products, and competition from new entrants in their fields of business.\n\nAn index fund will be concentrated in an industry or a group of industries to the extent that the index is so concentrated. A fund with significant exposure to a single asset class, or the securities of issuers within the same country, state, region, industry, or sector may have its value more affected by an adverse economic, business or political development than a broadly diversified fund.\n\nA fund may be a constituent of one or more indices or models which could greatly affect a fund's trading activity, size and volatility.\n\nThere is no assurance that the index provider or its agents will compile or maintain the index accurately. Losses or costs associated with any index provider errors generally will be borne by a fund and its shareholders.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the securities held by a fund will stay within a fund's intended market capitalization range.\n\nA fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for fund shares due to a limited number of market makers. Decisions by market makers or authorized participants to reduce their role or step away in times of market stress could inhibit the effectiveness of the arbitrage process in maintaining the relationship between the underlying values of a fund's portfolio securities and a fund's market price.\n\nMid capitalization companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn index fund's return may not match the return of the index for a number of reasons including operating expenses, costs of buying and selling securities to reflect changes in the index, and the fact that a fund's portfolio holdings may not exactly replicate the index.\n\nA fund and a fund's advisor may seek to reduce various operational risks through controls and procedures, but it is not possible to completely protect against such risks. The fund also relies on third parties for a range of services, including custody, and any delay or failure related to those services may affect the fund's ability to meet its objective.\n\nA fund that invests in securities included in or representative of an index will hold those securities regardless of investment merit and the fund generally will not take defensive positions in declining markets.\n\nHigh portfolio turnover may result in higher levels of transaction costs and may generate greater tax liabilities for shareholders.\n\nThe market price of a fund's shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the fund's net asset value (\"NAV\") as well as the relative supply of and demand for shares on the exchange, and a fund's investment advisor cannot predict whether shares will trade below, at or above their NAV.\n\nTrading on an exchange may be halted due to market conditions or other reasons. There can be no assurance that a fund's requirements to maintain the exchange listing will continue to be met or be unchanged.\n\nValue characteristics of a stock may not be fully recognized for a long time or a stock judged to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced at a low level.\n\nFirst Trust Advisors L.P.
