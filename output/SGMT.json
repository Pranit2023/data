(Sagimet, Nasdaq: SGMT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics targeting dysfunctional metabolic and fibrotic pathways, today announced the presentation of Phase 2b data demonstrating the anti-fibrotic activity of its fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor denifanstat, and preclinical data demonstrating potential benefit of FASN inhibition in atherosclerosis, at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) - The Liver Meeting 2024®, November 15-19, 2024 in San Diego, California.\n\n“Our presentations of data from the Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 study highlight denifanstat’s impact on liver fibrosis, particularly in difficult-to-treat subsets of MASH patients who are at the highest risk of disease progression,” said Dave Happel, Chief Executive Officer of Sagimet. “Using an AI-based digital pathology approach, we observed pronounced fibrosis reduction in the peri-portal and portal zones of the liver, which as part of composite scores have recently been shown to correlate with liver outcomes and mortality, that may not be captured using conventional histological scoring. Finally, our preclinical data in a mouse model of MASH and dyslipidemia treated with a FASN inhibitor that is a surrogate for denifanstat showed that a FASN inhibitor may reduce circulating cholesterol and atherosclerosis development. Together, these results demonstrate the anti-fibrotic effects and potential cardiometabolic benefits of FASN inhibition and support the advancement of denifanstat into Phase 3 development.”\n\nA poster titled “ _Denifanstat significantly improves liver fibrosis in difficult-to-treat MASH patients – Results from conventional and AI-based pathology from the phase 2b FASCINATE-2, a 52-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial_ ,” was presented by Rohit Loomba, M.D., M.H.Sc., Professor of Medicine, Chief, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, and Director, MASLD Research Center, University of California San Diego, the primary investigator of the FASCINATE-2 trial. Denifanstat treatment improved fibrosis by ≥ 1 stage without worsening of MASH in the higher-risk patient subgroups described below. Observed improvements by conventional pathology reading included:\n\n  * F3 population: 49% denifanstat (n=47) vs 13% placebo (n=23) (p=0.0032)\n  * GLP1 receptor agonist population: 42% denifanstat (n=12) vs 0% placebo (n=4) (p=0.034)\n  * Type 2 diabetes population: 40% denifanstat (n=55) vs 19% placebo (n=27) (p=0.0382)\n  * PNPLA3 I148 carrier population: 30% denifanstat (n=33) vs 6% placebo (n=17) (p=0.022)\n\n\n\nStrong consistency in fibrosis improvement was observed between conventional and AI-based pathology in the F3 population. Denifanstat treatment improved fibrosis by ≥ 1 stage in more than 50% of F3 patients as follows:\n\n  * AI-based: 62% denifanstat (n=47) and 26% placebo (n=23) (p=0.005)\n  * Conventional: 55% denifanstat (n=47) and 26% placebo (n=23) (p=0.021)\n\n\n\nAn oral presentation titled “ _AI-based digital pathology shows that denifanstat improves multiple parameters of fibrosis and reduces progression to cirrhosis in MASH patients with F2/F3 fibrosis – results of the FASCINATE-2 study_ ,” was presented by Mary Rinella, M.D. (University of Chicago). In this analysis, second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy AI-based digital pathology was used to evaluate pre- and post-treatment liver biopsies. Denifanstat showed statistically significant liver fibrosis improvement, particularly in the portal and peri-portal regions. Improvement was observed with AI-based digital pathology not only in patients with >1-stage fibrosis improvement but also in patients with “no change” in fibrosis stage by conventional reading, representing important mechanistic insights provided by the AI-based platform. Select fibrosis parameters in the periportal and portal regions are part of AI-based composite score that have been recently linked to liver outcomes and mortality. Overall, both AI and conventional pathology readings demonstrated denifanstat's strong anti-fibrotic activity in MASH patients, including those with high risk of progression. These data reflect the unique mechanism of action of denifanstat and support the initiation of phase 3 trials.\n\nLastly, a poster titled “ _Fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor reduces atherosclerosis development in diet-induced dyslipidaemia LDL receptor knockout mice with MASH_ ,” was presented by Wen-Wei Tsai, Ph.D. (Sagimet Biosciences). In this mouse model, treatment with a FASN inhibitor that is a preclinical surrogate for denifanstat rapidly reduced circulating cholesterol, triglycerides and inflammatory markers associated with atherosclerosis, including CCL4 and CXCL2. The FASN inhibitor also reduced total atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic root and improved liver steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. These preclinical results suggest that a FASN inhibitor such as denifanstat could potentially provide benefits in cardiovascular as well as liver health, supporting the clinical evaluation of denifanstat for long term outcomes in MASH patients.\n\n**About Sagimet Biosciences **\n\nSagimet is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitors that are designed to target dysfunctional metabolic and fibrotic pathways in diseases resulting from the overproduction of the fatty acid, palmitate.

In 2023, global liver disease medical societies and patient groups formalized the decision to rename non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to MASH. Additionally, an overarching term, steatotic liver disease (SLD), was established to capture multiple types of liver diseases associated with fat buildup in the liver. The goal of the name change was to establish an affirmative, non-stigmatizing name and to improve diagnostic clarity.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of, and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of, The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: SGMT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics targeting dysfunctional metabolic and fibrotic pathways, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided recent corporate updates.\n\n“As we approach the end of 2024, the Sagimet team remains focused on advancing denifanstat towards a pivotal Phase 3 program in MASH,” said David Happel, Chief Executive Officer of Sagimet. “The publication of our Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 study results in a highly regarded _Lancet_ journal highlighted denifanstat’s strong efficacy and tolerability data and its highly differentiated mechanism of action which enables denifanstat to improve the key drivers of MASH: fat accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. In addition, we are proud to have recently received Breakthrough Therapy designation for denifanstat in MASH from the FDA, demonstrating denifanstat’s potential to address the significant unmet need for new therapies for this serious disease, and, with the successful completion of end-of-Phase 2 interactions with FDA, we look forward to initiating our planned Phase 3 program for denifanstat by the end of 2024.”\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * On October 29, Sagimet announced the successful completion of end-of-Phase 2 interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), supporting the advancement of denifanstat into Phase 3 development in metabolic-dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The planned program will include two Phase 3 trials: FASCINATE-3, evaluating patients with F2/F3 (non-cirrhotic) MASH, and FASCINIT, evaluating patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)/MASH.\n  * On October 11, the Company announced the [publication](https://sagimet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/24TLGastro0341_Loomba.pdf \"publication\") of results from the Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 clinical trial of denifanstat in _The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology_. The publication, titled “Denifanstat for the treatment of Metabolic-dysfunction Associated Steatohepatitis: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, ph2b trial,” reported that denifanstat treatment achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in disease activity, MASH resolution and fibrosis.\n  * On October 1, Sagimet announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to denifanstat for the treatment of non-cirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). Breakthrough Therapy designation was supported by positive data from the Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 trial in biopsy-confirmed F2/F3 MASH patients and continuing unmet need for differentiated therapies.\n  * On September 26, the Company delivered an oral [presentation](https://sagimet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MASH-Summit-OFarrell-Sept-2024-002.pdf \"presentation\") at the 8th Annual MASH Drug Development Summit highlighting denifanstat’s direct anti-fibrotic activity in MASH.\n  * On August 1, the Company announced the appointment to its board of directors of Dr. Anne Phillips and Jennifer Jarrett, two biotechnology industry leaders with extensive experience in clinical development, regulatory strategy, operations, and finance.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * The Phase 3 program for denifanstat in MASH is expected to initiate by the end of 2024. Based on ongoing discussions with the FDA, the planned Phase 3 program will consist of two double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter registrational trials: \n    * FASCINATE-3 in patients with F2/F3 (non-cirrhotic) MASH: The trial is expected to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denifanstat in this population, with primary endpoints being liver biopsy assessments at 52 weeks, at which time Sagimet plans to seek accelerated approval in the US and Europe. The trial will continue until such point in time that the required number of clinical outcomes is reached, estimated at 3.5 years.\n    * FASCINIT in patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of MASLD/MASH: The trial is expected to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denifanstat in this population, with primary endpoints being safety and tolerability at 52 weeks. Non-invasive biomarkers will be assessed as part of the secondary endpoints, with no liver biopsy endpoint.\n    * The Phase 3 program is designed to comprise a minimum of 1,800 patients exposed to denifanstat.\n  * In November 2024, the Company’s license partner for Greater China, Ascletis BioScience Co.Ltd. (Ascletis) announced completion of enrollment of 480 patients in its Phase 3 clinical trial of denifanstat for acne in China, and that it expects to announce topline results in the second quarter of 2025. The Phase 3 trial was initiated following positive Phase 2 acne data reported in Q2 2023.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n  * **Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities** as of September 30, 2024 was $170.0 million, including $104.7 million net proceeds from our January 2024 follow-on offering, which are expected to fund operations through 2025 based on management’s current operating plan. \n  * **Research and development expense** for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $12.7 million and $24.2 million, respectively, compared to $5.0 million and $14.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n  * **General and administrative expense** for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.2 million and $12.0 million, respectively, compared to $4.5 million and $9.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n  * **Net loss for** the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $14.6 million and $29.4 million, respectively, compared to $6.4 million and $19.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n**About Sagimet Biosciences**\n\nSagimet is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitors that are designed to target dysfunctional metabolic and fibrotic pathways in diseases resulting from the overproduction of the fatty acid, palmitate. Sagimet’s lead drug candidate, denifanstat, is an oral, once-daily pill and selective FASN inhibitor in development for the treatment of MASH. FASCINATE-2, a Phase 2b clinical trial of denifanstat in MASH with liver biopsy-based primary endpoints, was successfully completed with positive results.

In 2023, global liver disease medical societies and patient groups formalized the decision to rename non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to MASH. Additionally, an overarching term, steatotic liver disease (SLD), was established to capture multiple types of liver diseases associated with fat buildup in the liver. The goal of the name change was to establish an affirmative, non-stigmatizing name and diagnosis.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of, and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of, The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
