Treatment of ALK-Positive Lung Cancer_\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — (Nov. 20, 2024) — [Genprex, Inc.](https://www.genprex.com/) (“Genprex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: [GNPX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gnpx)), a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing therapies for patients with cancer and diabetes, today announced it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Michigan, granting Genprex a worldwide, exclusive license to the University’s patent rights relating to its lead drug candidate, Reqorsa® Gene Therapy (quaratusugene ozeplasmid), in combination with ALK-inhibitors for the potential treatment of ALK-EML4 positive translocated lung cancer.\n\n“We continue to bolster our intellectual property portfolio for REQORSA, understanding that our lead drug candidate may benefit patients with many types of cancers,” said Thomas Gallagher, Esq., Senior Vice President of Intellectual Property and Licensing at Genprex. “Positive preclinical data indicate that REQORSA in combination with ALK inhibitors may provide benefit to patients with ALK-positive (ALK+) lung cancer. We are pleased to be able to protect this drug combination for a new subset of lung cancer patients, which widens our exclusivity of drug combinations with REQORSA and enhances our intellectual property position.”\n\nREQORSA in combination with ALK inhibitors could be a potential therapeutic treatment for ALK+ lung cancer. TUSC2 is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently deleted in lung cancer. In fact, approximately 82% of all NSCLCs lack or express decreased amounts of TUSC2 tumor suppressor protein. ALK translocations are found in approximately 5% of NSCLCs. Research collaborators at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center’s Judith Tam ALK Lung Cancer Research Initiative presented positive preclinical data at the April 2024 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, reporting that [REQORSA induced apoptosis in alectinib resistant EML4-ALK positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines](https://www.genprex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-aacr-poster-quaratusugene-ozeplasmid-mediated-tusc2-upregulation-in-eml4-alk-bearing-non-small-cell-lung-carcinoma-can-induce-cellular-apoptosis.pdf). \n\nThe study found that the use of REQORSA or a TUSC2-containing plasmid to overexpress TUSC2 in ALK+ NSCLC cell lines was effective in decreasing cell growth and proliferation through the activation of apoptotic pathways. Researchers believe the results of this preclinical work support further clinical study of REQORSA as an anti-ALK NSCLC treatment strategy. Genprex believes this research suggests that REQORSA may be an effective treatment in patients progressing on ALK inhibitors. To review the poster presented at the 2024 AACR Annual meeting, visit [Genprex’s website](https://www.genprex.com/downloads/).\n\n**About Reqorsa® Gene Therapy**\n\nREQORSA (quaratusugene ozeplasmid) for NSCLC and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) consists of the TUSC2 gene expressing plasmid encapsulated in non-viral nanoparticles made from lipid molecules (Genprex’s ONCOPREX® Delivery System) with a positive electrical charge. REQORSA is injected intravenously and specifically targets cancer cells, which generally have a negative electrical charge. REQORSA is designed to deliver the functioning TUSC2 gene to cancer cells while minimizing their uptake by normal tissue. REQORSA has a multimodal mechanism of action whereby it interrupts cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells, re-establishes pathways for programmed cell death, or apoptosis, in cancer cells, and modulates the immune response against cancer cells.\n\nGenprex’s strategy is to develop REQORSA in combination with currently approved therapies and believes that REQORSA’s unique attributes position it to provide treatments that improve on these current therapies for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, and possibly other cancers.\n\n**About Genprex, Inc.**\n\nGenprex, Inc. is a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing therapies for patients with cancer and diabetes. Genprex’s technologies are designed to administer disease-fighting genes to provide new therapies for large patient populations with cancer and diabetes who currently have limited treatment options. Genprex works with world-class institutions and collaborators to develop drug candidates to further its pipeline of gene therapies in order to provide novel treatment approaches. Genprex’s oncology program utilizes its systemic, non-viral Oncoprex® Delivery System which encapsulates the gene-expressing plasmids using lipid-based nanoparticles in a lipoplex form. The resultant product is administered intravenously, where it is taken up by tumor cells that then express tumor suppressor proteins that were deficient in the tumor. The Company’s lead product candidate, Reqorsa® Gene Therapy (quaratusugene ozeplasmid), is being evaluated in two clinical trials as a treatment for NSCLC and SCLC. Each of Genprex’s lung cancer clinical programs has received a Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the treatment of that patient population, and Genprex’s SCLC program has received an FDA Orphan Drug Designation. Genprex’s diabetes gene therapy approach is comprised of a novel infusion process that uses an AAV vector to deliver Pdx1 and MafA genes directly to the pancreas. In models of Type 1 diabetes, GPX-002 transforms alpha cells in the pancreas into functional beta-like cells, which can produce insulin but may be distinct enough from beta cells to evade the body’s immune system. In a similar approach, GPX-002 for Type 2 diabetes, where autoimmunity is not at play, is believed to rejuvenate and replenish exhausted beta cells.\n\nInterested investors and shareholders are encouraged to sign up for press releases and industry updates by visiting the [Company Website](https://www.genprex.com/), registering for [Email Alerts](https://www.genprex.com/email-alerts/) and by following Genprex on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/genprex), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/genprexinc) and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/company/genprex).\n\n**Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nStatements contained in this press release regarding matters that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The poster will be presented at the 39th Annual Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Meeting being held November 6-10, 2024 in Houston, Texas. \n\n“We are pleased to have our academic partner present their findings on REQORSA at this prestigious cancer meeting, expanding on REQORSA’s ability to modulate immune responses in cancer,” said Ryan Confer, President and Chief Executive Officer at Genprex. “We continue to bolster the growing body of evidence supporting REQORSA’s anti-tumor mechanisms, highlighting its therapeutic potential to treat a variety of cancers.”\n\nThe Genprex-supported poster to be presented at the [2024 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting](https://www.sitcancer.org/2024/home):\n\n**Title:** “TUSC2 Modulates Cancer Immune Responses”\n\n**Collaborator:** Meharry Medical College\n\nIn this study, researchers used comparative flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes, lymph nodes cells, and tumor infiltrating leucocytes (TILs) from TUSC2 Knock Out (KO) and TUSC2 Wild Type (WT) mice. FACS analysis was focused on the differences in T reg, Cytotoxic T cells and NK cells between the two mice groups. For analysis of immune responses to tumors, researchers challenged two groups of TUSC2 KO mice with syngeneic 129 Sv background metastatic lung cancer 344SQ cells and injected one group with TUSC2-expressing lipoparticles (REQORSA).\n\nIn the REQORSA supplemented group, the tumor growth was diminished. A significant reduction in T reg and significant increase in Cytotoxic T cells and NK cells were observed within TILs. A significant increase in Granzyme B expression within Cytotoxic T cells and NK cells was shown in REQORSA supplemented mice compared to the control group. \n\nThis research expanded on previous studies showing that REQORSA modulates immune cells within the Tumor Micro Environment. REQORSA-dependent changes in immune cells correlated with the reduction in tumor size in the experimental group, indicating that REQORSA may carry anti-tumor potential even for individuals with low overall TUSC levels in various tissues due to aging, chronic inflammation, metabolic diseases, etc. This research documents that REQORSA treatment has been shown to lead to increased immune response against tumors in TUSC2 KO mice.\n\nTUSC2 is the tumor suppressor gene used in REQORSA. REQORSA consists of a TUSC2 gene expressing plasmid encapsulated in non-viral lipid-based nanoparticles in a lipoplex form (the Company’s Oncoprex® Delivery System), which has a positive charge. REQORSA is injected intravenously and specifically targets cancer cells. REQORSA is designed to deliver the functioning TUSC2 gene to negatively charged cancer cells while minimizing uptake by normal tissue. Laboratory studies conducted at MD Anderson show that the uptake of TUSC2 in tumor cells in vitro after REQORSA treatment was 10 to 33 times the uptake in normal cells.\n\nFollowing the conference, the poster will be made available to download on [Genprex’s website](https://www.genprex.com/investors/downloads/), where it can be reviewed in greater detail.\n\n**About Genprex, Inc.**\n\nGenprex, Inc. is a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing therapies for patients with cancer and diabetes.

In addition, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Confer, and Chief Medical Officer, Mark Berger, MD, will be participating virtually. Throughout the duration of the conference, Genprex will be available to conduct one-on-one meetings with industry and investor groups to provide an overview of the Company’s gene therapies for cancer and diabetes.\n\nFor those interested in meeting Genprex management during the conference, please request a meeting through the conference portal or reach out to Investor Relations at investors@genprex.com. \n\n**About Genprex, Inc.**\n\nGenprex, Inc. is a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing therapies for patients with cancer and diabetes. Genprex’s technologies are designed to administer disease-fighting genes to provide new therapies for large patient populations with cancer and diabetes who currently have limited treatment options. Genprex works with world-class institutions and collaborators to develop drug candidates to further its pipeline of gene therapies in order to provide novel treatment approaches. Genprex’s oncology program utilizes its systemic, non-viral Oncoprex® Delivery System which encapsulates the gene-expressing plasmids using lipid-based nanoparticles in a lipoplex form. The resultant product is administered intravenously, where it is taken up by tumor cells that then express tumor suppressor proteins that were deficient in the tumor. The Company’s lead product candidate, Reqorsa® Gene Therapy (quaratusugene ozeplasmid), is being evaluated in two clinical trials as a treatment for NSCLC and SCLC. Each of Genprex’s lung cancer clinical programs has received a Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the treatment of that patient population, and Genprex’s SCLC program has received an FDA Orphan Drug Designation. Genprex’s diabetes gene therapy approach is comprised of a novel infusion process that uses an AAV vector to deliver Pdx1 and MafA genes directly to the pancreas. In models of Type 1 diabetes, GPX-002 transforms alpha cells in the pancreas into functional beta-like cells, which can produce insulin but may be distinct enough from beta cells to evade the body’s immune system. In a similar approach, GPX-002 for Type 2 diabetes, where autoimmunity is not at play, is believed to rejuvenate and replenish exhausted beta cells.\n\nInterested investors and shareholders are encouraged to sign up for press releases and industry updates by visiting the [Company Website](https://www.genprex.com/), registering for [Email Alerts](https://www.genprex.com/email-alerts/) and by following Genprex on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/genprex), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/genprexinc) and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/company/genprex).\n\n**Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nStatements contained in this press release regarding matters that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The collaborators presented posters on positive preclinical data from studies of Genprex’s lead drug candidate, Reqorsa® Gene Therapy (quaratusugene ozeplasmid), for the treatment of Ras inhibitor resistant lung cancer, mesothelioma and glioblastoma.\n\n“We are pleased by this promising preclinical data, presented before a prestigious audience of oncology researchers, of REQORSA’s potential in serious and difficult to treat cancers including KRAS G12C mutant lung cancer, mesothelioma, and glioblastoma,” said Ryan Confer, President and Chief Executive Officer at Genprex. “The role of TUSC2 in lung cancer has been well established, and TUSC2 restoration is being evaluated clinically. However, we are highly encouraged by our preclinical programs expanding the potential use of REQORSA to treat a variety of cancer indications, where patient populations have unmet medical needs.”\n\nGenprex has filed two provisional patent applications based on data from two of the presentations. One application involves using REQORSA to treat mesothelioma and the other uses REQORSA to treat glioblastoma. Genprex is a co-owner of the applications along with the respective institutions. TUSC2 is the tumor suppressor gene used in REQORSA. Last month, Genprex announced the formation of its [Mesothelioma Clinical Advisory Board](https://www.genprex.com/2024/09/19/genprex-announces-formation-of-mesothelioma-clinical-advisory-board/) to support the Company’s preclinical mesothelioma oncology program. The Board is comprised of four world-renown researchers from major research institutions specializing in the treatment of mesothelioma. \n\nFeatured Genprex-supported posters presented at the [2024 EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics](https://cm.eortc.org/cmPortal/Searchable/ena2024/config/Normal#!abstractlist) include:\n\n**Title:** [“TUSC2 Gene Therapy in KRASG12C Mutant NSCLC Overcomes Acquired Resistance to Sotorasib”](https://www.genprex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AACR-EORTC-NCI-2024_Poster_Tusc2-overcomes-sotorasib-resistance_Final.pdf)\n\n**Collaborator:** The University of TexasMD Anderson Cancer Center\n\n**Catalog Number:** 384\n\n**Presentation Number:** PB372\n\n**Title:**[“TUSC2 Suppresses Tumorigenic Properties in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Cells”](https://www.genprex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/364_Dr.Goparaju.pdf)\n\n**Collaborator:** New York University Langone Health\n\n**Catalog Number:** 364\n\n**Presentation Number:** PB352\n\n**Title:**[“Efficacy of Quaratusugene Ozeplasmid (REQORSA) TUSC2 Gene Therapy in Glioblastoma”](https://www.genprex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENA24-0125-130_Lo.pdf)\n\n**Collaborator:** The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston\n\n**Catalog Number:** 130\n\n**Presentation Number:** PB118\n\nTo review the posters in detail, please visit [Genprex’s website](https://www.genprex.com/investors/downloads/), where they are available to download.\n\n**About Reqorsa® Gene Therapy**\n\nREQORSA (quaratusugene ozeplasmid) consists of a plasmid containing the TUSC2 gene encapsulated in non-viral lipid-based nanoparticles in a lipoplex form (the Company’s Oncoprex® Delivery System), which has a positive charge. REQORSA is injected intravenously and specifically targets cancer cells. REQORSA is designed to deliver the functioning TUSC2 gene to negatively charged cancer cells while minimizing uptake by normal tissue. Laboratory studies conducted at MD Anderson show that the uptake of TUSC2 in tumor cells in vitro after REQORSA treatment was 10 to 33 times the uptake in normal cells.\n\n**About Genprex, Inc.**\n\nGenprex, Inc. is a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing therapies for patients with cancer and diabetes.
