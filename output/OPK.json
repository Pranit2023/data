(NASDAQ: OPK)** reports business highlights and financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nHighlights from the third quarter of 2024 and recent weeks include the following:\n\n  * **Completed sale of select assets of BioReference Health to Labcorp for $237.5 million**. OPKO completed the sale of BioReference Health’s laboratory testing businesses focused on clinical diagnostics and women’s health, excluding operations in New York and New Jersey, for $237.5 million. BioReference Health will continue to offer oncology and urology diagnostic services nationwide, as well as maintain its full operations in New York and New Jersey. This transaction streamlines BioReference Health’s laboratory services business while retaining its core operations to better position the division for sustained growth and profitability. Net sales from operations continuing at BioReference Health exceeded $400 million in 2023. \n  * **Entered into a $250 million note purchase agreement with HealthCare Royalty secured by profit share payments related to NGENLA.** Under the terms of the note purchase agreement, in the near term OPKO retains a significant portion of the profit share payments from Pfizer received pursuant to its license agreement relating to NGENLA with upside over the long term, as well as the full $100 million of remaining potential milestone payments. \n  * **OPKO’s Board of Directors authorized a $100 million share repurchase program.** Under the program, OPKO may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time through open-market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase transactions and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The Company repurchased and retired 14.9 million shares for approximately $23.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and thereafter, through November 6, 2024 repurchased and retired an additional 8.7 million shares for approximately $13.0 million. In addition, the Company repurchased approximately $3.5 million in principal of its Convertible Notes. \n  * **Enrollment and dosing underway in the MDX2001 Phase 1 trial for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.** MDX2001**,** a tetraspecific antibody, is designed to optimize T-cell function while preventing tumor antigen escape. This Phase 1 open-label trial is expected to enroll up to 45 patients at four clinical trial sites. The Phase 1a portion is primarily designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ascending doses of MDX2001 in patients with various solid tumors. \n  * **Awarded $51 million of additional funding under an existing BARDA contract to develop COVID multispecific antibodies and to initiate an influenza program**. ModeX Therapeutics was awarded $26.9 million of additional funding under an existing contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). This funding will support the development of a second novel multispecific antibody to SARS-CoV-2 from preclinical through Phase 1 trials, as well as preclinical work on gene-based expression of multispecific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 including mRNA and/or DNA vectors. In addition, BARDA activated an option for the second phase of funding totaling $24.1 million for ModeX to begin development of influenza multispecifics with gene and/or protein delivery modalities. Together, these funds bring the total support awarded to ModeX to $110 million, with up to $205 million in total, if all options are executed. \n  * **Announced promising results of an orally delivered oxyntomodulin analog.** OPKO is continuing to progress development of its long-acting oxyntomodulin analog in both its subcutaneous and oral formulations. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) linked peptide was studied and progressed to Phase 2 clinical trials before it was suspended due to dose limiting its formulation. The same key peptide as an acylated compound, OPK-88006, has been confirmed in in vitro assays and animal disease models to be a strong candidate for once-weekly subcutaneous administration. Entera and OPKO recently announced results from their ongoing collaborative research combining OPK-88006 and Entera’s proprietary N-Tab™ technology. The program is focused on developing the first oral dual-agonist GLP-1/glucagon peptide as a potential once-daily treatment for patients with obesity and metabolic disorders. In vivo studies in rodent and pig models showed single dose administration, delivered orally, resulted in a desirable PK profile and bioavailability. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\n  * **Consolidated:** Consolidated total revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $173.6 million compared with $178.6 million for the comparable period of 2023. Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $14.2 million compared with operating loss of $64.4 million for the 2023 quarter. The third quarter of 2024 included a gain of $121.5 million from the sale of certain BioReference assets and a gain of $10.5 million from the sale of shares of GeneDx, as well as non-cash other income of $35.4 million compared with non-cash other expense of $8.3 million in the year-ago quarter related to the change in the fair value of the GeneDx Holdings investment. As a result, net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $24.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $84.5 million, or $0.11 per share, for the 2023 quarter. \n  * **Pharmaceuticals:** Revenue from products in the third quarter of 2024 was $39.1 million compared with $40.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting lower Rayaldee sales and foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Revenue from sales of Rayaldee was $5.8 million compared with $7.3 million in the same period in 2023. Revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other was $13.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with $6.2 million in the 2023 period, primarily attributable to $5.5 million related to the BARDA contract. Gross profit share and royalty payments for NGENLA and Pfizer's Genotropin was $7.0 million in the 2024 quarter compared with $4.9 million in the same period for 2023. Total costs and expenses increased to $84.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $72.3 million in the prior-year period primarily due to higher research and development expenses related to increased activity within the ModeX development programs. Operating loss was $32.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, which included $18.0 million of depreciation and amortization expense, compared with $25.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, which included $17.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense. \n  * **Diagnostics:** Revenue from services in the third quarter of 2024 was $121.3 million compared with $131.7 million in the prior-year period, with the decrease primarily due to lower clinical test volume, principally as a result of the Labcorp transaction and a reduction in reimbursement rates. Total costs and expenses, net of the gain on the sale of assets, were $62.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with $160.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in costs and expenses were primarily attributable to a $121.5 million gain on the Labcorp transaction, partially offset by severance expense of $26.3 million and costs related to the closure of an office building, which reflect the continued progress with cost-reduction initiatives. The third quarter of 2024 included revenue from services of approximately $19.9 million and total costs and expenses of approximately $31.7 million related to [assets acquired by Labcorp](https://www.opko.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/505/labcorp-completes-acquisition-of-select-assets-of-bioreference-healths-diagnostics-business-from-opko-health \"Opens in a new window\"). Operating income was $58.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with a loss of $29.1 million in the 2023 period and included $6.1 million and $8.4 million of depreciation and amortization expense, respectively. \n  * **Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash:** Cash and cash equivalents were $400.1 million, marketable securities, principally shares of GeneDx were $92.2 million and restricted cash and escrow was $43.7 million (including $6.3 million of current restricted cash) as of September 30, 2024. In the third quarter, OPKO entered into a $250 million note purchase agreement secured by OPKO’s profit share payments to be received from Pfizer relating to NGENLA. In addition, OPKO received $237.5 million upon closing of the Labcorp transaction, of which $23.7 million was deposited in an escrow account and will be released upon the one-year anniversary of the transaction close less any outstanding adjustments or claims. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nOPKO’s senior management will provide a business update, discuss third quarter financial results, provide financial guidance and answer questions during a conference call and live audio webcast today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time.

(NASDAQ: OPK)** reports business highlights and financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nHighlights from the third quarter of 2024 and recent weeks include the following:\n\n  * **Completed sale of select assets of BioReference Health to Labcorp for $237.5 million**. OPKO completed the sale of BioReference Health’s laboratory testing businesses focused on clinical diagnostics and women’s health, excluding operations in New York and New Jersey, for $237.5 million. BioReference Health will continue to offer oncology and urology diagnostic services nationwide, as well as maintain its full operations in New York and New Jersey. This transaction streamlines BioReference Health’s laboratory services business while retaining its core operations to better position the division for sustained growth and profitability. Net sales from operations continuing at BioReference Health exceeded $400 million in 2023. \n  * **Entered into a $250 million note purchase agreement with HealthCare Royalty secured by profit share payments related to NGENLA.** Under the terms of the note purchase agreement, in the near term OPKO retains a significant portion of the profit share payments from Pfizer received pursuant to its license agreement relating to NGENLA with upside over the long term, as well as the full $100 million of remaining potential milestone payments. \n  * **OPKO’s Board of Directors authorized a $100 million share repurchase program.** Under the program, OPKO may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time through open-market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase transactions and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The Company repurchased and retired 14.9 million shares for approximately $23.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and thereafter, through November 6, 2024 repurchased and retired an additional 8.7 million shares for approximately $13.0 million. In addition, the Company repurchased approximately $3.5 million in principal of its Convertible Notes. \n  * **Enrollment and dosing underway in the MDX2001 Phase 1 trial for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.** MDX2001**,** a tetraspecific antibody, is designed to optimize T-cell function while preventing tumor antigen escape. This Phase 1 open-label trial is expected to enroll up to 45 patients at four clinical trial sites. The Phase 1a portion is primarily designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ascending doses of MDX2001 in patients with various solid tumors. \n  * **Awarded $51 million of additional funding under an existing BARDA contract to develop COVID multispecific antibodies and to initiate an influenza program**. ModeX Therapeutics was awarded $26.9 million of additional funding under an existing contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). This funding will support the development of a second novel multispecific antibody to SARS-CoV-2 from preclinical through Phase 1 trials, as well as preclinical work on gene-based expression of multispecific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 including mRNA and/or DNA vectors. In addition, BARDA activated an option for the second phase of funding totaling $24.1 million for ModeX to begin development of influenza multispecifics with gene and/or protein delivery modalities. Together, these funds bring the total support awarded to ModeX to $110 million, with up to $205 million in total, if all options are executed. \n  * **Announced promising results of an orally delivered oxyntomodulin analog.** OPKO is continuing to progress development of its long-acting oxyntomodulin analog in both its subcutaneous and oral formulations. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) linked peptide was studied and progressed to Phase 2 clinical trials before it was suspended due to dose limiting its formulation. The same key peptide as an acylated compound, OPK-88006, has been confirmed in in vitro assays and animal disease models to be a strong candidate for once-weekly subcutaneous administration. Entera and OPKO recently announced results from their ongoing collaborative research combining OPK-88006 and Entera’s proprietary N-Tab™ technology. The program is focused on developing the first oral dual-agonist GLP-1/glucagon peptide as a potential once-daily treatment for patients with obesity and metabolic disorders. In vivo studies in rodent and pig models showed single dose administration, delivered orally, resulted in a desirable PK profile and bioavailability. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\n  * **Consolidated:** Consolidated total revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $173.6 million compared with $178.6 million for the comparable period of 2023. Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $14.2 million compared with operating loss of $64.4 million for the 2023 quarter. The third quarter of 2024 included a gain of $121.5 million from the sale of certain BioReference assets and a gain of $10.5 million from the sale of shares of GeneDx, as well as non-cash other income of $35.4 million compared with non-cash other expense of $8.3 million in the year-ago quarter related to the change in the fair value of the GeneDx Holdings investment. As a result, net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $24.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $84.5 million, or $0.11 per share, for the 2023 quarter. \n  * **Pharmaceuticals:** Revenue from products in the third quarter of 2024 was $39.1 million compared with $40.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting lower Rayaldee sales and foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Revenue from sales of Rayaldee was $5.8 million compared with $7.3 million in the same period in 2023. Revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other was $13.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with $6.2 million in the 2023 period, primarily attributable to $5.5 million related to the BARDA contract. Gross profit share and royalty payments for NGENLA and Pfizer's Genotropin was $7.0 million in the 2024 quarter compared with $4.9 million in the same period for 2023. Total costs and expenses increased to $84.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $72.3 million in the prior-year period primarily due to higher research and development expenses related to increased activity within the ModeX development programs. Operating loss was $32.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, which included $18.0 million of depreciation and amortization expense, compared with $25.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, which included $17.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense. \n  * **Diagnostics:** Revenue from services in the third quarter of 2024 was $121.3 million compared with $131.7 million in the prior-year period, with the decrease primarily due to lower clinical test volume, principally as a result of the Labcorp transaction and a reduction in reimbursement rates. Total costs and expenses, net of the gain on the sale of assets, were $62.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with $160.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in costs and expenses were primarily attributable to a $121.5 million gain on the Labcorp transaction, partially offset by severance expense of $26.3 million and costs related to the closure of an office building, which reflect the continued progress with cost-reduction initiatives. The third quarter of 2024 included revenue from services of approximately $19.9 million and total costs and expenses of approximately $31.7 million related to [assets acquired by Labcorp](https://www.opko.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/505/labcorp-completes-acquisition-of-select-assets-of-bioreference-healths-diagnostics-business-from-opko-health \"Opens in a new window\"). Operating income was $58.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with a loss of $29.1 million in the 2023 period and included $6.1 million and $8.4 million of depreciation and amortization expense, respectively. \n  * **Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash:** Cash and cash equivalents were $400.1 million, marketable securities, principally shares of GeneDx were $92.2 million and restricted cash and escrow was $43.7 million (including $6.3 million of current restricted cash) as of September 30, 2024. In the third quarter, OPKO entered into a $250 million note purchase agreement secured by OPKO’s profit share payments to be received from Pfizer relating to NGENLA. In addition, OPKO received $237.5 million upon closing of the Labcorp transaction, of which $23.7 million was deposited in an escrow account and will be released upon the one-year anniversary of the transaction close less any outstanding adjustments or claims. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nOPKO’s senior management will provide a business update, discuss third quarter financial results, provide financial guidance and answer questions during a conference call and live audio webcast today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time.

Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations, beliefs or intentions regarding our product development efforts, business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, strategies or prospects, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that\nthese statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results\nas of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and\nuncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

Delaware corporation (“OPKO”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a diversified healthcare company that seeks to establish industry\nleading positions in large and rapidly growing medical markets. Our pharmaceutical business features Rayaldee, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved\ntreatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism (“SHPT”) in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (“CKD”) and vitamin D insufficiency, and Somatrogon (hGH-\nCTP), a once-weekly human growth hormone injection. We have partnered with Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) for the development and commercialization of Somatrogon (hGH-\nCTP). Regulatory approvals for Somatrogon (hGH-CTP) for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children and adolescents have been secured in more than 50\nmarkets, including the United States, European Union (“EU”) Member States, Japan, Canada, and Australia, where it is marketed under the brand name NGENLA®.\nThrough our 2022 acquisition of ModeX Therapeutics, Inc. (“ModeX”), we have expanded our pharmaceutical pipeline with early-stage immune therapies targeting cancer\nand infectious diseases.\nOur diagnostics business, BioReference Health, LLC (“BioReference”), is a highly specialized laboratory in the United States, with a sales and marketing team\nfocused on growth and new product integration, including the 4Kscore® prostate cancer test. BioReference® offers a broad spectrum of diagnostic testing services for\noncology, urology (4Kscore), and corrections nationwide, setting new standards with our industry-leading turnaround times. BioReference also provides comprehensive\nclinical and women’s health testing in New York and New Jersey. Our test offerings are backed by a team of board-certified medical professionals and driven by the latest\nhealthcare guidelines and standards- marketed directly to physicians, geneticists, hospitals, clinics, correctional facilities, and other healthcare providers. On September 16,\n2024 we consummated the sale of certain assets of BioReference to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (\"Labcorp\"), as described below.\nThe Company maintains established, revenue-generating pharmaceutical platforms in Spain, Ireland, Chile, and Mexico, contributing to positive cash flow and\nfacilitating market entry for our development pipeline. In addition to these platforms, we operate a global pharmaceutical development and commercial supply company, a\nglobal supply chain operation, and manufacture specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in Israel through our subsidiary, FineTech.\nOur management team possesses extensive industry experience in development, regulatory affairs, and commercialization. Their industry relationships support the\nidentification and pursuit of commercial opportunities. Research and development activities are primarily conducted in facilities located in Weston, Massachusetts,\nWaterford, Ireland, Kiryat Gat, Israel, and Barcelona, Spain.\nOn March 27, 2024, the Company and BioReference entered into a definitive agreement with Labcorp (the “Labcorp Asset Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which\nLabcorp acquired select assets of BioReference (the “BioReference Transaction”). The BioReference Transaction closed on September 16, 2024, and upon closing, Labcorp\npaid to the Company aggregate consideration of $237.5 million in cash, which is subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Labcorp Asset Purchase Agreement. These\nassets were part of our diagnostics segment and include BioReference's laboratory testing businesses focused on clinical diagnostics, reproductive health, and women's\nhealth across the United States, excluding BioReference's New York and New Jersey operations.\nPursuant to the Labcorp Asset Purchase Agreement, a total of approximately $23.7 million was withheld at closing and deposited by Labcorp into an escrow account\nwith an escrow account to satisfy potential indemnity claims. The escrow will be released to the Company on the twelve-month anniversary of the closing date, subject to\nany outstanding or liquidated indemnity claims. The Company recorded the escrow within other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe recognized a gain of $121.5 million from the BioReference Transaction for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n12\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 2 FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nApproximately 22.3% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (USD). This\ncompares to 30.7% for the same period in 2023. Our financial statements are reported in USD; therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates affect the translation of foreign-\ndenominated revenue and expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our most significant currency exchange rate\nexposures were to the Euro and the Chilean Peso. Gross accumulated currency translation adjustments, recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, totaled\n$36.2 million and $34.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nWe are subject to foreign currency transaction risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a transaction is initiated and settled. To mitigate this risk,\nwe use foreign currency forward contracts. These contracts fix an exchange rate, allowing us to offset potential losses (or gains) caused by exchange rate changes at the\nsettlement date. As of September 30, 2024, we held no open foreign exchange forward contracts related to inventory purchases on letters of credit. As of December 31,\n2023, we held 52 open foreign exchange forward contracts related to inventory purchases on letters of credit. These contracts matured monthly through January 2024 with a\ntotal notional value of approximately $2.9 million.\nNOTE 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all information and\nnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments or adjustments\notherwise disclosed herein) considered necessary to present fairly the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. The results of\noperations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations and cash flows that may be reported for\nthe remainder of 2024 or any other future periods. The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nPrinciples of consolidation. The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of OPKO Health, Inc. and our wholly-\nowned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash include short-term, interest-bearing instruments with original maturities of 90\ndays or less at the date of purchase. We also consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of 90 days or less as cash equivalents.\nThese investments include money markets, bank deposits, certificates of deposit and U.S. treasury securities.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet to the sum\nof such amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 400,079 $ 95,881\nRestricted cash, current 6,321 —\nRestricted cash, long-term 13,665 —\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows $ 420,065 $ 95,881\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe Company classifies cash deposits related to letters of credit securing insurance and lease obligations as restricted cash, which is included in other assets, non-\ncurrent, within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nInventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. We consider such factors as the\namount of inventory on hand, estimated time required to sell such inventories, remaining shelf-life, and current market conditions to determine whether inventories are\nstated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventories at our diagnostics segment consist primarily of purchased laboratory supplies, which are used in our testing\nlaboratories. Inventory obsolescence expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Inventory\nobsolescence expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $2.6 million and $4.0 million, respectively.\nGoodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired accounted for by\nthe acquisition method of accounting. Refer to Note 5. Goodwill, in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) and other intangible assets acquired in business\ncombinations, licensing and other transactions was $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, licensing and other transactions are generally recognized at the date of acquisition at their\nrespective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. At acquisition, we generally\ndetermine the fair value of intangible assets, including IPR&D, using the “income method.”\nSubsequent to their acquisition, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested at least annually as of October 1 for impairment, or when events or changes\nin circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\nEstimating the fair value of a reporting unit for goodwill impairment is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions and changes in assumptions could\npotentially lead to impairment. We perform sensitivity analyses around our assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the results of our\ntesting. Ultimately, potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and result in an impairment if the fair value of such\nreporting unit is less than its carrying value. Goodwill was $535.9 million and $598.3 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNet intangible assets other than goodwill were $836.4 million on each of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, with IPR&D accounting for $195.0 million\non each date. Considering the high risk nature of research and development and the industry’s success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, IPR&D\nimpairment charges may occur in future periods. Estimating the fair value of IPR&D for potential impairment is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions\nand changes in assumptions could potentially lead to impairment.\nUpon regulatory approval, IPR&D assets are classified as finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are then amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated\nuseful lives. If a project is abandoned, the associated IPR&D costs are immediately expensed. We also regularly assess finite-lived intangible assets for impairment. This\nassessment involves comparing the carrying amount of an asset, which is its cost minus accumulated amortization, to its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the\ncarrying amount exceeds the estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized to reflect the difference between the asset's carrying amount and its fair value.\n14\nTable of Contents\nWhile we believe our estimates and assumptions used in impairment testing (including for goodwill and IPR&D) are reasonable and reflect those used by market\nparticipants, there is a potential risk of material impairment charges. Based on the current financial performance of our diagnostics segment and our Ireland reporting unit\n(which includes Eirgen and Rayaldee), we could be subject to such charges if their future performance deviates from our current estimates and assumptions. For reference,\nthe combined goodwill of these units totaled $304.9 million and $367.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nWe amortize intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 20 years. We use the straight-line method\nof amortization as there is no reliably determinable pattern in which the economic benefits of our intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up. Amortization\nexpense was $20.4 million and $62.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Amortization expense was $21.5 million and $64.5\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nFair value measurements. The carrying amounts of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate\ntheir fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Investments that are considered equity securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are\npredominately carried at fair value. Our debt under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) approximates fair value due to the variable rate of interest applicable to such\ndebt.\nIn evaluating the fair value information, considerable judgment is required to interpret the market data used to develop the estimates. The use of different market\nassumptions and/or different valuation techniques may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value presented herein\nmay not be indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. Refer to Note 9.\nContingent consideration. Each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain prior acquisitions to their fair value and record\nincreases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and decreases in the fair value as a reduction in contingent consideration expense. Changes in contingent\nconsideration result from changes in the assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of related milestones, the estimated timing in which the milestones\nare achieved and the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the liability. Contingent consideration may change significantly as our development programs progress,\nrevenue estimates evolve and additional data is obtained, impacting our assumptions. The assumptions used in estimating fair value require significant judgment. The use of\ndifferent assumptions and judgments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value which may have a material impact on our results from operations and\nfinancial position.\nDerivative financial instruments. We record derivative financial instruments on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value and recognize the\nchanges in the fair value in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations when they occur, the only exception being derivatives that qualify as hedges. For a\nderivative instrument to qualify as a hedge, we are required to meet strict hedge effectiveness and contemporaneous documentation requirements at the initiation of the\nhedge and assess the hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis over the life of the hedge. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our foreign currency forward\ncontracts held to economically hedge inventory purchases did not meet the documentation requirements to be designated as hedges. Accordingly, we recognized all changes\nin the fair values of our derivatives instruments, net, in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Refer to Note 10. In addition, we have determined the value\nof the embedded derivative liability within the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes (as defined in Note 7) and recorded it at fair value. Refer to Note 7. The changes in the fair\nvalue of the embedded derivatives are recognized in the fair value changes of derivatives instruments, net. Refer to Note 9.\nProperty, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost or fair value if acquired in a business combination. Depreciation is provided using\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and includes amortization expense for assets capitalized under finance leases. The estimated useful lives\nby asset class are as follows: software - 3 years, machinery, medical and other equipment - 5-8 years, furniture and fixtures - 5-12 years, leasehold improvements - the lesser\nof their useful life or the lease term, buildings and improvements - 10-40 years, and automobiles - 3-5 years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to\nexpense as incurred. Assets held under finance leases are included within Property, plant and equipment, net in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are\namortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the expected term of their related leases. Depreciation expense was $3.7 million and $11.9 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Depreciation expense was $4.8 million and $14.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nrespectively.\n15\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of long-lived assets. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and assets held for sale, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes\nin circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the\ncarrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated\nfuture cash flows, then an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nIncome taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences\nattributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences\nare expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the\nenactment date. We periodically evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. Our tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur\nto warrant such adjustment. Valuation allowances on certain U.S. deferred tax assets and non-U.S. deferred tax assets are established, because realization of these tax\nbenefits through future taxable income does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold.\nWe operate in various countries and tax jurisdictions globally. For interim reporting purposes, we record income taxes based on the expected effective income tax\nrate, taking into consideration year to date and global forecasted tax results. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the tax rate differed from the U.S. federal\nstatutory rate of 21% primarily due to the valuation allowance against certain U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets, the relative mix in earnings and losses in the U.S.\nversus foreign tax jurisdictions, and the impact of certain discrete tax events and operating results in tax jurisdictions which do not result in a tax benefit.\nIncluded in Other long-term liabilities is an accrual of $9.9 million related to uncertain tax positions involving income recognition. In connection with an examination\nof foreign tax returns for the 2015 through 2021 tax years, a foreign taxing authority has issued an income tax assessment of approximately $246 million (including\ninterest). We are appealing this assessment, as we believe, other than for uncertain tax positions for which we have reserved, the issues are without technical merit. We\nintend to exhaust all judicial remedies necessary to resolve the matter as necessary, which could be a lengthy process. There can be no assurance that this matter will be\nresolved in our favor, and an adverse outcome, or any future tax examinations involving similar assertions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nRevenue recognition. We recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\nTopic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange\nfor those goods or services. We apply the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the\nperformance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v)\nrecognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation.\nWe apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we\ntransfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we review the contract to determine which performance\nobligations we must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the\nrespective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. For a complete discussion of accounting for Revenues from services,\nRevenues from products and Revenue from transfer of intellectual property and other, refer to Note 13.\nConcentration of credit risk and allowance for credit losses. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of\naccounts receivable. Substantially all of our accounts receivable are with either companies in the healthcare industry or patients. However, credit risk is limited due to the\nnumber of our clients as well as their dispersion across many different geographic regions.\nWhile we have receivables due from federal and state governmental agencies, such receivables are not a credit risk because federal and state governments fund the\nrelated healthcare programs. Payment is primarily dependent upon submitting appropriate documentation. On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, receivable\nbalances (net of explicit and implicit price concessions) from Medicare and Medicaid were 6.5% and 6.7%, respectively, of our consolidated Accounts receivable, net. The\nportion of our accounts receivable due from individual patients comprises the largest portion of credit risk. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, receivables due\nfrom patients represented approximately 2.2% and 2.0%, respectively, of our consolidated Accounts receivable, net.\n16\nTable of Contents\nWe assess the collectability of accounts receivable balances by considering factors such as historical collection experience, customer credit worthiness, the age of\naccounts receivable balances, regulatory changes and current economic conditions and trends that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. The allowance for credit losses was $2.0 million on each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The credit loss expense for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, was a reversal expense of $75.2 thousand and $67.5 thousand of expense, respectively. The credit loss expense for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, was $98.3 thousand and $183.4 thousand, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, accounts receivable included $1.6 million of revenue earned under the BARDA Contract (as defined in Note 14). As of December 31,\n2023, accounts receivable included $0.6 million under this contract. Refer to Note 13, Government Contract Revenue for further information on government contracts and\nto Note 14, Strategic Alliances for further information on the BARDA Contract.\nStock Repurchase Program. On July 18, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million shares of\nCommon Stock. Under this program, OPKO may repurchase shares through various methods, including open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated\ntransactions, and accelerated share repurchases, as well as pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act, and otherwise\nin compliance with applicable laws. The timing and volume of repurchases will depend on market conditions, the Company's capital management, investment opportunities,\nand other factors. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares, has no set expiration date, and may be modified, suspended, or\ndiscontinued at the Company's discretion. The Company repurchased 14,893,026 shares for approximately $23.8 million during the three months ended September 30,\n2024.\nEquity-based compensation. We measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nThat cost is recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the\naward. We record excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options as cash flows from operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nwe recorded $2.8 million and $8.0 million, respectively, of equity-based compensation expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded $3.2\nmillion and $8.7 million, respectively, of equity-based compensation expense.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses include external and internal expenses. External expenses include clinical and nonclinical\nactivities performed by contract research organizations, lab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. Research\nand development employee-related expenses include salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses are\nincurred to support overall research and development activities and include expenses related to general overhead and facilities. We expense these costs in the period in\nwhich they are incurred. We estimate our liabilities for research and development expenses in order to match the recognition of expenses to the period in which the actual\nservices are received. As such, accrued liabilities related to third party research and development activities are recognized based upon our estimate of services received and\ndegree of completion of the services in accordance with the specific third party contract.\nResearch and development expense includes costs for in-process research and development projects acquired in asset acquisitions which have not reached\ntechnological feasibility, and which have no alternative future use. For in-process research and development projects acquired in business combinations, the in-process\nresearch and development project is capitalized and evaluated for impairment until the development process has been completed. Once the development process has been\ncompleted the asset will be amortized over its remaining estimated useful life.\nSegment reporting. Our chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) is Phillip Frost, M.D., our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Frost reviews our operating\nresults and operating plans and makes resource allocation decisions on a Company-wide or aggregate basis. We manage our operations in two reportable segments,\npharmaceutical and diagnostics. The pharmaceutical segment consists of our pharmaceutical operations in Chile, Mexico, Ireland, Israel and Spain, Rayaldee product sales\nand our pharmaceutical research and development. The diagnostics segment primarily consists of clinical laboratory operations through BioReference and our point-of-care\noperations. There are no significant inter-segment sales. We evaluate the performance of each segment based on operating profit or loss. There is no inter-segment allocation\nof interest expense or income taxes. Refer to Note 15.\nShipping and handling costs. We do not charge customers for shipping and handling costs. Shipping and handling costs are classified as Cost of revenues in the\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n17\nTable of Contents\nForeign currency translation. The financial statements of certain of our foreign operations are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. The local\ncurrency assets and liabilities are generally translated at the rate of exchange to the U.S. dollar on the balance sheet date. The local currency revenues and expenses are\ntranslated at average rates of exchange to the U.S. dollar during the reporting periods. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) have been reflected as a component of\nOther income (expense), net within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and foreign currency translation gains (losses) have been included as a component\nof the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded foreign currency\ntransaction income of $4.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded foreign currency transaction\nloss of $3.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively.\nVariable interest entities. The consolidation of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) is required when an enterprise has a controlling financial interest. A controlling\nfinancial interest in a VIE will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic\nperformance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Refer to Note 6.\nInvestments. We have made strategic investments in development stage and emerging companies. We record these investments as equity method investments or as\nequity securities based on our percentage of ownership and whether we have significant influence over the operations of the investees. For investments classified under the\nequity method of accounting, we record our proportionate share of their losses in Losses from investments in investees in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of\nOperations. Refer to Note 6. For investments classified as equity securities, we record changes in their fair value as Other income (expense) in our Condensed Consolidated\nStatement of Operations based on their closing price per share at the end of each reporting period, unless the equity security does not have a readily determinable fair value.\nRefer to Note 6.\nAccounting standards yet to be adopted.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which modifies\nthe rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (i) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (ii) the income or loss from continuing operations before\nincome tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (iii) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and\nforeign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state, and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The\nguidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or\nmade available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential\nimpact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU\n2023-07 enhances disclosures for significant segment expenses for all public entities required to report segment information in accordance with ASC 280. ASC 280 requires\na public entity to report for each reportable segment a measure of segment profit or loss that its CODM uses to assess segment performance and to make decisions about\nresource allocations. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with updates to be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the\nstandard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures.\nRecently adopted accounting standards.\nIn 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) established an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and agreed\non a two-pillar solution (“Pillar Two”) to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation and a 15% global minimum effective tax rate. On December 15, 2022, the EU\nmember states agreed to implement the OECD’s global minimum tax rate of 15%. The OECD issued Pillar Two model rules and continues to release guidance on these\nrules. The inclusive framework calls for tax law changes by participating countries to take effect in 2024 and 2025. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans\nto enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax. We considered the applicable tax law changes on Pillar Two implementation in the relevant countries, and there\nis no material impact to our tax results for the period. We anticipate further legislative activity and administrative guidance in 2024, and will continue to evaluate the\nimpacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in the non-US tax jurisdictions we operate in.\n18\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 4 EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing our net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding during the\nperiod. Shares of Common Stock outstanding under the share lending arrangement entered into in conjunction with the 2025 Notes (as defined in Note 7) have been\nexcluded from the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share because the borrower of the shares is required under the share lending arrangement to refund any\ndividends paid on the shares lent. We terminated the share lending agreement on January 22, 2024. Refer to Note 7. For diluted earnings per share, the dilutive impact of\nstock options and warrants is determined by applying the “treasury stock” method. The dilutive impact of the 2029 Convertible Notes, 2033 Senior Notes, the 2023\nConvertible Notes and the 2025 Notes (each, as defined and discussed in Note 7) has been considered using the “if converted” method.

We\namortize intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives by asset class are as follows: technologies -\n7-17 years, customer relationships - 5-20 years, product registrations - 7-10 years, covenants not to compete - 5 years, trade names - 5-10 years, other 9-13 years. We do not\nanticipate capitalizing the cost of product registration renewals, rather we expect to expense these costs, as incurred. Our goodwill is not tax deductible for income tax\npurposes in any jurisdiction in which we operate.\nChanges in value of the intangible assets and goodwill during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily due to foreign currency\nfluctuations between the Euro, and the Chilean Peso against the U.S. dollar.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Goodwill by reporting unit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n2024\nCumulative\nGross goodwill at impairment at January Acquisitions, Foreign exchange and Balance at September\n(In thousands) January 1, 2024 1 dispositions and other other 30, 2024\nPharmaceuticals\nCURNA $ 4,827 $ (4,827) $ — $ — $ —\nRayaldee 84,273 — — 925 85,198\nFineTech 11,698 (11,698) — — —\nModeX 80,260 — — — 80,260\nOPKO Biologics 139,784 — — (0) 139,784\nOPKO Chile 3,642 — — (81) 3,561\nOPKO Health Europe 7,276 — — 82 7,358\nOPKO Mexico 100 (100) — — —\nTransition Therapeutics 3,421 (3,421) — — —\nDiagnostics\nBioReference 283,025 — (63,318) — 219,707\nOPKO Diagnostics 17,977 (17,977) — — —\n$ 636,283 $ (38,023) $ (63,318) $ 926 $ 535,868\n21\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 6 INVESTMENTS\nInvestments\nThe following table reflects the accounting method, carrying value and underlying equity in net assets of our unconsolidated investments as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023:\n(in thousands) As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nUnderlying Underlying\nInvestment Equity in Net Investment Equity in Net\nInvestment type Carrying Value Assets Carrying Value Assets\nEquity method investments $ (0) $ 1,782 $ (0) $ 2,942\nVariable interest entity, equity method 790 — 796 420\nEquity method investments - FV option 92,166 9,786\nEquity securities 130 116\nEquity securities with no readily determinable fair value 7,521 5,382\nWarrants and options 2 2\nTotal carrying value of investments $ 100,609 $ 16,082\nEquity method investments\nOur equity method investments, other than in GeneDx Holdings, as described below, consist of investments in Pharmsynthez (ownership 6%), Cocrystal Pharma, Inc.\n(“COCP”) (2%), Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc.

Neovasc, Inc., in which we owned a 0.5% interest, was acquired by Shockwave\nMedical, Inc. in April 2023. As a result, we received $363 thousand in merger consideration in exchange for our shares. The aggregate amount of assets, liabilities, and net\nlosses of these equity method investees as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $66.1 million, $23.3 million, and $27.7 million, respectively. The\naggregate amount of assets, liabilities, and net losses of our equity method investees as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $85.5 million, $20.8 million, and\n$37.7 million, respectively. We have determined that we or our related parties have the ability to exercise significant influence over our equity method investments through\nour board representation or voting power. Accordingly, we account for our investment in these entities under the equity method and record our proportionate share of their\nlosses in Loss from investments in investees in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The aggregate value of our equity method investments based on the quoted\nmarket prices of their respective shares of common stock and the number of shares held by us as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $0.6 million and $0.7\nmillion, respectively.\nEquity method investments - Fair value option\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “GeneDx Merger Agreement”) with GeneDx Holdings\nCorp. (f/k/a Sema4 Holdings Corp.), a Delaware corporation (“GeneDx Holdings”), pursuant to which GeneDx Holdings acquired our former subsidiary, GeneDx LLC\n(formerly GeneDx, Inc. “GeneDx”), on April 28, 2022. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company sold 1,386,929 shares of GeneDx common stock at various prices per\nshare for an aggregate of $46.7 million. As a result of the sale, the Company's total ownership in GeneDx Holdings decreased from 13.61% to 8.1% as of September 30,\n2024.\nPursuant to the GeneDx Merger Agreement, the Company designated, and GeneDx Holdings nominated for election an individual to serve on the board of directors\nof GeneDx Holdings. This individual was subsequently elected by GeneDx Holdings stockholders and has continued to serve on the board following his re-election in 2024.\nHis term will extend until the GeneDx Holdings annual meeting of stockholders in 2027. We have a shareholder agreement with GeneDx Holdings, pursuant to which we\nhave agreed to vote our shares of GeneDx Holdings common stock in accordance with the recommendation of GeneDx Holdings' board of directors for so long as we\ncontinue to hold at least 5% of the outstanding shares of GeneDx Holdings common stock. Other than through our position as a shareholder, we are unable to influence\nGeneDx Holdings' policy-making process.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe account for our investment in GeneDx Holdings under the equity method fair value option and record gains and losses from changes in fair value in other income\n(expense), net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $35.4 million and $118.6\nmillion in net income related to the change in fair value of our GeneDx Holdings investment, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we\nrecognized $8.3 million and $19.9 million in net loss related to the change in fair value of our GeneDx Holdings investment, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the\naggregate value of our GeneDx Holdings investment was $92.2 million based on the quoted market price of the GeneDx Holdings common stock.\nInvestments in equity securities\nOur equity securities consist of investments in VBI Vaccines Inc. (0.00%), ChromaDex Corporation (“ChromaDex”) (0.05%), and Eloxx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n(“Eloxx”) (1%). During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a $30 thousand loss from our investment in VBI Vaccines Inc. due to the company filing for bankruptcy. Our\nequity securities without readily determinable fair value consists of CAMP4 Therapeutics Corporation (“CAMP4”) (2%) and HealthSnap, Inc. (4%). We have determined\nthat our ownership, along with that of our related parties, does not provide us with significant influence over the operations of these investments. Accordingly, we account\nfor our investment in these entities as equity securities, and we record changes in the fair value of these investments in Other income (expense) each reporting period when\nthey have a readily determinable fair value. Equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are adjusted to fair value when there is an observable price change.\nNet gains and losses on our equity securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nFor the nine months ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nEquity Securities:\nNet gains and losses recognized during the period on equity securities $ 43 $ (411)\nLess: Net gains and losses realized during the period on equity securities (30) —\nUnrealized net losses recognized during the period on equity securities still held at the reporting date $ 13 $ (411)\nSales of investments\nGains (losses) included in earnings from sales of our investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of\nOperations. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.\nWarrants and options\nIn addition to our equity method investments and equity securities, we hold options to purchase 47 thousand additional shares of BioCardia, all of which were vested\nas of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and warrants to purchase 0.7 million additional shares of InCellDx Inc. We recorded the changes in the fair value of the\noptions and warrants in fair value changes of derivative instruments, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. We also recorded the fair value of the\noptions and warrants in Investments, net in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. See further discussion of the Company’s options and warrants in Note 9 and Note\n10.\n23\nTable of Contents\nInvestments in variable interest entities\nWe have determined that we hold variable interests in LeaderMed and Zebra. We made this determination as a result of our assessment that they do not have\nsufficient resources to carry out their principal activities without additional financial support.\nIn September 2021, we and LeaderMed, a pharmaceutical development company with operations based in Asia, formed a joint venture to develop, manufacture and\ncommercialize two of OPKO’s clinical stage, long-acting drug products in Greater China and eight other Asian territories. Under the terms of the agreements, we granted\nthe joint venture exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize (a) OPK88003, an oxyntomodulin analog being developed for the treatment of obesity and\ndiabetes, and (b) Factor VIIa-CTP, a novel long acting coagulation factor being developed to treat hemophilia, in exchange for 4,703 shares 47% ownership interest in the\njoint venture. In addition, we received an upfront payment of $1.0 million and will be reimbursed for clinical trial material and technical support we provide the joint\nventure.\nIn order to determine the primary beneficiary of the joint venture, we evaluated our investment and our related parties’ investment, as well as our investment\ncombined with the related parties’ investment to identify if we had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the joint\nventure. Based on the capital structure, governing documents and overall business operations of the joint venture, we determined that, while a VIE, we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture’s economic performance and do not have an obligation to fund expected losses. We did\ndetermine that we can significantly influence control of the joint venture through our board representation and voting power. Therefore, we have the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence over the joint venture’s operations and account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method.\nWe own 1,260,000 shares of Zebra’s Series A-2 Preferred Stock and 900,000 shares of Zebra restricted common stock (ownership 29%) at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. Zebra is a privately held biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of biosuperior antibody therapeutics and complex drugs.\nDr. Richard Lerner, M.D., a former member of our Board of Directors, was a founder of Zebra. Dr. Frost serves as a member of Zebra’s Board of Directors.\nIn order to determine the primary beneficiary of Zebra, we evaluated our investment and our related parties’ investment, as well as our investment combined with the\nrelated parties’ investment to identify if we had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Zebra. Based on the capital\nstructure, governing documents and overall business operations of Zebra, we determined that, while a VIE, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact Zebra’s economic performance and have no obligation to fund expected losses. We determined, however, that we can significantly influence control of\nZebra through our board representation and voting power. Therefore, we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Zebra’s operations and account for our\ninvestment in Zebra under the equity method.\n24\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 7 DEBT\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our debt consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\n2029 Convertible Notes $ 178,645 $ —\n2025 Notes 170 143,250\n2033 Senior Notes 50 50\n2023 Convertible Notes — 71,025\n2044 Notes 245,358 —\nJPMorgan Chase Bank line of credit — 12,671\nChilean and Spanish lines of credit 11,713 12,629\nCurrent portion of notes payable 1,509 1,993\nLong term portion of notes payable 3,529 7,727\nTotal $ 440,974 $ 249,345\nBalance sheet captions\nCurrent portion of convertible notes $ 170 $ —\nLong term portion of convertible notes 178,695 214,325\nCurrent portion of lines of credit and notes payable 13,222 27,293\nLong Term notes payable included in long-term liabilities 248,887 7,727\nTotal $ 440,974 $ 249,345\n2044 Note Purchase Agreement\nOn July 17, 2024, the Company completed a private offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the “2044 Notes”), pursuant to a\nnote purchase agreement dated July 17, 2024 (the “2044 Note Purchase Agreement), by and among the Company, certain purchasers from time to time party thereto, the\nCompany’s wholly owned subsidiaries OPKO Biologics (“OBL”) and EirGen as guarantors (OBL and EirGen collectively, the “2044 Note Guarantors”), and HCR Injection\nSPV, LLC, as agent.\nThe 2044 Notes mature on July 17, 2044 and bear interest at the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) subject to a 4.0% per annum floor, plus 7.5%\nper annum. Interest is payable on the 2044 Notes on a quarterly basis determined by profit share payments received by EirGen pursuant to the profit share arrangement with\nPfizer, Inc. (the “Royalty Payments”) set forth in the Restated Pfizer Agreement (as defined and described in Note 14). In the event that the aggregate amount of the Royalty\nPayments received by EirGen during the quarter preceding any quarterly interest payment date are less than the accrued and unpaid interest payable on such date, the excess\ninterest payable on such date shall be paid-in-kind and added to the outstanding principal amount of the 2044 Notes. The Company will be required to pay the noteholders a\n3% exit fee in connection with any repayment in full of the 2044 Notes, whether at maturity or otherwise. In addition, in the event that the Company repays the 2044 Notes\nin full prior to the maturity date, the Company will be required to pay the noteholders a make whole payment in an amount necessary such that the noteholders shall have\nreceived aggregate payments of principal, interest and fees in respect of the 2044 Notes equal to at least 150% of the initial principal amount of the 2044 Notes, in the event\nthat such prepayment shall occur on or prior to July 17, 2029, or 200% of the initial principal amount of the 2044 Notes, in the event that such prepayment shall occur\nfollowing July 17, 2029. If the 2044 Notes have not been fully repaid by the maturity date, the Company may elect to either repay the unpaid balance of the principal\namount in full, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and the 3% exit fee, or elect to transfer 80% of all future Royalty Payments to the agent and the\nnoteholders in satisfaction of the outstanding 2044 Notes. The Company may authorize up to an additional $50,000,000 in additional 2044 Notes to the purchasers on the\nsame terms and conditions of the initial 2044 Notes. The 2044 Notes are secured by the Royalty Payments, and the 2044 Note Guarantors have guaranteed the obligations\nunder the 2044 Notes by granting a security interest in certain assets of the 2044 Note Guarantors. The 2044 Note Purchase Agreement contains customary terms and\ncovenants, including negative covenants, such as limitations on indebtedness, liens, amendments to certain material contracts and disposition of assets.\n25\nTable of Contents\n2029 Convertible 144A Notes\nIn January 2024, we completed a private offering of $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes\ndue 2029 (the “2029 Convertible 144A Notes”) in accordance with the terms of a note purchase agreement (the “144A Note Purchase Agreement”) entered into by and\nbetween the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (the “Initial Purchaser”).\nNet proceeds from the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes issuance totaled approximately $222.0 million after deducting fees and estimated offering expenses payable by\nus. We allocated approximately $50.0 million of these net proceeds to repurchase shares of our Common Stock. These repurchases were from purchasers of the 2029\nConvertible 144A Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected with or through the Initial Purchaser or its affiliate. The purchase price per share of the Common Stock\nin these transactions equaled the closing sale price of $0.9067 per share of Common Stock on January 4, 2024.\nContemporaneously with the closing of the offering of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes on January 9, 2024, we issued and sold approximately $71.1 million\naggregate principal amount of our 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Convertible Affiliate Notes” and, together with the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes,\nthe “2029 Convertible Notes”) pursuant to the terms of a note purchase agreement entered into on January 4, 2024 (the “Affiliate Note Purchase Agreement”) by and among\nthe Company and certain investors, Frost Gamma Investments Trust, a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, and Dr. Jane H. Hsiao (collectively, the “Affiliate Purchasers”).\nPursuant to the Affiliate Note Purchase Agreement, we issued and sold the 2029 Convertible Affiliate Notes to the Affiliate Purchasers in exchange for the entirety of the\n$55.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2023 Convertible Notes held by the Affiliate Purchasers, together with approximately $16.1 million of accrued\nbut unpaid interest thereon.\nOn January 9th, 2024, we recorded the $125.6 million value of the embedded derivative liability within the 2029 Convertible Notes as a debt discount. To determine\nthe fair value of this derivative, we employed the Binomial Lattice model. Key inputs and assumptions for this valuation included our common stock price, the derivative's\nexercise price, risk-free interest rate, volatility, annual coupon rate, and remaining contractual term. We are amortizing the debt discount as non-cash interest expense over\nthe term of the Notes.\nFrom the date the Notes were issued through March 31, 2024, we observed an increase in the market price of our Common Stock which resulted in a $26.25 million\nincrease in the estimated fair value of our embedded derivatives recorded in Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nOperations. Effective April 1, 2024, the conversion option contained in the 2029 Convertible Notes met the classification of an equity component. As a result, we\nreclassified $151.9 million of the embedded derivative liability from debt, non-current, to additional paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nAs of September 30, 2024 the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes are currently convertible. Holders may convert their 2029 Convertible Notes at their option prior to the\nclose of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2028 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing\nafter the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2024 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock for at least 20 trading days\n(whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is\ngreater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five consecutive business day period after\nany ten consecutive trading day period (the “convertible note measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of\nthe convertible note measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Common Stock and the applicable conversion rate on each\nsuch trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events specified in the indenture governing the 2029 Convertible Notes. On or after September 15,\n2028 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing\nconditions. Upon conversion of a note, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Common\nStock, at our election.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe conversion rate is initially equal to 869.5652 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of\napproximately $1.15 per share of Common Stock). The conversion rate for the 2029 Convertible Notes will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events\nbut will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the notes, in certain\ncircumstances we will increase the conversion rate of the 2029 Convertible Notes for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event.\nWe may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the notes. If we undergo a fundamental change, holders may require us\nto purchase the notes in whole or in part for cash at a fundamental change purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, plus accrued\nand unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The 2029 Convertible Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in\nright of payment to any indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, and equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future\nunsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated. The notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of\nthe assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe indenture governing the notes provides for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among\nothers, the following: nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of covenants or other agreements in the indenture; defaults in failure to pay certain other indebtedness;\njudgment defaults; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs and is continuing under the indenture, the trustee thereunder or\nthe holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding may declare 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any on all\nthen-outstanding notes to be immediately due and payable. In certain circumstances, we may, for a period of time, elect to pay additional interest on the notes as the sole\nremedy to holders of the notes in the case of an event of default related to certain failures by us to comply with certain reporting covenants in the indenture.\nThe following table sets forth information related to the 2029 Convertible Notes which is included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30,\n2024:\n2029 convertible Embedded Debt Issuance\n(In thousands) notes conversion option Discount costs Total\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nIssuance of 3.75% 2029 Convertible Notes 301,054 125,620 (125,620) (8,562) 292,492\nAmortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs — — 12,585 1,236 13,821\nChange in fair value of embedded derivative — 26,250 — — 26,250\nReclassification of embedded derivative to equity — (151,870) — — (151,870)\nRepurchase (3,500) — 1,338 114 (2,048)\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 297,554 $ — $ (111,697) $ (7,212) $ 178,645\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased $3.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes for $4.8 million in cash.\nSuch convertible debt repurchase resulted in a gain of $32 thousand, which included unamortized discount of $1.3 million and debt issuance costs of $0.1 million.\n27\nTable of Contents\n2025 Convertible Notes\nIn February 2019, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) in an underwritten public offering.\nThe 2025 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nWe utilize a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers are: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted\nprices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as\nunobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had equity securities and an equity method fair value option (refer to Note 6), forward foreign currency exchange contracts for\ninventory purchases (refer to Note 10). In addition, in connection with our investment and our consulting agreement with BioCardia, we record the related BioCardia\noptions at fair value as well as warrants from COCP. In addition, restricted cash collateralized by money market funds is a financial asset measured at fair value as a Level\n1 financial instrument under the fair value hierarchy.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOur financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:\nFair value measurements as of September 30, 2024\nQuoted\nprices in\nactive Significant\nmarkets for other Significant\nidentical observable unobservable\nassets inputs inputs\n(In thousands) (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\nAssets:\nMoney market funds $ 354,537 $ — $ — $ 354,537\nEquity securities 130 — — 130\nEquity Method - Fair value option 92,166 — — 92,166\nCommon stock options — 2 — 2\nTotal assets $ 446,833 $ 2 $ — $ 446,835\nFair value measurements as of December 31, 2023\nQuoted\nprices in\nactive Significant\nmarkets for other Significant\nidentical observable unobservable\nassets inputs inputs\n(In thousands) (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\nAssets:\nMoney market funds $ 32,404 $ — $ — $ 32,404\nEquity securities 116 — — $ 116\nEquity Method - fair value option 9,786 — — 9,786\nCommon stock options/warrants — 2 — 2\nTotal assets $ 42,306 $ 2 $ — $ 42,308\nLiabilities:\nForward contracts — 29 — 29\nTotal liabilities $ — $ 29 $ — $ 29\nThe carrying amount and estimated fair value of our 2029 Convertible Notes and 2025 Notes, as well as the applicable fair value hierarchy tiers, are contained in the\ntable below.

Neovasc, Inc.,\nin which we owned a 0.5% interest, was acquired by Shockwave Medical, Inc. in April 2023, and during the third quarter of 2023, we received $363 thousand in merger\nconsideration in exchange for our shares. These investments were considered related party transactions as a result of our executive management’s ownership interests and/or\nboard representation in these entities. We also hold an investment in GeneDx Holdings (Nasdaq: WGS) representing a 8.1% ownership interest as a result of our sale of\nGeneDx, Inc. and subsequent participation in an underwritten offering by GeneDx Holdings. Richard Pfenniger who sits on our Board also sits on the GeneDx Board. See\nfurther discussion of our investments in Note 6.\nDr. Elias Zerhouni, our Vice Chairman and President, sits on the board of directors of Danaher Corporation (“Danaher”). Our subsidiary, BioReference, routinely\nprocures products and services from several subsidiaries of Danaher, including Beckman Coulter, Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., and Leica Microsystems Inc., to which\nBioReference has paid $2.6 million, $3.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nBioReference purchases and uses certain products acquired from InCellDx, a company in which we hold a 29% minority interest.\nWe reimburse Dr. Frost for Company-related use by Dr. Frost and our other executives of an airplane owned by a company that is beneficially owned by Dr. Frost.\nWe reimburse Dr. Frost for out-of-pocket operating costs for the use of the airplane by Dr. Frost or Company executives for Company-related business.

For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we reimbursed and accrued approximately $49.5 thousand and $78.8 thousand, respectively, for Company-related travel by Dr. Frost and other OPKO\nexecutives.\n34\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 12 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nIn February 2023, the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Texas (“TX OAG”) informed BioReference that it believes that, from 2005 to the present,\nBioReference may have violated the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act with respect to claims it presented to Texas Medicaid for reimbursement. BioReference and the\nTX OAG have reached an agreement in principle to settle this matter and are currently negotiating the settlement agreement.\nOn December 29, 2022, the Israel Tax Authority (the “ITA”) issued an assessment against our subsidiary, OPKO Biologics in the amount of approximately\n$246 million (including interest) related to uncertain tax positions involving income recognition in connection with an examination of foreign tax returns for the 2014\nthrough 2020 tax years. We recognize that local tax law is inherently complex and the local taxing authorities may not agree with certain tax positions taken. We are\nappealing this assessment, as we believe, other than for uncertain tax positions for which we have reserved, the issues are without technical merit. We intend to exhaust all\njudicial remedies necessary to resolve the matter, as necessary, which could be a lengthy process. There can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor,\nand an adverse outcome, or any future tax examinations involving similar assertions, could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nThe Company and BioReference entered into (i) a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”), effective July 14, 2022, with the United States of America,\nacting through the United States Department of Justice and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG-HHS”),\nand the Defense Health Agency, acting on behalf of the TRICARE Program (collectively, the “United States”), the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , the State of\nConnecticut, and the relator identified therein (“Relator”), and (ii) a Corporate Integrity Agreement, effective July 14, 2022 (the “CIA”), with the OIG-HHS, to resolve the\ninvestigation and related civil action concerning alleged fee-for-service claims for payment to the Medicare Program, the Medicaid Program, and the TRICARE Program\n(collectively, the “Federal Health Care Programs”).\nUnder the Settlement Agreement, the Company and BioReference admitted only to having made payments to certain physicians and physicians’ groups for office\nspace rentals for amounts that exceeded fair market value, and that it did not report or return any such overpayments to the Federal Health Care Programs (the “Covered\nConduct”). The Covered Conduct had commenced prior to the Company’s acquisition of BioReference in 2015. With the exception of the Covered Conduct, the Company\nand BioReference expressly deny the allegations of the Relator as set forth in her civil action. The Company has paid a total of $10,000,000 plus accrued interest from\nSeptember 24, 2021 at a rate of 1.5% per annum (the “Settlement Amount”). The Settlement Amount consists of $9,853,958 payable to the United States, $141,041 payable\nto the Commonwealth and $5,001 payable to Connecticut, in each case plus interest and was paid on July 18, 2022. Conditioned upon payment of the Settlement Amount,\nthe United States, Massachusetts and Connecticut agreed to release the Company and BioReference from any civil or administrative monetarily liability arising from the\nCovered Conduct. Upon payment of the Settlement Amount and the amount due under a separate agreement with the Relator, the Relator released the Company and\nBioReference from any and all claims and potential claims. Further, in consideration of the obligations of the Company and BioReference in the Settlement Agreement and\nthe CIA, the OIG-HHS released and refrained from instituting any administrative action seeking to exclude the Company or BioReference from participating in Medicare,\nMedicaid or other Federal health care programs as a result of the Covered Conduct.\nUnder the CIA, which has a term of 5 years, BioReference is required to, among other things: (i) maintain a Compliance Officer, a Compliance Committee, board\nreview and oversight of certain federal healthcare compliance matters, compliance programs, and disclosure programs; (ii) provide management certifications and\ncompliance training and education; (iii) establish written compliance policies and procedures to meet federal health care program requirements; (iv) create procedures\ndesigned to ensure compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and/or Stark Law; (v) engage an independent review organization to conduct a thorough review of\nBioReference’ s systems, policies, processes and procedures related to certain arrangements; (vi) implement a risk assessment and internal review process; (vii) establish a\ndisclosure program for whistleblowers; and (viii) report or disclose certain events and physician payments. The Company’s or BioReference’s failure to comply with its\nobligations under the CIA could result in monetary penalties and the exclusion from participation in Federal Health Care Programs. The CIA does not apply to any of the\nCompany’s subsidiaries other than BioReference, and its scope is generally limited to “focus arrangements”, which are those “arrangements” (as defined in the CIA) (i)\nbetween BioReference and any actual source or recipient of health care business or referrals and involves, directly or indirectly, the offer, payment, or provision of anything\nof value, or (ii) is between BioReference and any physician (or a physician’s immediate family member). Most of these measures have already been implemented at\nBioReference. Following its acquisition of BioReference, the Company and BioReference implemented robust compliance measures that substantially align with those\nactions required under the CIA.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOn March 1, 2019, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), Washington, DC. The CID sets forth\ndocument requests and interrogatories in connection with allegations that the Company and certain of its affiliates violated the False Claims Act and/or the Anti-Kickback\nStatute. On January 13, 2022, the Federal Government notified the U.S.D.C., Middle District Florida, Jacksonville Division, that it is declining to intervene in the matter but\nretains the right, via the Attorney General, to consent to any proposed dismissal of the action by the Court. On February 9, 2022, the States of Florida, Georgia, and\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts notified the U.S.D.C., Middle District Florida, Jacksonville Division, that they are declining to intervene in the matter. Notwithstanding\nthe above declinations, on February 17, 2022, the Company was served with the Relator’s Summons and Complaint (“Complaint”), which had been previously sealed. The\nComplaint alleges violations of the False Claims Act, the California Fraud Preventions Act, the Florida False Claims Act, the Massachusetts False Claims Act, the Georgia\nFalse Medicaid Claims Act, and illegal kickbacks. A motion to dismiss the Complaint was filed on April 25, 2022 and the case was dismissed in March 2023. However, the\nRelator filed an amended complaint in April 2023 and a second amended complaint, both of which were dismissed. Relator then filed an appeal in the U.S. Eleventh Circuit\nCourt of Appeals which is pending before the court following a failed mediation in April 2024. While management cannot predict the outcome of these matters at this time,\nthe ultimate outcome could be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we may receive inquiries, document requests, CIDs or subpoenas from the Department of Justice, OCR, CMS, various payors and fiscal\nintermediaries, and other state and federal regulators regarding investigations, audits and reviews. In addition to the matters discussed in this note, we are currently\nresponding to CIDs, subpoenas, payor audits, and document requests for various matters relating to our laboratory operations. Some pending or threatened proceedings\nagainst us may involve potentially substantial amounts as well as the possibility of civil, criminal, or administrative fines, penalties, or other sanctions, which could be\nmaterial. Settlements of suits involving the types of issues that we routinely confront may require monetary payments as well as corporate integrity agreements.\nAdditionally, qui tam or “whistleblower” actions initiated under the civil False Claims Act may be pending but placed under seal by the court to comply with the False\nClaims Act’s requirements for filing such suits. Also, from time to time, we may detect issues of non-compliance with federal healthcare laws pertaining to claims\nsubmission and reimbursement practices and/or financial relationships with physicians, among other things. We may avail ourselves of various mechanisms to address these\nissues, including participation in voluntary disclosure protocols. Participating in voluntary disclosure protocols can have the potential for significant settlement obligations\nor even enforcement action. The Company generally has cooperated, and intends to continue to cooperate, with appropriate regulatory authorities as and when\ninvestigations, audits and inquiries arise.\nWe are a party to other litigation in the ordinary course of business. While we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of legal matters, we accrue a liability for legal\ncontingencies when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. It’s reasonably possible\nthe ultimate liability could exceed amounts currently estimated and we review established accruals and adjust them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings,\nadvice of legal counsel and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and our views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments,\ninvestigations or legal proceedings change, changes in our accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. Because of the high\ndegree of judgment involved in establishing loss estimates, the ultimate outcome of such matters will differ from our estimates and such differences may be material to our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAt September 30, 2024, we were committed to make future purchases for inventory and other items in 2024 that occur in the ordinary course of business under\nvarious purchase arrangements with fixed purchase provisions aggregating approximately $44.0 million\nNOTE 13 REVENUE RECOGNITION\nWe generate revenues from services, products and intellectual property as follows:\nRevenue from services\nRevenue for laboratory services is recognized at the time test results are reported, which approximates when services are provided and the performance obligations\nare satisfied. Services are provided to patients covered by various third-party payor programs including various managed care organizations, as well as the Medicare and\nMedicaid programs. Billings for services are included in revenue net of allowances for contractual discounts, allowances for differences between the amounts billed and\nestimated program payment amounts, and implicit price concessions provided to uninsured patients which are all elements of variable consideration.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe following are descriptions of our payors for laboratory services:\nHealthcare Insurers. Reimbursements from healthcare insurers are based on negotiated fee-for-service schedules. Revenues consist of amounts billed, net of\ncontractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from such payors, which considers historical denial and\ncollection experience and the terms of our contractual arrangements. Adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts from the third-party payors, are recorded upon\nsettlement.\nGovernment Payors. Reimbursements from government payors are based on fee-for-service schedules set by governmental authorities, including traditional Medicare\nand Medicaid. Revenues consist of amounts billed, net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to\nreceive from such payors, which considers historical denial and collection experience and the terms of our contractual arrangements. Adjustments to the allowances, based\non actual receipts from the government payors, are recorded upon settlement.\nClient Payors. Client payors include physicians, hospitals, employers, and other institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis, and are billed and\nrecognized as revenue based on negotiated fee schedules.\nPatients. Uninsured patients are billed based on established patient fee schedules or fees negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. Insured patients\n(including amounts for coinsurance and deductible responsibilities) are billed based on fees negotiated with healthcare insurers. Collection of billings from patients is\nsubject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay. Revenues consist of amounts billed net of discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with our policies\nand implicit price concessions. Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration that we expect to receive from\npatients, which considers historical collection experience and other factors including current market conditions. Adjustments to the estimated allowances, based on actual\nreceipts from the patients, are recorded upon settlement.\nThe complexities and ambiguities of billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as considerations unique to Medicare and Medicaid programs,\nrequire us to estimate the potential for retroactive adjustments as an element of variable consideration in the recognition of revenue in the period the related services are\nrendered. Actual amounts are adjusted in the period those adjustments become known. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $2.2 million\nand $19.8 million of negative revenue adjustments primarily due to the composition of patient pay mix.\nThird-party payors, including government programs, may decide to deny payment or recoup payments for testing they contend were improperly billed or not\nmedically necessary, against their coverage determinations, or for which they believe they have otherwise overpaid (including as a result of their own error), and we may be\nrequired to refund payments already received. Our revenues may be subject to retroactive adjustment as a result of these factors among others, including without limitation,\ndiffering interpretations of billing and coding guidance and changes by government agencies and payors in interpretations, requirements, and “conditions of participation” in\nvarious programs. We have processed requests for recoupment from third-party payors in the ordinary course of our business, and it is likely that we will continue to do so\nin the future. If a third-party payor denies payment for testing or recoups money from us in a later period, reimbursement for our testing could decline.\nAs an integral part of our billing compliance program, we periodically assess our billing and coding practices, respond to payor audits on a routine basis, and\ninvestigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements, as well as overpayment claims which may arise\nfrom time to time without fault on the part of the Company. We may have an obligation to reimburse Medicare, Medicaid, and third-party payors for\noverpayments regardless of fault. We have periodically identified and reported overpayments, reimbursed payors for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action.\nSettlements with third-party payors for retroactive adjustments due to audits, reviews or investigations are also considered variable consideration and are included in\nthe determination of the estimated transaction price for providing services. These settlements are estimated based on the terms of the payment agreement with the payor,\ncorrespondence from the payor and our historical settlement activity, including an assessment of the probability a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will\noccur when the uncertainty is subsequently resolved. Estimated settlements are adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known (that is, new information becomes\navailable), or as years are settled or are no longer subject to such audits, reviews, and investigations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had liabilities of\napproximately $4.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively, within Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities related to reimbursements for payor overpayments.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe composition of revenue from services by payor for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nHealthcare insurers $ 76,184 $ 81,469 $ 229,600 $ 238,934\nGovernment payers 20,368 19,909 63,561 61,250\nClient payers 20,773 25,906 71,521 77,973\nPatients 3,946 4,395 12,875 12,943\nTotal $ 121,271 $ 131,679 $ 377,557 $ 391,100\nRevenue from products\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recorded reflects the consideration\nthat we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Our estimates for sales returns and allowances are based upon the historical patterns of product returns\nand allowances taken, matched against the sales from which they originated, and our evaluation of specific factors that may increase or decrease the risk of product returns.\nProduct revenues are recorded net of estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, co-pay assistance and other deductions (collectively, “Sales Deductions”) as well as\nestimated product returns which are all elements of variable consideration. Allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenues are recognized.\nThe actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates,\nwhich would affect revenue from products in the period such variances become known.\nRayaldee is distributed in the U.S. principally through the retail pharmacy channel, which initiates with the largest wholesalers in the U.S. (collectively, “Rayaldee\nCustomers”). In addition to distribution agreements with Rayaldee Customers, we have entered into arrangements with many healthcare providers and payors that provide\nfor government-mandated or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of Rayaldee.\nWe recognize revenue for shipments of Rayaldee at the time of delivery to customers after estimating Sales Deductions and product returns as elements of variable\nconsideration utilizing historical information and market research projections. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $5.8 million and\n$19.9 million, respectively, in net product revenue from sales of Rayaldee. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $7.3 million and $21.7\nmillion, respectively, in net product revenue from sales of Rayaldee.\nThe following table presents an analysis of Rayaldee product sales allowances and accruals for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nChargebacks,\ndiscounts,\n(In thousands) rebates and fees Governmental Returns Total\nBalance at June 30, 2024 $ 2,743 $ 5,991 $ 2,194 $ 10,928\nProvision related to current period sales 4,005 5,776 317 10,098\nCredits or payments made (5,058) (7,013) (278) (12,349)\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 1,690 $ 4,754 $ 2,233 $ 8,677\nTotal gross Rayaldee sales $ 15,865\nProvision for Rayaldee sales allowances and accruals as a percentage of gross Rayaldee\nsales 64%\n38\nTable of Contents\nChargebacks,\ndiscounts,\n(In thousands) rebates and fees Governmental Returns Total\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 2,578 $ 6,150 $ 2,192 $ 10,920\nProvision related to current period sales 12,224 16,325 989 29,538\nCredits or payments made (13,112) (17,721) (948) (31,781)\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 1,690 $ 4,754 $ 2,233 $ 8,677\nTotal gross Rayaldee sales $ 49,447\nProvision for Rayaldee sales allowances and accruals as a percentage of gross Rayaldee\nsales 60%\nChargebacks,\ndiscounts,\n(In thousands) rebates and fees Governmental Returns Total\nBalance at June 30, 2023 $ 2,330 $ 5,954 $ 1,634 $ 9,918\nProvision related to current period sales 3,446 4,998 322 8,766\nCredits or payments made (4,125) (4,207) (15) (8,347)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 1,651 $ 6,745 $ 1,941 $ 10,337\nTotal gross Rayaldee sales $ 16,090\nProvision for Rayaldee sales allowances and accruals as a percentage of gross Rayaldee\nsales 54%\nChargebacks,\ndiscounts,\n(In thousands) rebates and fees Governmental Returns Total\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 1,532 $ 5,063 $ 1,683 $ 8,278\nProvision related to current period sales 10,702 14,604 959 26,265\nCredits or payments made (10,583) (12,922) (701) (24,206)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 1,651 $ 6,745 $ 1,941 $ 10,337\nTotal gross Rayaldee sales $ 47,940\nProvision for Rayaldee sales allowances and accruals as a percentage of gross Rayaldee\nsales 55%\nTaxes collected from customers related to revenues from services and revenues from products are excluded from revenues.\nRevenue from intellectual property and other\nWe recognize revenues from the transfer of intellectual property generated through license, development, collaboration and/or commercialization agreements. The\nterms of these agreements typically include payment to us for one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; development and commercialization\nmilestone payments; funding of research and/or development activities; and royalties on sales of licensed products. Revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of a\nperformance obligation by transferring control of a good or service to the customer.\n39\nTable of Contents\nFor research, development and/or commercialization agreements that result in revenues, we identify all material performance obligations, which may include a\nlicense to intellectual property and know-how, and research and development activities. In order to determine the transaction price, in addition to any upfront payment, we\nestimate the amount of variable consideration at the outset of the contract either utilizing the expected value or most likely amount method, depending on the facts and\ncircumstances relative to the contract. We constrain (reduce) our estimates of variable consideration such that it is probable that a significant reversal of previously\nrecognized revenue will not occur throughout the life of the contract. When determining if variable consideration should be constrained, we consider whether there are\nfactors outside of our control that could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, we consider the likelihood and magnitude of a potential\nreversal of revenue. These estimates are re-assessed each reporting period as required.\nUpfront License Fees: If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be functional intellectual property distinct from the other performance obligations\nidentified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from nonrefundable, upfront license fees based on the relative value prescribed to the license compared to the total\nvalue of the arrangement. The revenue is recognized when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses\nthat are not distinct from other obligations identified in the arrangement, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine\nwhether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. If the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time, we apply an\nappropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from nonrefundable, upfront license fees. We evaluate the measure of progress each\nreporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development Activities: If we are entitled to reimbursement from our customers for specified research and development expenses, we account for them\nas separate performance obligations if distinct. We also determine whether the research and development funding would result in revenues or an offset to research and\ndevelopment expenses in accordance with provisions of gross or net revenue presentation. The corresponding revenues or offset to research and development expenses are\nrecognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.\nBARDA Contract: Revenue from the BARDA Contract is generated under terms that are cost plus fee. We recognize revenue using the incurred costs output method\nto measure progress. Revenue will only be recognized when research and development services are performed to the extent of actual costs incurred.\nSales-based Milestone and Royalty Payments: Our customers may be required to pay us sales-based milestone payments or royalties on future sales of commercial\nproducts. We recognize revenues related to sales-based milestone and royalty payments upon the later to occur of (i) achievement of the customer’s underlying sales or (ii)\nsatisfaction of any performance obligation(s) related to these sales, in each case assuming the license to our intellectual property is deemed to be the predominant item to\nwhich the sales-based milestones and/or royalties relate.\nOther Potential Products and Services: Arrangements may include an option for license rights, future supply of drug substance or drug product for either clinical\ndevelopment or commercial supply at the licensee’s election. We assess if these options provide a material right to the licensee and if so, they are accounted for as separate\nperformance obligations at the inception of the contract and revenue is recognized only if the option is exercised and products or services are subsequently delivered or\nwhen the rights expire. If the promise is based on market terms and not considered a material right, the option is accounted for if and when exercised. If we are entitled to\nadditional payments when the licensee exercises these options, any additional payments are generally recorded in license or other revenues when the licensee obtains control\nof the goods, which is upon delivery.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other was $13.2 million, an increase from $6.2 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to $5.5 million from the BARDA Contract (as defined and described in Note 14). Gross\nprofit share and royalty payments for NGENLA (Somatrogon) and Pfizer's Genotropin® (Somatropin) also increased to $7.0 million, compared with $4.9 million for the\nsame period in 2023.\n40\nTable of Contents\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other decreased to $34.3 million from $165.9 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to one-time milestone payments received in 2023, including a $90.0 million payment related to\nNGENLA, a $50.0 million payment from Merck for rights granted under the Merck Agreement, a $7.0 million payment from VFMCRP triggered by the German price\napproval for Rayaldee, and a $2.5 million payment from Nicoya upon submission of an investigational new drug application to China's Center for Drug Evaluation. See\nNote 14 for a description of the arrangements pursuant to which such milestone payments were received. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included\n$18.9 million in gross profit share and royalty payments for NGENLA (Somatrogon) and Pfizer's Genotropin® (Somatropin), compared to $11.8 million in the same period\nin 2023, as well as $12.8 million from the BARDA Contract during the 2024 period.\nNOTE 14 STRATEGIC ALLIANCES\nBiomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority\nOn September 28, 2023, ModeX was awarded a contract (as amended as decribed below, the “BARDA Contract”) by the Biomedical Advanced Research and\nDevelopment Authority (\"BARDA\"), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This\ncontract aims to advance a platform and product candidates addressing various public health threats, specifically in viral infectious diseases. The funding enables the\nresearch, development, and clinical evaluation of multispecific antibodies based on ModeX's proprietary MSTAR technology. MSTAR is a flexible, plug-and-play platform\ncapable of incorporating multiple independent antibody binding sites into a single molecule, expanding its therapeutic potential and enabling rapid responses to emerging\ninfections, including viral variants like COVID-19, influenza, and other pathogens.\nIn September 2024, ModeX entered into two amendments (the “BARDA Amendments”) to modify the scope and funding of the BARDA Contract. The BARDA\nAmendments structured the funding thereunder as cost-plus-fixed-fee, which includes a $26.9 million supplement to further advance the development of COVID-19\nmultispecific antibodies. This increased funding supports the ongoing development, manufacturing, and execution of a Phase 1 clinical trial for a next-generation MSTAR\nmultispecific antibody with broad neutralizing activity against known SARS-CoV-2 variants. The BARDA Amendments also provided for BARDA's exercise of the option\nfor the development of a multispecific protein antibody for influenza or another pathogen, with $24.1 million allocated to cover the expanded work under this exercised\noption. These modifications increased the total value of the BARDA Contract from $59.0 million to $110.0 million, with the potential value if BARDA exercises all options\nthereunder to expand ModeX's services, increasing from $168.6 million to $205 million.\nAs part of the research program, gene-based delivery methods for the multispecific antibodies will be developed using mRNA or DNA vectors to leverage the body's\nnatural protein production processes. BARDA will make periodic progress assessments, and the continuation of the BARDA Contract depends on ModeX’s performance,\nthe timeliness and quality of deliverables, and other factors. The BARDA Contract contains customary government contract provisions, including BARDA's right to\nterminate the contract in its discretion.\nThe Company evaluated the BARDA Contract under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), and determined that the U.S.\ngovernment meets the definition of a customer. The scope of the BARDA Contract includes preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing activities, as well as regulatory, quality\nassurance, management, and administrative activities. The research and development effort will progress in stages covering base and option segments, with ModeX\ncompleting specific tasks in each segment.\nThe Company identified three potential material promises under the BARDA Contract: (i) development of a tetravalent trispecific antibody for COVID-19; (ii)\ndevelopment of a multispecific protein antibody for influenza or another pathogen; and (iii) nucleic acid delivery of a multispecific antibody for influenza or another\npathogen. The Company determined the promise to develop a tetravalent trispecific antibody for COVID-19 is a separate performance obligation, as it is distinct within the\ncontract and provides standalone value. Similarly, the exercised option to develop a multispecific protein antibody for influenza or another pathogen is also a separate\nperformance obligation. However, the Company determined that the nucleic acid delivery option does not offer incremental discounts beyond those typically provided for\nsuch goods and services, and therefore does not represent a material right. As such, the options in (iii) were not considered performance obligations at the outset of the\nBARDA Contract.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe Company concluded that research and development services performed under the BARDA Contract would be recognized as revenue when research and\ndevelopment services are performed to the extent of actual costs incurred including a fixed fee and will be reimbursed by BARDA. Costs incurred represent work\nperformed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control of the research and development to BARDA. Types of contract costs include labor,\nmaterial, and third-party services. As such, the related BARDA revenue is recognized as revenue from transfer of intellectual property and other within the Company’s\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded $5.5 million and $12.8 million in revenue under the BARDA\nContract. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, excluding unexercised contract options, was\n$96.0 million. We expect to recognize this amount as revenue through February 2028.\nMerck\nOn March 8, 2023, ModeX, the Company (with respect to certain sections), and Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC (“Merck”) entered into a License and Research\nCollaboration Agreement (the “Merck Agreement”) pursuant to which ModeX granted to Merck a license to certain patent rights and know-how in connection with the\ndevelopment of ModeX’s preclinical nanoparticle vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr Virus.\nUnder the terms of the Merck Agreement, ModeX granted to Merck an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license to certain intellectual property to develop,\nmanufacture, use and commercialize (i) a multivalent or monovalent vaccine assembled using our platform for Epstein-Barr Virus (“Vaccine”), and (ii) any pharmaceutical\nor biological preparation in final form containing a Vaccine for sale or for administration to human patients in a clinical trial for all uses (“Product”). We received an initial\npayment of $50.0 million and are eligible to receive up to an additional $872.5 million upon the achievement of certain commercial and development milestones under\nseveral indications. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments ranging from high single digits to low double digits upon achievement of certain sales targets of\nthe Product. Certain of the rights subject to the license provided by us under the Merck Agreement were obtained by us from Sanofi pursuant to that certain License\nAgreement entered into as of July 1, 2021 (“Sanofi In-License Agreement”) between us and Sanofi, a French corporation (“Sanofi”), and a portion of the upfront payment,\nmilestones and royalties received by us under the Merck Agreement may be payable to Sanofi under the terms of the Sanofi In-License Agreement. As a result of such\nobligations under the Sanofi In-License Agreement, we paid $12.5 million to Sanofi during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nAs part of their strategic collaboration, ModeX and Merck have put in place a research plan to manage research and other development activities related to the\ndevelopment of a Vaccine or Product including a joint steering committee to facilitate the research program. As part of the research plan, they will use a third-party contract\ndevelopment and manufacturing organization to carry out such activities unless otherwise agreed. Development costs incurred by ModeX in furtherance of these\ndevelopment activities will be reimbursed by Merck. To date, we have spent $24.5 million of development costs related to the Epstein -Barr Virus, for which Merck has\nprovided reimbursement.\nThe Merck Agreement will remain in effect until one or more Products receive marketing authorization, and, thereafter, until the expiration of all royalty obligations\nunless earlier terminated as permitted under the Merck Agreement. In addition to termination rights for material breach and bankruptcy, Merck is permitted to terminate the\nMerck Agreement in its entirety without cause after a specified notice period. If Merck terminates the Merck Agreement for convenience or by us for Merck’s uncured\nmaterial breach, we may elect to receive a reversion license such that we can continue its work with Vaccines and Products which have not been terminated due to a material\nsafety issue.\nLeaderMed\nOn September 14, 2021, we and LeaderMed announced the formation of a joint venture to develop, manufacture and commercialize two of OPKO’s clinical stage,\nlong-acting drug products in Greater China and eight other Asian territories.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, we have granted the joint venture exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize (a) OPK88003, an oxyntomodulin\nanalog being developed for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, and (b) Factor VIIa-CTP, a novel long-acting coagulation factor being developed to treat hemophilia, in\nexchange for a 47% ownership interest in the joint venture. In addition, during 2021 we received an upfront payment of $1 million and will be reimbursed for clinical trial\nmaterial and technical support we provide the joint venture.\n42\nTable of Contents\nLeaderMed is responsible for funding the joint venture’s operations, development and commercialization efforts and, together with its syndicate partners, initially\ninvested $11 million in exchange for a 53% ownership interest. We retain full rights to oxyntomodulin and Factor VIIa-CTP in all other geographies.\nCAMP4 Therapeutics\nOn July 6, 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “CAMP4 Agreement”) with CAMP4, pursuant to which we granted to CAMP4 an exclusive\nlicense to develop, manufacture, commercialize or improve therapeutics utilizing the AntagoNAT technology, an oligonucleotide platform developed under OPKO CURNA,\nwhich includes the molecule for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, together with any derivative or modification thereof (the “Licensed Compound”) and any\npharmaceutical product that comprises or contains the Licensed Compound, alone or in combination with one or more other active ingredients (“Licensed Product”),\nworldwide. The CAMP4 Agreement grant covers human pharmaceutical, prophylactic, and therapeutic and certain diagnostic uses.\nWe received an initial upfront payment of $1.5 million and 3,373,008 shares of CAMP4’s Series A Prime Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”), which then equated to\napproximately 9% of the outstanding shares of CAMP4, and we are eligible to receive up to $3.5 million in development milestone payments for Dravet syndrome products,\nand $4 million for non-Dravet syndrome products, as well as sales milestones of up to $90 million for Dravet syndrome products and up to $90 million for non-Dravet\nsyndrome products. We may also receive double digit royalty payments on the net sales of royalty bearing products, subject to adjustment. In addition, upon achievement of\ncertain development milestones, we will be eligible to receive equity consideration of up to 5,782,299 shares of Preferred Stock in connection with Dravet syndrome\nproducts and up to 1,082,248 shares of Preferred Stock in connection with non-Dravet syndrome products. In connection with our acquisition of CURNA, we agreed to pay\nfuture consideration to the sellers upon the achievement of certain events. As a result of our execution of the CAMP4 Agreement, we will have to pay a percentage of any\npayments received under the CAMP4 Agreement to the former CURNA stockholders.\nThe Company was notified that the FDA placed the Dravet clinical trials on hold and CAMP4 subsequently ceased development efforts.\nNICOYA Macau Limited\nOn June 18, 2021, EirGen, our wholly owned subsidiary, and NICOYA Macau Limited (“Nicoya”), a Macau corporation and an affiliate of NICOYA Therapeutics,\nentered into a Development and License Agreement (the “Nicoya Agreement”) granting Nicoya the exclusive rights for the development and commercialization of extended\nrelease calcifediol (the “Nicoya Product”) in Greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (collectively, the “Nicoya Territory”).\nExtended release calcifediol is marketed in the U.S. by OPKO under the tradename Rayaldee. The license grant to Nicoya covers the therapeutic and preventative use of the\nNicoya Product for SHPT in non-dialysis and hemodialysis chronic kidney disease patients (the “Nicoya Field”).\nEirGen received an initial upfront payment of $5 million and was eligible to receive an additional $5 million tied to the first anniversary of the effective date of the\nNicoya Agreement, as amended, of which EirGen has received $2.5 million plus accrued interest for the delayed payment. Furthermore, EirGen received the additional\n$2.5 million upon Nicoya’s submission of an investigational new drug (IND) application to the Center for Drug Evaluation of China in March 2023. EirGen is also eligible\nto receive up to an additional aggregate amount of $115 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones by Nicoya for the\nNicoya Product in the Nicoya Territory. EirGen is eligible to receive tiered, double digit royalty payments at rates in the low double digits on net product sales within the\nNicoya Territory and in the Nicoya Field.\nNicoya is, at its sole cost and expense, responsible for performing all development activities necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for the Nicoya Product in the\nNicoya Territory and will be responsible for all commercial activities pertaining to the Nicoya Product in the Nicoya Territory.\n43\nTable of Contents\nUnless earlier terminated, the Nicoya Agreement will remain in effect until such time as all royalty payment terms and extended payment terms have expired, and\nNicoya shall have no further payment obligations to EirGen under the terms of the Nicoya Agreement. Nicoya’s royalty obligations expire on the later of (i) expiration of\nthe last to expire valid patent claim covering the Nicoya Product sold in the Nicoya Territory, (ii) expiration of all regulatory and data exclusivity applicable to the Nicoya\nProduct in the Nicoya Territory, and (iii) on a product-by-product basis, ten (10) years after such Nicoya Product’s first commercial sale in the Nicoya Territory. In addition\nto termination rights for material breach and bankruptcy, Nicoya is permitted to terminate the Nicoya Agreement after a specified notice period.\nVFMCRP\nIn May 2016, EirGen and Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. (“VFMCRP ”) entered into a Development and License Agreement (the “VFMCRP\nAgreement”) for the development and commercialization of Rayaldee (the “Product”) worldwide, except for (i) the United States and Canada, (ii) any country in Central\nAmerica or South America (including Mexico), (iii) Russia, (iv) China, (v) South Korea, (vi) Ukraine, (vii) Belorussia, (viii) Azerbaijan, (ix) Kazakhstan, (x) Taiwan (xi)\nthe Middle East, and (xii) all countries of Africa (the “VFMCRP Territory”), as amended. The license to VFMCRP potentially covers all therapeutic and prophylactic uses\nof the Product in human patients (the “VFMCRP Field”), provided that initially the license is for the use of the Product for the treatment or prevention of SHPT related to\npatients with CKD and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency (the “VFMCRP Initial Indication”).\nIn January 2023, the German Association of Statutory Health Insurance funds (GKV-SV) granted price approval for Rayaldee. This triggered a milestone payment of\n$7.0 million. In 2022, we recognized a separate milestone payment of $3.0 million in revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other for the first sale of\nRayaldee in Europe.\nEffective May 23, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the VFMCRP Agreement pursuant to which the parties thereto agreed to include Japan as part of\nthe VFMCRP Territory.\nEffective May 5, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the VFMCRP Agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to exclude Mexico, South Korea, the Middle\nEast and all of the countries of Africa from the VFMCRP Territory. In addition, the parties agreed to certain amendments to the milestone structure and to reduce minimum\nroyalties payable. As revised, the Company has received a $3 million payment triggered by the first marketing approval of Rayaldee in Europe, $7.0 million payment\ntriggered by the Germany price approval by the local sick fund association, and is eligible to receive up to an additional $15 million in regulatory milestones and $200\nmillion in milestone payments tied to launch, pricing and sales of Rayaldee, and tiered, double-digit royalties.\nWe plan to share responsibility with VFMCRP for the conduct of trials specified within an agreed-upon development plan, with each company leading certain\nactivities within the plan. EirGen will lead the manufacturing activities within and outside the VFMCRP Territory and the commercialization activities outside the VFMCRP\nTerritory and outside the VFMCRP Field in the VFMCRP Territory and VFMCRP will lead the commercialization activities in the VFMCRP Territory and the VFMCRP\nField. For the initial development plan, the companies have agreed to certain cost sharing arrangements. VFMCRP will be responsible for all other development costs\nthat VFMCRP considers necessary to develop the Product for the use of the Product for the VFMCRP Initial Indication in the VFMCRP Territory in the VFMCRP Field\nexcept as otherwise provided in the VFMCRP Agreement. The first of the clinical studies provided for in the development activities commenced in September 2018.\nIn connection with the VFMCRP Agreement, the parties entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which EirGen granted to VFMCRP an exclusive option (the\n“Option”) to acquire an exclusive license under certain EirGen patents and technology to use, import, offer for sale, sell, distribute and commercialize the Product in the\nU.S. solely for the treatment of SHPT in dialysis patients with CKD and vitamin D insufficiency (the “Dialysis Indication”). Upon exercise of the Option, VFMCRP has\nagreed to reimburse EirGen for all of the development costs incurred by EirGen with respect to the Product for the Dialysis Indication in the U.S. VFMCRP would also pay\nEirGen up to an additional aggregate amount of $555 million of sales-based milestones upon the achievement of certain milestones and would be obligated to pay royalties\nat percentage rates that range from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties on sales of the Product in the U.S. for the Dialysis Indication. To date, VFMCRP has not exercised the\nOption.\n44\nTable of Contents\nPayments received for regulatory milestones and sales milestones are non-refundable. The regulatory milestones are payable if and when VFMCRP obtains approval\nfrom certain regulatory authorities and will be recognized as revenue in the period in which the associated milestone is achieved, assuming all other revenue recognition\ncriteria are met. We account for the sales milestones as royalties and sales milestones payments will be recognized as revenue in the period in which the associated\nmilestone is achieved or sales occur, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nPfizer Inc.\nIn December 2014, we entered into an exclusive worldwide agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of our long-acting Somatrogon (hGH-\nCTP) for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency (“GHD”) in adults and children, as well as for the treatment of growth failure in children born small for gestational\nage (the “Pfizer Transaction”). In May 2020, we entered into an amended and restated development and commercialization license with Pfizer, effective January 1, 2020\n(the “Restated Pfizer Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties agreed, among other things, to share all costs for Manufacturing Activities, as defined in the Restated\nPfizer Agreement, for developing a licensed product for the three indications included in the Restated Pfizer Agreement.\nIn June 2023, the FDA approved NGENLA (Somatrogon (hGH-CTP)) a once-weekly injection to treat pediatric growth hormone deficiency in the United States. In\nearly 2022, the European Commission and Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan approved NGENLA (Somatrogon). We have also received pricing approvals in\nGermany and Japan. NGENLA (Somatrogon (hGH-CTP)) is approved for the treatment of pediatric GHD in more than 50 markets, including Canada, Australia, Japan, and\nEU Member States. With the achievement of these milestones, in 2023 we recorded revenue of $90 million, and in 2022 we recorded $85.0 million, in each case under the\nRestated Pfizer Agreement.\nOn October 21, 2019, we and Pfizer announced that the global phase 3 trial evaluating Somatrogon dosed once-weekly in prepubertal children with GHD met its\nprimary endpoint of non-inferiority to daily Genotropin® (somatropin) for injection, as measured by annual height velocity at 12 months.\nUnder the terms of the Restated Pfizer Agreement we received non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payments of $295.0 million and are eligible to receive up to\nan additional $275.0 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. Pfizer received the exclusive license to commercialize Somatrogon worldwide. In\naddition, we are eligible to receive regional, tiered gross profit sharing for both Somatrogon and Pfizer’s Genotropin® (somatropin) in all global markets, with the U.S.\nregion commencing gross profit sharing in August 2023.\nThe Restated Pfizer Agreement will remain in effect until the last sale of the licensed product, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. In addition to\ntermination rights for material breach and bankruptcy, Pfizer is permitted to terminate the Restated Pfizer Agreement in its entirety, or with respect to one or more world\nregions, without cause after a specified notice period. If the Restated Pfizer Agreement is terminated by us for Pfizer’s uncured material breach, or by Pfizer without cause,\nprovision has been made for transition of product and product responsibilities to us for the terminated regions, as well as continued supply of product by Pfizer or transfer of\nsupply to us in order to support the terminated regions.\nWe recognized the non-refundable $295.0 million upfront payments as revenue as the research and development services were completed. As of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, we had no contract liabilities related to the Pfizer Transaction.\nThe Restated Pfizer Agreement includes milestone payments of $275.0 million upon the achievement of certain milestones. The milestones range from $20.0 million\nto $90.0 million each and are based on achievement of regulatory approval in the U.S. and regulatory approval and price approval in other major markets. The milestone\npayments will be recognized as revenue in the period in which the associated milestone is achieved, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. To date, $175.0\nmillion of revenue has been recognized related to the achievement of the milestones.\nOther\nWe have completed strategic deals with numerous institutions and commercial partners. In connection with these agreements, upon the achievement of certain\nmilestones we are obligated to make certain payments and have royalty obligations upon sales of products developed under the license agreements. At this time, we are\nunable to estimate the timing and amounts of payments as the obligations are based on future development of the licensed products.\n45\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 15 SEGMENTS\nWe manage our operations in two reportable segments, pharmaceutical and diagnostics. The pharmaceutical segment consists of our pharmaceutical operations in\nChile, Mexico, Ireland, Israel and Spain, Rayaldee product sales and our pharmaceutical research and development. The diagnostics segment primarily consists of our\nclinical laboratory operations through BioReference. There are no significant inter-segment sales. We evaluate the performance of each segment based on operating profit or\nloss. There is no inter-segment allocation of interest expense and income taxes.\nInformation regarding our operations and assets for our operating segments and the unallocated corporate operations as well as geographic information are as\nfollows:\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended September\nSeptember 30, 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue from services:\nPharmaceutical $ — $ — $ — $ —\nDiagnostics 121,271 131,679 377,557 391,100\nCorporate — — — —\n$ 121,271 $ 131,679 $ 377,557 $ 391,100\nRevenue from products:\nPharmaceutical $ 39,143 $ 40,670 $ 117,675 $ 124,553\nDiagnostics — — — —\nCorporate — — — —\n$ 39,143 $ 40,670 $ 117,675 $ 124,553\nRevenue from transfer of intellectual property and other:\nPharmaceutical $ 13,218 $ 6,246 $ 34,272 $ 165,938\nDiagnostics — — — —\nCorporate — — — —\n$ 13,218 $ 6,246 $ 34,272 $ 165,938\nOperating income (loss):\nPharmaceutical $ (32,196) $ (25,375) $ (84,697) $ 57,210\nDiagnostics 58,541 (29,081) (2,443) (113,344)\nCorporate (12,129) (9,951) (31,786) (31,841)\n$ 14,216 $ (64,407) $ (118,926) $ (87,975)\nDepreciation and amortization:\nPharmaceutical $ 18,043 $ 17,807 $ 53,899 $ 53,649\nDiagnostics 6,120 8,376 20,238 25,666\nCorporate — — — —\n$ 24,163 $ 26,183 $ 74,137 $ 79,315\nLoss from investment in investees:\nPharmaceutical $ (3) $ (20) $ (7) $ (99)\nDiagnostics — — — —\nCorporate — — — —\n$ (3) $ (20) $ (7) $ (99)\nRevenues:\nUnited States $ 132,663 $ 139,043 $ 410,422 $ 462,987\nIreland 11,514 8,654 30,579 121,249\nChile 16,576 16,932 49,067 52,427\nSpain 6,297 4,349 17,828 16,427\nIsrael 196 3,155 797 9,388\nMexico 5,630 5,897 18,621 17,447\nOther 756 565 2,190 1,666\n$ 173,632 $ 178,595 $ 529,504 $ 681,591\n46\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nAssets:\nPharmaceutical $ 1,271,781 $ 1,331,764\nDiagnostics 517,871 630,753\nCorporate 466,451 49,181\n$ 2,256,103 $ 2,011,698\nGoodwill:\nPharmaceutical $ 316,161 $ 315,235\nDiagnostics 219,707 283,025\n$ 535,868 $ 598,260\nNo customer represented more than 10% of our total consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Our leases generally do not provide an implicit interest rate, and we therefore use our\nincremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring operating lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate we\nwould incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of the lease within a particular currency\nenvironment. We used the incremental borrowing rates as of January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. Many of our leases contain rental\nescalation, renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into our determination of lease payments as appropriate. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot\nbe determined at the commencement of the lease are not included in the right-to-use assets or liabilities.\nWe elected the use of permitted practical expedients of not recording leases on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet when the leases have terms of 12 months\nor less, and we elected not to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead account for each separate lease component and the nonlease components\nassociated with that lease component as a single lease component.\nOn January 2, 2023, ModeX entered into a 10-year office lease agreement that commenced in October 2023. ModeX was previously located in Natick, Massachusetts\nand relocated to Weston, Massachusetts, upon lease commencement. The new location is approximately 33,056 square feet of office space. ModeX has two options to\nextend the lease term for an additional five years per extension, which would commence upon the expiration of the term in October 2033. Straight-line monthly expense for\nthe lease is $243.5 thousand.\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the lease balances within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n(in thousands) Classification on the Balance Sheet September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease assets Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 62,812 $ 68,088\nFinance lease assets Property, plant and equipment, net 6,544 10,101\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nOperating lease liabilities Current maturities of operating leases 12,741 12,996\nAccrued expenses Current maturities of finance leases 1,855 2,827\nLong-term\nOperating lease liabilities Operating lease liabilities 52,057 54,140\nOther long-term liabilities Finance lease liabilities $ 4,689 $ 7,274\nWeighted average remaining lease term\nOperating leases (in years) 6.3 7.1\nFinance leases (in years) 7.1 6.2\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases 5.3% 5.4%\nFinance leases 3.7% 3.8%\nThe following table reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under noncancelable operating leases with\nterms of more than one year to the total operating lease liabilities recognized on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024:\n(in thousands) Operating Finance\nOctober 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 $ 3,043 $ 673\n2025 11,772 1,813\n2026 10,937 1,334\n2027 10,775 806\n2028 10,785 203\nThereafter 26,534 1,959\nTotal undiscounted future minimum lease payments 73,846 6,788\nLess: Difference between lease payments and discounted lease liabilities 9,048 244\nTotal lease liabilities $ 64,798 $ 6,544\nExpense under operating leases and finance leases was $15.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included\n$1.5 million of variable lease costs.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOVERVIEW\nYou should read this discussion together with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, related notes, and other financial information included\nelsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q together with our audited consolidated financial statements, related notes, and other information contained in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”). The following discussion contains assumptions, estimates and other forward-looking\nstatements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under “Risk Factors,” in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K and as described from time\nto time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these\nforward-looking statements.\nWe are a diversified healthcare company that seeks to establish industry leading positions in large and rapidly growing medical markets. Our pharmaceutical business\nfeatures Rayaldee, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism (“SHPT”) in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic\nkidney disease (“CKD”) and vitamin D insufficiency, and Somatrogon (hGH-CTP), a once-weekly human growth hormone injection. We have partnered with Pfizer Inc.\n(“Pfizer”) for the development and commercialization of Somatrogon (hGH-CTP). Regulatory approvals for Somatrogon (hGH-CTP) for the treatment of growth hormone\ndeficiency in children and adolescents have been secured in all major markets, including the United States, European Union (“EU\") Member States, Japan, Canada, and\nAustralia, where it is marketed under the brand name NGENLA®. Our 2022 acquisition of ModeX Therapeutics, Inc. (“ModeX”) has expanded our pharmaceutical pipeline\nwith early-stage immune therapies targeting cancer and infectious diseases.\nOur diagnostics business, BioReference Health, LLC (“BioReference”), is a highly specialized laboratory in the United States, with a sales and marketing team\nfocused on growth and new product integration, including the 4Kscore® prostate cancer test. BioReference® offers a broad spectrum of diagnostic testing services for\noncology, urology (4Kscore), and corrections nationwide, setting new standards with our industry-leading turnaround times. BioReference also provides comprehensive\nclinical and women’s health testing in New York and New Jersey. Our test offerings are backed by a team of board-certified medical professionals and driven by the latest\nhealthcare guidelines and standards- marketed directly to physicians, geneticists, hospitals, clinics, correctional facilities, and other healthcare providers. On September 16,\n2024 we completed an agreement to sell select assets of BioReference to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (\"Labcorp\"), as described below.\nThe Company maintains established, revenue-generating pharmaceutical platforms in Spain, Ireland, Chile, and Mexico, contributing to positive cash flow and\nfacilitating market entry for our development pipeline. In addition to these platforms, we operate a global pharmaceutical development and commercial supply company, a\nglobal supply chain operation, and manufacture specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in Israel through our subsidiary, FineTech.\n49\nTable of Contents\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nModeX Expands BARDA Collaboration\nIn September 2024, ModeX entered into two amendments (the \"BARDA Amendments\") to modify the scope and funding with our existing contract with the\nBiomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services. The BARDA Amendment increased the total contract value to $110.0 million, with a potential value of $205 million if BARDA exercises all\noptions thereunder to expand ModeX's services. The BARDA Amendment includes a $26.9 million supplement to accelerate the development of our COVID-19 program,\nincluding a Phase 1 clinical trial for a next-generation multispecific antibody with broad neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Additionally, BARDA exercised\na $24.1 million option to initiate the development of a multispecific antibody for influenza or another pathogen.\nCompletion of Disposition of Select BioReference Assets\nOn September 16, 2024, the Company completed the sale of certain assets of BioReference (the “BioReference Transaction”) to Labcorp. Labcorp paid to the\nCompany aggregate consideration of $237.5 million in cash, which is subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Labcorp Asset Purchase Agreement (as defined in\nNote 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (our \"Quarterly Financial Statements\")). The assets acquired by\nLabcorp include BioReference's laboratory testing businesses focused on clinical diagnostics, reproductive health, and women's health across the United States, excluding\nNew York and New Jersey operations. We retained our oncology and urology diagnostic services nationwide. The BioReference assets were formerly part of our diagnostics\nsegment. We recognized a gain of $121.5 million from the BioReference Transaction for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn July 18, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our Common Stock. Under this program, we may repurchase shares\nthrough various methods, including open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions and accelerated share repurchases, as well as pursuant to pre-set\ntrading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act, and otherwise in compliance with applicable laws. The timing and volume of repurchases\nwill depend on market conditions, our capital management, investment opportunities, and other factors. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number\nof shares, has no set expiration date, and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at our discretion. The Company repurchased 14,893,026 shares for approximately\n$23.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n$250 Million Note Purchase Agreement Secured by NGENLA’s Profit Share Payments\nOn July 17, 2024, the Company completed a private offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the “2044 Notes”), pursuant to a\nnote purchase agreement dated July 17, 2024 (the “2044 Note Purchase Agreement), by and among the Company, certain purchasers party thereto, the Company’s wholly-\nowned subsidiaries OPKO Biologics Limited (“OPKO Biologics”) and EirGen Pharma Ltd. (“EirGen”) as guarantors (OPKO Biologics and EirGen collectively, the “2044\nNote Guarantors”), and HCR Injection SPV, LLC, as agent (“Agent”). The 2044 Notes mature on July 17, 2044 and bear interest at the 3-month Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”) subject to a 4.0% per annum floor, plus 7.5% per annum. Interest is payable on the 2044 Notes on a quarterly basis determined by profit share\npayments received by EirGen pursuant to the profit share arrangement with Pfizer, Inc. (the “Royalty Payments”) set forth in the Restated Pfizer Agreement (as described in\nNote 4 to our Quarterly Financials). In the event that the aggregate amount of the Royalty Payments received by EirGen during the quarter preceding any quarterly interest\npayment date are less than the accrued and unpaid interest payable on such date, the excess interest payable on such date shall be paid-in-kind and added to the outstanding\nprincipal amount of the 2044 Notes. The Company will be required to pay the noteholders a 3% exit fee in connection with any repayment in full of the 2044 Notes,\nwhether at maturity or otherwise. In addition, in the event that the Company repays the 2044 Notes in full prior to the maturity date, the Company will be required to pay\nthe noteholders a make whole payment in an amount necessary such that the noteholders shall have received aggregate payments of principal, interest and fees in respect of\nthe 2044 Notes equal to at least 150% of the initial principal amount of the 2044 Notes, in the event that such prepayment shall occur on or prior to July 17, 2029, or 200%\nof the initial principal amount of the 2044 Notes, in the event that such prepayment shall occur following July 17, 2029. The Company may authorize up to an additional\n$50,000,000 in additional 2044 Notes to the purchasers on the same terms and conditions of the initial 2044 Notes.\n50\nTable of Contents\nOffering of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029\nIn January 2024, we completed a private offering of $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes\ndue 2029 (the “2029 Convertible 144A Notes”) in accordance with the terms of a note purchase agreement (the “144A Note Purchase Agreement”) entered into by and\nbetween the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (the “Initial Purchaser”). The $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Convertible 144A Notes\nincluded $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Convertible 144A Notes purchased on the Closing Date by the Initial Purchaser in accordance with its\noverallotment option.\nNet proceeds from the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes issuance totaled approximately $222.0 million after deducting fees and estimated offering expenses payable by\nus. We allocated approximately $50.0 million of these net proceeds to repurchase shares of our Common Stock. These repurchases were from purchasers of the 2029\nConvertible 144A Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected with or through the Initial Purchaser or its affiliate. The purchase price per share of the Common Stock\nin these transactions equaled the closing sale price of $0.9067 per share of Common Stock on January 4, 2024.\nContemporaneously with the closing of the offering of the 2029 Convertible Notes on January 9, 2024, we issued and sold approximately $71.1 million aggregate\nprincipal amount of our 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Convertible Affiliate Notes” and, together with the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes, the “2029\nConvertible Notes”) pursuant to the terms of a note purchase agreement entered into on January 4, 2024 (the “Affiliate Note Purchase Agreement”) by and among the\nCompany and certain investors including, Frost Gamma Investments Trust, a trust controlled by Phillip Frost, M.D., our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jane H.\nHsiao, Ph.D., MBA, our Vice-Chairman and Chief Technical Officer (collectively, the “Affiliate Purchasers”). Pursuant to the Affiliate Note Purchase Agreement, we issued\nand sold the 2029 Convertible Affiliate Notes to the Affiliate Purchasers in exchange for the entirety of the $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding\n2023 Convertible Notes held by the affiliate Purchasers, together with approximately $16.1 million of accrued but unpaid interest thereon.\nFurthermore, in connection with the closing of our offering of the 2029 Convertible Notes, we repurchased approximately $144.4 million aggregate principal amount\nof the 2025 Notes for cash, using $146.3 million of the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes.\nTermination of Share Lending Agreement\nOn January 22, 2024, we terminated our share lending agreement, dated February 4, 2019, with Jefferies Capital Services, LLC (“Share Borrower”). Through this\nagreement, we had lent the Share Borrower approximately 30 million shares of our common stock related to our 2019 issuance of the $200.0 million in 2025 Notes. We had\nsince reduced the number of outstanding borrowed shares by approximately 8.313 million. With the termination of this agreement, all remaining shares have been returned\nto us and are now held as treasury shares.\n51\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nApproximately 22.3% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (USD). This\ncompares to 30.7% for the same period in 2023. Our financial statements are reported in USD; therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates affect the translation of foreign-\ndenominated revenue and expenses. During the second quarter of 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our most significant currency exchange rate exposures were\nto the Euro and the Chilean Peso. Gross accumulated currency translation adjustments, recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, totaled $36.2 million and\n$34.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nWe are subject to foreign currency transaction risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a transaction is initiated and settled. To mitigate this risk,\nwe use foreign currency forward contracts. These contracts fix an exchange rate, allowing us to offset potential losses (or gains) caused by exchange rate changes at the\nsettlement date. As of September 30, 2024, we held no open foreign exchange forward contracts related to inventory purchases on letters of credit. As of December 31,\n2023, we held 52 open foreign exchange forward contracts related to inventory purchases on letters of credit.

Revenue from services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately $10.4 million, a decrease of 7.9% compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.0 million reduction in clinical test reimbursement rates and an $8.4 million decrease in clinical test volume, of\nwhich $3.3 million was attributable to the BioReference Transaction.\nEstimated collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as considerations\nunique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for retroactive adjustments when estimating variable consideration in the recognition of\nrevenue in the period the related services are rendered. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $0.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\nThese adjustments reflect changes in estimated implicit price concessions for services provided in prior periods, primarily due to shifts in the composition of our client mix\nThe composition of revenue from services by payor for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\nThree months ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nHealthcare insurers $ 76,184 $ 81,469\nGovernment payers 20,368 19,909\nClient payers 20,773 25,906\nPatients 3,946 4,395\nTotal $ 121,271 $ 131,679\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $2.5 million, an increase of 2.3% compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to $4.2 million in accruals set aside to cover volume shortfalls on contracts as a result of the Labcorp transaction.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $71.0\nmillion and $48.8 million, respectively, representing an increase of 45.4% from the prior period. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily\ndue to severance expense of $26.3 million, offset by a decrease in employee-related expenses, reflecting continued cost-reduction initiatives.\n53\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses. The following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses:\nResearch and Development Expenses Three months ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nResearch and development employee-related expenses $ 161 $ 446\nOther internal research and development expenses 332 91\nTotal research and development expenses $ 493 $ 537\nThe decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in\nemployee-related expenses as a result of the continued cost-reduction initiatives implemented at BioReference.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $3.9 million and $5.1 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to the BioReference Transaction, which impacted the amount of amortizable intangible assets.\nGain on sale of assets. Gain on sale of assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $121.5 million which reflects the gain on sale from the\nBioReference Transaction.\nPharmaceuticals\nFor the three months ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 Change % Change\nRevenues:\nRevenue from products $ 39,143 $ 40,670 $ (1,527) (4)%\nRevenue from transfer of intellectual property and other 13,218 6,246 6,972 112%\nTotal revenues 52,361 46,916 5,445 12%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue 24,657 24,543 114 0%\nSelling, general and administrative 15,161 13,503 1,658 12%\nResearch and development 28,244 18,885 9,359 50%\nContingent consideration — (1,125) 1,125 100%\nAmortization of intangible assets 16,495 16,485 10 0%\nTotal costs and expenses 84,557 72,291 12,266 17%\nLoss from operations $ (32,196) $ (25,375) $ (6,821) (27)%\nRevenue from products. Revenue from products for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $1.5 million or 3.8%, compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This decrease was largely attributable to lower Rayaldee sales, which generated $5.8 million of revenue for the three months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to $7.3 million for the same period in 2023. In addition, demand for our products in international operations increased, foreign currency fluctuations also\nnegatively impacted revenue.\nRevenue from transfer of intellectual property and other. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other\nwas $13.2 million compared to $6.3 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily attributable to $5.5 million from the BARDA Contract (as defined and\ndescribed in Note 14 to our Quarterly Financials). Gross profit share and royalty payments for NGENLA (Somatrogon) and Pfizer's Genotropin® (Somatropin) also\nincreased to $7.0 million, compared with $4.9 million for the same period in 2023.\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $0.1 million, an increase of 0.5%, compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Cost of revenue increased primarily due to a shift in product mix offset by favorable foreign currency exchange, which had a positive impact on cost of\nrevenue, reducing it by $1.5 million.\n54\nTable of Contents\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $15.2\nmillion and $13.5 million, respectively, an increase of 12.3% from the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by higher professional fees. Additionally,\nemployee-related expenses also contributed to the increase in SG&A in our international operations.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $28.2 million and $18.9\nmillion, respectively, an increase of 49.6% from the prior year period. Research and development expenses include external and internal expenses, partially offset by third-\nparty grants and funding arising from collaboration agreements. External expenses include clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations,\nlab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. We track external research and development expenses by individual\nprogram for phase 3 clinical trials for drug approval and premarket approval for diagnostics tests, if any. Internal expenses include employee-related expenses such as\nsalaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses are incurred to support overall research and development\nactivities and include expenses related to general overhead and facilities.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses:\nResearch and Development Expenses Three months ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nExternal expenses:\nManufacturing expense for biological products $ 9,355 $ 4,060\nPhase 3 studies 684 744\nPost-marketing studies 226 184\nEarlier-stage programs 7,481 7,122\nResearch and development employee-related expenses 10,276 8,822\nOther internal research and development expenses 2,031 1,034\nThird-party grants and funding from collaboration agreements (1,809) (3,081)\nTotal research and development expenses $ 28,244 $ 18,885\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to higher expenses at ModeX. This increase was driven\nby a combination of factors, including growth in our BARDA collaboration, advancements and expansion in our early-stage programs, and higher employee-related\nexpenses.\nContingent consideration. Contingent consideration for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was zero, as compared to $1.1 million reversal of expense for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. Contingent consideration for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to changes in assumptions\nregarding the timing of achievement of future milestones for OPKO Renal, and potential amounts payable to former stockholders of OPKO Renal in connection therewith,\npursuant to our acquisition agreement in 2013.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $16.5 million and $16.5 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023. Amortization expense reflects the amortization of acquired intangible assets with defined useful lives. Our indefinite lived IPR&D assets will not be amortized\nuntil the underlying development programs are completed. Upon obtaining regulatory approval by the FDA, the IPR&D assets will be accounted for as a finite-lived\nintangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of\napproximately 12 years.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCorporate\nFor the three months ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 Change % Change\nCosts and expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative $ 12,096 $ 9,938 $ 2,158 22%\nResearch and development 33 13 20 154%\nTotal costs and expenses 12,129 9,951 2,178 22%\nLoss from operations $ (12,129) $ (9,951) $ (2,178) (22)%\nOperating loss for our unallocated corporate operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $12.1 million and $10.0 million, respectively,\nand principally reflect general and administrative expenses incurred in connection with our corporate operations. The increase in operating loss for our unallocated corporate\noperations was primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses.\nOther\nInterest income. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $2.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase in interest\nincome is driven by the yield obtained in our larger cash investment.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased to $17.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.4 million in the same period of 2023.\nThe increase in interest expense was primarily driven by $14.6 million interest incurred on the 2029 Convertible Notes and the 2044 Notes, including amortization of\ndeferred financing and debt issuance costs. This increase was partially offset by the extinguishment of our outstanding 2023 Convertible Notes and the repurchase of the\n2025 Convertible Notes.\nFair value changes of derivative instruments, net. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nwas $1.0 thousand and $88.0 thousand of expense, respectively. Derivative expense was principally related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts at OPKO Chile.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulted in $48.6 million of income compared to $11.7\nmillion of expense for the 2023 period. This was primarily driven by changes in the fair value of our investment in GeneDx Holdings (as defined in Note 6 to our Quarterly\nFinancials). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income of $35.4 million related to this investment, compared to an expense of $8.3 million in\nthe prior-year period. Additionally, we realized a gain of $10.5 million from the sale of 1,386,929 shares of GeneDx during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nForeign currency income of $4.1 million was recorded for the 2024 period, compared with a $3.8 million expense in the 2023 period.\nIncome tax provision. Our income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $23.5 million and $6.1 million, respectively. This\nsignificant increase was primarily driven by a discrete expense related to the BioReference Transaction. While the U.S. federal statutory rate is 21%, our effective tax rate\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from this rate primarily due to the relative mix in earnings and losses in the U.S. versus foreign tax\njurisdictions and operating results in tax jurisdictions which do not result in a tax benefit.\nLoss from investments in investees. We have invested in certain early-stage companies that we perceive to have valuable proprietary technology and significant\npotential to create value for us as an equity holder. We account for these investments under the equity method of accounting, resulting in the recording of our proportionate\nshare of their losses until our share of their loss exceeds our investment. Until the investees’ technologies are commercialized, if ever, we anticipate they will report net\nlosses Loss from investments in investees was $3.0 thousand and $20.0 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n56\nTable of Contents\nFOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nOur consolidated loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\nFor the nine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 Change % Change\nRevenues:\nRevenue from services $ 377,557 $ 391,100 $ (13,543) (3)%\nRevenue from products 117,675 124,553 (6,878) (6)%\nRevenue from transfer of intellectual property and other 34,272 165,938 (131,666) (79)%\nTotal revenues 529,504 681,591 (152,087) (22)%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue 395,653 408,171 (12,518) (3)%\nSelling, general and administrative 237,191 227,676 9,515 4%\nResearch and development 74,789 70,199 4,590 7%\nContingent consideration — (1,023) 1,023 100%\nAmortization of intangible assets 62,290 64,543 (2,253) (3)%\nGain on sale of assets (121,493) — (121,493) (100)%\nTotal costs and expenses 648,430 769,566 (121,136) (16)%\nLoss from operations $ (118,926) $ (87,975) $ (30,951) (35)%\nDiagnostics\nFor the nine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 Change % Change\nRevenues\nRevenue from services $ 377,557 $ 391,100 $ (13,543) (3)%\nTotal revenues 377,557 391,100 (13,543) (3)%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue 325,797 333,463 (7,666) (2)%\nSelling, general and administrative 161,208 153,992 7,216 5%\nResearch and development 1,545 1,843 (298) (16)%\nAmortization of intangible assets 12,943 15,146 (2,203) (15)%\nGain on sale of assets (121,493) — (121,493) (100)%\nTotal costs and expenses 380,000 504,444 (124,444) (25)%\nLoss from operations $ (2,443) $ (113,344) $ 110,901 98%\nRevenue. Revenue from services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately $13.5 million, a decrease of 3.5% compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a $6.5 million reduction in clinical test reimbursement rates and an $7.0 million decrease in clinical\ntest volume, of which $3.3 million was attributable to the BioReference Transaction.\nEstimated collection amounts are subject to the complexities and ambiguities of billing, reimbursement regulations and claims processing, as well as considerations\nunique to Medicare and Medicaid programs, and require us to consider the potential for retroactive adjustments when estimating variable consideration in the recognition of\nrevenue in the period the related services are rendered. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $2.2 million and $19.8 million, respectively,\nof negative revenue adjustments due to changes in estimates of implicit price concessions for performance obligations satisfied in prior periods mainly due to the\ncomposition of patient pay mix.\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe composition of revenue from services by payor for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\nNine months ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nHealthcare insurers $ 229,600 $ 238,934\nGovernment payers 63,561 61,250\nClient payers 71,521 77,973\nPatients 12,875 12,943\nTotal $ 377,557 $ 391,100\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $7.7 million, a decrease of 2.3% compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Cost of revenue decreased primarily due to lower employee headcount, reflecting our continued cost-reduction initiatives implemented at\nBioReference, changes in the mix of testing ordered during the period, and by a decrease in consumption reflecting the timing of the BioReference Transaction.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $161.2\nmillion and $154.0 million, respectively, representing a decrease of 4.7% from the prior period. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily\ndue to severance expense of $26.3 million, offset by a decrease in employee-related expenses, reflecting continued cost-reduction initiatives.\nResearch and development expenses.

Amortization of intangible assets was $12.9 million and $15.2 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to the BioReference Transaction, which impacted the amount of amortizable intangible assets.\nGain on sale of assets. Gain on sale of assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $121.5 million due to the BioReference Transaction that closed\nduring the third quarter of 2024.\nPharmaceuticals\nFor the nine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 Change % Change\nRevenues:\nRevenue from products $ 117,675 $ 124,553 $ (6,878) (6)%\nRevenue from transfer of intellectual property and other 34,272 165,938 (131,666) (79)%\nTotal revenues 151,947 290,491 (138,544) (48)%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue 69,856 74,708 (4,852) (6)%\nSelling, general and administrative 44,264 41,895 2,369 6%\nResearch and development 73,177 68,304 4,873 7%\nContingent consideration — (1,023) 1,023 100%\nAmortization of intangible assets 49,347 49,397 (50) (0)%\nTotal costs and expenses 236,644 233,281 3,363 1%\n(Loss) income from operations $ (84,697) $ 57,210 $ (141,907) (248)%\n58\nTable of Contents\nRevenue from products. Revenue from products for nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $6.9 million or 5.5%, compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. While we experienced higher sales volumes in 2024 compared to 2023, this increase was more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange\nfluctuations of approximately $6.7 million from our international operations, resulting in an overall decrease in revenue. Additionally, revenue from sales of Rayaldee for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $19.9 million compared to $21.7 million recorded in the same period in 2023.\nRevenue from transfer of intellectual property and other. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from the transfer of intellectual property and other\nwas $34.3 million compared to $165.9 million for the prior period. This decrease was primarily due to one-time milestone payments received in 2023, including a $90.0\nmillion payment triggered by the FDA approval of NGENLA (Somatrogon), a $50.0 million payment from Merck for rights granted under the Merck Agreement (as defined\nand described in Note 14 to our Quarterly Financials), a $7.0 million payment from VFMCRP triggered by the German price approval for Rayaldee (as described in Note 14\nto our Quarterly Financials) and a $2.5 million payment from Nicoya due to Nicoya’s submission of the investigational new drug application to China's Center for Drug\nEvaluation pursuant to the Nicoya Agreement (as described in Note 14 to our Quarterly Financials). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from the\ntransfer of intellectual property and other reflects $18.9 million in gross profit share and royalty payments for NGENLA (Somatrogon) and Pfizer's Genotropin®\n(Somatropin), compared with $11.8 million received in the same period in 2023. Furthermore, revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included $12.8\nmillion from the BARDA Contract (as defined and described in Note 14 to our Quarterly Financials).\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $4.9 million, a decrease of 6.5% compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 which was primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange fluctuations. Despite increased sales volumes during the period, which typically increases\ncost of revenue, we were able to achieve this decrease due to a combination of factors. Favorable foreign currency fluctuations positively impacted cost of revenue, and we\nalso realized a $2.6 million reduction in Rayaldee cost of revenue resulting from a lower standard cost per bottle.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $44.3\nmillion and $41.9 million, respectively, an increase of 5.7% from the prior year period. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher\nemployee-related and professional expenses related to our international operations.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $73.2 million and $68.3\nmillion, respectively, an increase of 7.1% from the prior year period. Research and development expenses include external and internal expenses, partially offset by third-\nparty grants and funding arising from collaboration agreements. External expenses include clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations,\nlab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. We track external research and development expenses by individual\nprogram for phase 3 clinical trials for drug approval and premarket approval for diagnostics tests, if any. Internal expenses include employee-related expenses such as\nsalaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses are incurred to support overall research and development\nactivities and include expenses related to general overhead and facilities.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses:\nResearch and Development Expenses Nine months ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nExternal expenses:\nManufacturing expense for biological products $ 22,590 $ 10,039\nPhase III studies 1,332 3,871\nPost-marketing studies 514 342\nEarlier-stage programs 25,505 37,197\nResearch and development employee-related expenses 28,132 25,584\nOther internal research and development expenses 5,969 3,037\nThird-party grants and funding from collaboration agreements (10,865) (11,766)\nTotal research and development expenses $ 73,177 $ 68,304\n59\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily to growth in our BARDA collaboration and higher\nemployee-related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a one-time payment to Sanofi of $12.5 million made in 2023 pursuant to the Sanofi In-License\nAgreement, which was triggered as a result of the Merck Agreement, and lower costs related to Somatrogon (hGH-CTP) following the closure of open-label extension\nstudies in countries where it has received marketing authorization.\nContingent consideration. Contingent consideration for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was zero, as compared to a $1.0 million reversal of expense for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. Contingent consideration for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to changes in assumptions\nregarding the timing of achievement of future milestones for OPKO Renal, and potential amounts payable to former stockholders of OPKO Renal in connection therewith,\npursuant to our acquisition agreement in 2013.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $49.4 million for both for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nAmortization expense reflects the amortization of acquired intangible assets with defined useful lives. Our indefinite lived IPR&D assets will not be amortized until the\nunderlying development programs are completed. Upon obtaining regulatory approval by the FDA, the IPR&D assets will be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset\nand amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of approximately 12\nyears.\nCorporate\nFor the nine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 Change % Change\nCosts and expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative $ 31,719 $ 31,789 $ (70) (0)%\nResearch and development 67 52 15 29%\nTotal costs and expenses 31,786 31,841 (55) (0)%\nLoss from operations $ (31,786) $ (31,841) $ 55 0%\nOperating loss for our unallocated corporate operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $31.8 million and $31.8 million, respectively,\nand principally reflect general and administrative expenses incurred in connection with our corporate operations.\nOther\nInterest income. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $4.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The increase is driven by\nhigher average cash and investment balances as a result of the cash received from the BioReference Transaction and the issuance of the 2044 Notes.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased to $33.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $10.1 million in the same period of 2023.\nThe increase was primarily driven by interest incurred on the 2029 Convertible Notes and the 2044 Senior Secured Notes, including amortization of deferred financing and\ndebt issuance costs. This increase was partially offset by the extinguishment of our outstanding 2023 Convertible Notes in connection with their exchange for 2029\nConvertible Notes and the repurchase of a portion of the 2025 Convertible Notes.\nFair value changes of derivative instruments, net. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was\n$26.2 million and $0.8 million of expense, respectively. Derivative expense was principally related to the change in fair value on the 2029 Convertible Notes and on foreign\ncurrency forward exchange contracts at OPKO Chile.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $128.8 million of income, compared to $16.1 million\nof expense for the 2023 period. Other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, included $118.6 million of income and $19.9 million\nof expense, respectively, as a result of the change in the fair value of our investment in GeneDx Holdings (as defined in Note 6 to our Quarterly Financials). Furthermore,\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflected $8.5 million of income due to GeneDx Holdings reaching specific revenue targets for the fiscal year ending December\n31, 2022. Finally, a foreign currency gain of $0.1 million was recorded for the 2024 period, compared with a $1.8 million loss in the 2023 period.\n60\nTable of Contents\nIncome tax provision. Our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a $21.9 million and $10.5 million, respectively. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the relative mix in earnings and losses in\nthe U.S. versus foreign tax jurisdictions, a discrete expense impact related to the BioReference Transaction, the impact of the payments under Merck Agreement, and\noperating results in tax jurisdictions which do not result in a tax benefit.\nLoss from investments in investees. We have invested in certain early stage companies that we perceive to have valuable proprietary technology and significant\npotential to create value for us as an equityholder. We account for these investments under the equity method of accounting, resulting in the recording of our proportionate\nshare of their losses until our share of their loss exceeds our investment. Until the investees’ technologies are commercialized, if ever, we anticipate they will report net\nlosses. Loss from investments in investees was $7.0 thousand and $99.0 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOn September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately $420.1 million. Cash used in operations of $139.1 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a $121.5 million gain on the sale of assets related to the BioReference Transaction and $94.6 million change in\nfair value from equity securities. We also incurred general and administrative expenses related to our corporate operations and research and development activities. Cash\nfrom investing activities was $236.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected both the proceeds from the BioReference Transaction and the\nsale of equity securities, offset by capital expenditures. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $224.6 million primarily\nreflected net borrowings on our lines of credit, the issuance of our 2029 Convertible Notes, the issuance of the 2044 Notes, the redemption of the 2025 Notes, and\nrepurchase of shares of our Common Stock. We have historically not generated sustained positive cash flow sufficient to offset our operating and other expenses, and our\nprimary sources of cash have been from the public and private placement of equity and debt, as well as credit facilities available to us.\nIn September 2024, ModeX entered into the BARDA Amendment which increased funding by $26.9 million, for the ongoing development, manufacturing, and\nexecution of a Phase 1 clinical trial for a next-generation MSTAR multispecific antibody with broad neutralizing activity against known variants of SARS-CoV-2. The\nBARDA Amendment also included BARDA's exercise of an option for the development of a multispecific protein antibody for influenza or another pathogen, with the\nadditional funding allocated to cover the expanded work. These modifications increased the total value of the BARDA Contract to $110.0 million, with a potential value, of\n$205.0 million if BARDA exercises all options thereunder thereunder to expand MOdeX's services. The BARDA Contract covers a five-year period through February 2028.\nWe expect this funding will support the development of a second novel multispecific antibody to SARS-CoV-2, from preclinical through Phase 1 trials, as well as preclinical\nwork on gene-based expression of multispecific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, including mRNA and/or DNA vectors. In addition, ModeX will begin development of influenza\nmultispecifics with gene and/or protein delivery modalities. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount remaining to be funded by BARDA, which is subject to\nperformance obligations and excluding unexercised contract options, is $96.0 million.\nOn September 16, 2024, the Company consummated the BioReference Transaction, pursuant to which Labcorp acquired select assets of the Company's subsidiary,\nBioReference. Labcorp paid to the Company aggregate consideration of $237.5 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Labcorp Asset Purchase\nAgreement. The assets acquired by Labcorp include BioReference's laboratory testing businesses focused on clinical diagnostics, reproductive health, and women's health\nacross the United States, excluding New York and New Jersey operations.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company sold 1,386,929 shares of GeneDx Holdings common stock at various prices per share for approximately $46.7 million\nin aggregate proceeds. This sale reduced the Company's total ownership in GeneDx Holdings from 13.61% to 8.1% as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe aggregate value of our GeneDx Holdings investment was $92.2 million based on the closing market price of the GeneDx Holdings common stock.\nOn July 18, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our Common Stock. Under this program, we may repurchase shares\nthrough various methods, including open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions and accelerated share repurchases, as well as pursuant to pre-set\ntrading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act, and otherwise in compliance with applicable laws. The timing and volume of repurchases\nwill depend on market conditions, our capital management, investment opportunities, and other factors. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number\nof shares, has no set expiration date, and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at our discretion. In connection with this new authorization, the Company\nrepurchased 14,893,026 shares for $23.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n61\nTable of Contents\nOn July 17, 2024, we completed a private offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of the 2044 Notes in accordance with the terms of the 2044 Note\nPurchase Agreement. The 2044 Notes are secured by the Company’s profit share payments from Pfizer, received under the Restated Pfizer Agreement. The 2044 Notes bear\ninterest at the 3-month SOFR plus 7.5%, subject to a minimum interest rate of 4.0% per annum. The 2044 Notes mature in July 2044, with interest-only payments required\nfor the first four years.\nIn January 2024, we completed a private offering of $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Convertible 144A Notes in accordance with the terms of\nthe 144A Note Purchase Agreement entered into by and between the Company and the Initial Purchaser.\nThe Company received approximately $220.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes, after deducting fees and estimated\noffering expenses. The Company used approximately $50.0 million of the net proceeds to repurchase shares of our Common Stock from purchasers of the 2029 Convertible\n144A Notes in privately negotiated transactions at a purchase price equal to the closing sale price per share of Common Stock on January 4, 2024, which was $0.9067.\nContemporaneously with the pricing of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the\nCompany’s outstanding 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 to repurchase, on the closing date, approximately $144.4 million aggregate principal amount of such\nnotes. The Company effected such repurchases for cash, using $146.3 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2029 Convertible 144A Notes, following which\nonly $170 thousand aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes remained outstanding.\nAdditionally, the Company issued and sold approximately $71.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Convertible Affiliate Notes pursuant to the terms of\nthe Affiliate Note Purchase Agreement by and among the Company and the Affiliate Purchasers. Pursuant to the Affiliate Note Purchase Agreement, the Company issued\nand sold the 2029 Convertible Affiliate Notes to the Affiliate Purchasers in exchange for $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Convertible Notes, held by the\nAffiliate Purchasers, together with approximately $16.1 million of accrued but unpaid interest thereon. Following such exchange, no 2023 Convertible Notes remained\noutstanding.\nHolders may convert their 2029 Convertible Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2028 only\nunder the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2024 (and only during such calendar\nquarter), if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days\nending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on each\napplicable trading day; (2) during the five consecutive business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “convertible note measurement period”) in\nwhich the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the convertible note measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last\nreported sale price of our Common Stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events specified in\nthe indenture governing the 2029 Convertible Notes. On or after September 15, 2028 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity\ndate, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion of a note, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares\nof our Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Common Stock, at our election.\nThe conversion rate is initially equal to 869.5652 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of\napproximately $1.15 per share of Common Stock). The conversion rate for the 2029 Convertible Notes is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events but\nwill not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn March 8, 2023, ModeX, the Company (with respect to certain sections), and Merck entered into the Merck Agreement pursuant to which Merck obtained a license\nto certain patent rights and know-how in connection with the development of ModeX’s preclinical nanoparticle vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein -Barr Virus.\n62\nTable of Contents\nModeX and Merck have established a strategic collaboration with a detailed research plan to guide the development of such a vaccine or related product. This plan\nincludes the creation of a joint steering committee and the potential use of third-party contract development and manufacturing organization carry out such activities unless\notherwise agreed. Merck will reimburse ModeX for development costs incurred as part of this research plan. To date, we have incurred $24.5 million of development costs\nrelated to the Epstein -Barr Virus, for which Merck has provided reimbursement in full.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total commitments under our lines of credit with financial institutions in Chile and Spain were $30.0 million, of which $11.7 million\nwas drawn as of September 30, 2024. On September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on these lines of credit was approximately 5.4%. These lines of credit are\nshort-term and are used primarily as a source of working capital. The highest aggregate principal balance at any time outstanding during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 was $23.6 million. We intend to continue to draw under these lines of credit as needed. There is no assurance that these lines of credit or other funding sources will\nbe available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, in the future.\nSeparately, on September 16, 2024, BioReference fully repaid its obligations and terminated the Credit Agreement as amended and restated. BioReference paid\napproximately $9.7 million to settle its obligations, incurring no prepayment premium or penalty.\nIn connection with our agreements with Merck, Pfizer, VFMCRP, Nicoya and CAMP4, we are eligible to receive various milestone payments and royalty\nconsiderations. Under the terms of the Merck Agreement, we received an initial payment of $50.0 million and are also eligible to receive up to an additional $872.5 million\nupon the achievement of certain commercial and development milestones under several indications. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments ranging from\nhigh single digits to low double digits upon achievement of certain sales targets of the Product (as defined in the Merck Agreement). Under the terms of the Restated Pfizer\nAgreement, we have received or are eligible to receive up to an additional $275.0 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones, including $90 million\ntriggered by the FDA approval in the United States and $85 million due to the commencement of sales of NGENLA (Somatrogon) in Europe and Japan, which we received\nin 2022. In addition, we are eligible to receive regional, tiered gross profit sharing for both Somatrogon (hGH-CTP) and Pfizer’s Genotropin®. Under the terms of the\nVFMCRP Agreement, we are entitled to receive up to an additional $15 million in regulatory milestones and $200 million in milestone payments tied to the launch, pricing\nand sales of Rayaldee, including a $7 million regulatory milestone payment we recorded in the first quarter of 2023 triggered by the German price approval for Rayaldee\nand $3 million regulatory milestone payment we recognized in 2022 following the first sale of Rayaldee in Europe. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered, double-\ndigit royalty payments. Under the terms of the Nicoya Agreement, we received an initial upfront payment of $5 million and are eligible to receive an aggregate of $5 million\ntied to the first anniversary of the effective date of the Nicoya Agreement, of which we have received $2.5 million. Furthermore, we received the additional $2.5 million\nupon Nicoya’s submission of the investigational new drug application to the Center for Drug Evaluation of China in March 2023. We are also eligible to receive up to an\nadditional aggregate amount of $115 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones by Nicoya for the Nicoya Product in the\nNicoya Territory. We are also eligible to receive tiered, double digit royalty payments at rates in the low double digits on net product sales within the Nicoya Territory and in\nthe Nicoya Field. Under the terms of the CAMP4 Agreement, we received an initial upfront payment of $1.5 million.\nWe believe that the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand at September 30, 2024, which includes the amounts received from the sale of the 2044 Notes\nand the BioReference Transaction, are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and debt service beyond the next 12 months. We based this\nestimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong or are subject to change, and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect.\nIf we acquire additional assets or companies, accelerate our product development programs or initiate additional clinical trials, we will need additional funds. Our future\ncash requirements, and the timing of those requirements, will depend on a number of factors, including the approval and success of our products and products in\ndevelopment, particularly our long acting Somatrogon (hGH-CTP) for which we have received approval in over 50 markets, including the United States, Europe, Japan,\nAustralia and Canada, the commercial success of Rayaldee, BioReference’s financial performance, possible acquisitions and dispositions, the continued progress of research\nand development of our product candidates, the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting,\nmaintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing, our success in\ndeveloping markets for our product candidates and results of government investigations, payor claims, existing legal proceedings (including the ITA litigation) and those\nthat may arise in the future. We have historically not generated sustained positive cash flow and if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have\nto delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or possible acquisitions or reduce our marketing or sales\nefforts or cease operations.\n63\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides information as of September 30, 2024, with respect to the amounts and timing of our known contractual obligation payments due by\nperiod.\nRemaining three\nContractual obligations months ending\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total\nOpen purchase orders $ 38,588 $ 4,959 $ 415 $ — $ — $ — $ 43,962\nOperating leases 3,310 12,382 10,874 10,026 9,245 18,961 64,798\nFinance leases 520 1,740 1,316 806 203 1,959 6,544\n2029, 2025 and 2033 Convertible Notes — 170 — — — 178,695 178,865\n2044 notes — — — — — 245,358 245,358\nLines of credit 13,222 — — — — — 13,222\nInterest commitments 2,875 11,387 11,366 11,349 11,363 468 48,808\nTotal $ 58,515 $ 30,638 $ 23,971 $ 22,181 $ 20,811 $ 445,441 $ 601,557\nThe preceding table does not include information where the amounts of the obligations are not currently determinable, including the following:\n• Contractual obligations in connection with clinical trials, which span over two years, and that depend on patient enrollment. The total amount of expenditures\nis dependent on the actual number of patients enrolled and as such, the contracts do not specify the maximum amount we may owe.\n• Product license agreements effective during the lesser of 15 years or patent expiration whereby payments and amounts are determined by applying a royalty\nrate on uncapped future sales.\n• Contingent consideration that includes payments upon achievement of certain milestones including meeting development milestones such as the completion of\nsuccessful clinical trials, NDA approvals by the FDA and revenue milestones upon the achievement of certain revenue targets all of which are anticipated to be\npaid within the next seven years and are payable in either shares of our Common Stock or cash, at our option, and that may aggregate up to $125.0 million.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThere were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Form 10-K that have had a material impact on our Quarterly\nFinancials and related notes.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nAccounting standards yet to be adopted.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which modifies the\nrules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (i) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (ii) the income or loss from continuing operations before\nincome tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (iii) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and\nforeign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state, and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The\nguidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or\nmade available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential\nimpact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n64\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU\n2023-07 enhances disclosures for significant segment expenses for all public entities required to report segment information in accordance with ASC 280. ASC 280 requires\na public entity to report for each reportable segment a measure of segment profit or loss that its chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) uses to assess segment\nperformance and to make decisions about resource allocations. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with updates to be applied on a\nprospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new\nguidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecently adopted accounting standards.\nIn 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) established an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and agreed\non a two-pillar solution (“Pillar Two”) to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation and a 15% global minimum effective tax rate. On December 15, 2022, the EU\nmember states agreed to implement the OECD’s global minimum tax rate of 15%. The OECD issued Pillar Two model rules and continues to release guidance on these\nrules. The inclusive framework calls for tax law changes by participating countries to take effect in 2024 and 2025. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans\nto enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax. We considered the applicable tax law changes on Pillar Two implementation in the relevant countries, and there\nis no material impact to our tax results for the period. We anticipate further legislative activity and administrative guidance in 2024, and will continue to evaluate the\nimpacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in the non-US tax jurisdictions we operate in.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nIn the normal course of doing business, we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk – We operate globally, and we are subject to foreign exchange risk in our commercial operations as portions of our revenues\nare exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily those for the Chilean Peso and the Euro.\nFrom time to time, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. Certain firmly\ncommitted transactions may be hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts. As exchange rates fluctuate, gains and losses on the exposed transactions are partially\noffset by gains and losses related to the hedging contracts. Both the exposed transactions and the hedging contracts are translated and fair valued, respectively, at current\nspot rates, with gains and losses included in earnings. We do not enter into foreign exchange or other derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nOur derivative activities, which consist of foreign exchange forward contracts, are intended to economically hedge forecasted cash flows that are exposed to foreign\ncurrency risk. The foreign exchange forward contracts generally require us to exchange local currencies for foreign currencies based on pre-established exchange rates at the\ncontracts’ respective maturity dates. As exchange rates change, gains and losses on these contracts are generated based on the change in the exchange rates that are\nrecognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and offset the impact of the change in exchange rates on the foreign currency cash flows that are\nhedged. If the counterparties to the exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies, our results of operations could be negatively\nimpacted due to effectively unhedged currency related fluctuations. Our foreign exchange forward contracts primarily hedge exchange rates on the Chilean Peso to the U.S.\ndollar. If Chilean Pesos were to strengthen or weaken in relation to the U.S. dollar, our loss or gain on hedged foreign currency cash-flows would be offset by the derivative\ncontracts, with a net effect of zero.\n65\nTable of Contents\nApproximately 22.3% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (USD). This compares\nto 30.7% for the same period in 2023. Our financial statements are reported in USD; therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates affect the translation of foreign-denominated\nrevenue and expenses. In the first nine months of 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, our most significant currency exchange rate exposures were to the Euro\nand the Chilean Peso. Gross accumulated currency translation adjustments, recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, totaled $36.2 million and 34.6 million\nat September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For information on such open foreign exchange forward contracts for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Results of Operations— Foreign Currency Exchange Rates.”\nWe do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or “other than trading” instruments that are likely to expose us to\nsignificant market risk, whether interest rate, foreign currency exchange, commodity price, or equity price risk.\nInterest Rate Risk – Our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our cash and investments and to our borrowings. We generally maintain an investment portfolio of\nmoney market funds and marketable securities. The securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and are subject to minimal interest rate risk due to their very\nshort-term nature. We currently do not hedge interest rate exposure. Because of the short-term maturities of our investments, we do not believe that a change in interest rates\nwould have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income resulting from declining interest rates.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $420.1 million. The weighted average interest rate related to our cash, cash equivalents\nand restricted cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 3.1%. As of September 30, 2024, the principal outstanding balances under our Chilean\nand Spanish lines of credit was $11.7 million in the aggregate at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%.\nOur outstanding convertible senior notes have fixed rates of interest; therefore, we are not exposed to interest rate risk on those instruments.\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve\nthis objective, we may invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies, bank obligations, repurchase agreements and high-quality\ncorporate issuers, and money market funds that invest in such debt instruments, and, by policy, restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing\nconcentration limits. To minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates, we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than three months.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit\nunder the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a\ncompany in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive\nand principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on management’s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and\nour Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges to the Company’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n66\nTable of Contents\nPART II.
