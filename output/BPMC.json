AYVAKIT's sales momentum has given us the confidence to raise our revenue expectations again this year, estimating that we will end the year between $475 million and $480 million dollars. Ending our first full year of launch at nearly half a billion dollars in revenue positions AYVAKIT to be one of the most successful rare disease launches to-date,\" said Kate Haviland, Chief Executive Officer of Blueprint Medicines. \"AYVAKIT has demonstrated tangible benefits to patients globally, with long-term data further reinforcing the clinically meaningful benefits and well-tolerated profile of a disease-modifying treatment. AYVAKIT's strong revenue ramp coupled with disciplined investment in our most compelling product opportunities, places Blueprint Medicines in a position to realize the significant decline in cash burn this year, while maintaining our focus on long-term growth and value creation.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights and Recent Progress**\n\n**Mast cell disorders**\n\n  * Achieved AYVAKIT net product revenues of $128.2 million for third quarter of 2024, including $113.1 million in the US and $15.1 million ex-US, representing 136 percent growth year-over-year.\n  * Advanced the Phase 1 single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose healthy volunteer study of BLU-808, a highly selective and potent investigational oral wild-type KIT inhibitor, with best-in-class potential for chronic urticaria and other mast cell disorders. Data from the healthy volunteer study, including safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic markers, are anticipated in early 2025.\n  * Presented data at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) conference demonstrating the efficacy of AYVAKIT in patients with moderate and severe indolent SM (ISM) at baseline, and showing the significant disease burden of SM, highlighting the urgency to diagnose and treat.

This updated guidance is based on continued growth in patients on therapy, continued favorability in compliance and other performance factors, and stronger than expected performance outside of the U.S. The company continues to expect that full-year operating expenses and cash burn will decline in 2024 as compared to 2023, and that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, together with anticipated product revenues, will enable the company to maintain a durable capital position to achieve a self-sustainable financial profile.\n\n**Key Upcoming Milestones**\n\nThe company plans to achieve the following remaining milestones by the end of 2024:\n\n_Mast cell disorders_\n\n  * Initiate registration-enabling Part 2 of the HARBOR trial of elenestinib in ISM by the end of this year.\n\n\n\n_Cell cycle inhibition_\n\n  * Continue strategic business development discussions.\n  * Complete Phase 1 combination dose escalation for BLU-222 by end of year to inform registration plans.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n  * **Revenues** : Revenues were $128.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 generated from the net product sales of AYVAKIT/AYVAKYT. Revenues were $56.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, including $54.2 million of net product revenues from sales of AYVAKIT/AYVAKYT and $2.4 million in collaboration, license and other revenues.\n  * **Cost of Sales:** Cost of sales was $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales to our collaboration partner in greater China.\n  * **R &D Expenses: **Research and development expenses were $85.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $110.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to operational efficiency across our portfolio as we execute across our top priority programs and the timing of manufacturing of clinical trial materials. Research and development expenses included $12.6 million in stock-based compensation expenses for the third quarter of 2024.\n  * **SG &A Expenses:** Selling, general and administrative expenses were $89.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $70.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in activities supporting the commercialization of AYVAKIT/AYVAKYT. Selling, general, and administrative expenses included $15.7 million in stock-based compensation expenses for the third quarter of 2024.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $56.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to a net loss of $133.7 million for the third quarter of 2023**.**\n  * **Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and investments were $882.4 million, as compared to $767.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Blueprint Medicines' cash and investments provide a durable capital position which, together with anticipated product revenues, the company believes will enable it to reach a self-sustainable financial profile**.**\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nBlueprint Medicines will host a live conference call and webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET today to discuss third quarter 2024 financial results and recent business activities.

We seek to alleviate human suffering by solving important medical problems in two core focus areas: allergy/inflammation and oncology/hematology. Our approach begins by targeting the root causes of disease, using deep scientific knowledge in our core focus areas and drug discovery expertise across multiple therapeutic modalities. We have a track record of success with two approved medicines, including AYVAKIT®/AYVAKYT® (avapritinib) which we are bringing to patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) in the U.S. and Europe. Leveraging our established research, development, and commercial capability and infrastructure, we now aim to significantly scale our impact by advancing a broad pipeline of programs ranging from early science to advanced clinical trials in mast cell diseases including SM and chronic urticaria, breast cancer and other solid tumors.
