(Nasdaq: GUTS) (“the Company”), a metabolic therapeutics company focused on pioneering new approaches that treat root causes of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), today reported its third quarter 2024 financial results and provided business updates.\n\n“Fractyl is about to embark on what we believe is a catalyst-rich few quarters. At the end of this year, we expect to begin reporting data from the REVEAL-1 open-label cohort of the REMAIN-1 study, which we believe will demonstrate that the significant weight loss and weight maintenance we see in the real world setting in Germany can be replicated in our pivotal studies in the U.S. The strong demand from patients and clinical sites for the REMAIN-1 study underscores a critical unmet need for sustainable treatments for obesity, particularly for long-term weight maintenance,” said Harith Rajagopalan, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Fractyl. “With our Rejuva platform, we are finalizing key in vivo studies to support the Clinical Trial Application (CTA) submission for RJVA-001 in T2D, and if the filing is approved, we plan to initiate a first-in-human study in the first half of 2025. Last week, we were excited to announce the nomination of our first smart GIP/GLP-1 pancreatic gene therapy lead candidate, RJVA-002, which is designed for the treatment of obesity. RJVA-002 is a locally administered AAV9 viral vector that expresses human GIP and GLP-1 hormones from a human insulin promoter. We are confident that our novel pipeline will position us among the leaders in addressing not just short-term weight loss, but also the underlying causes of obesity and T2D, offering patients options that could reduce the need for lifelong treatments.”\n\n**_Recent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones_**\n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\n  * In November 2024, Fractyl presented compelling weight maintenance data from both the Revita and Rejuva platforms at The Obesity Society’s Annual Meeting at ObesityWeek 2024 in San Antonio, Texas. \n    * The oral [presentation](https://ir.fractyl.com/node/7596/pdf) “Islet-Targeted GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Gene Therapy Reduces Fat and Improves Metabolism in Obese Mice” highlighted new preclinical data on sustained weight maintenance and lowering of blood sugar from Rejuva RJVA-001 for 13-weeks – the longest data to-date demonstrating the durable efficacy of RJVA-001.\n    * The poster [presentation](https://ir.fractyl.com/static-files/961cd51c-dc6e-4d6f-bd28-38744a3d1586) “Duodenal Mucosal Resurfacing (DMR) Durably Maintains Weight Loss in Metabolic Disease” showcased compelling results from a pooled data analysis that demonstrated that the majority of patients durably maintained weight loss for one year post Revita procedure.\n\n\n\n**Revita** _®_\n\n  * The Company has completed enrollment of a sufficient number of patients for the mid-point analysis of the REMAIN-1 pivotal study, which is evaluating Revita’s efficacy in maintaining weight loss following discontinuation of GLP-1 therapy.\n  * Fractyl is currently enrolling patients in the REVEAL-1 open-label cohort of the REMAIN-1 study.\n  * In October 2024, Fractyl presented updated weight loss and blood glucose clinical results from the Company’s German Real-World Registry at the Visceral Medicine 2024 meeting of the German Society for Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) in Leipzig, Germany. The clinical results and patient-reported outcomes further support the clinical potential of Revita to deliver sustainable weight loss and metabolic benefits. As of October 2024, 37 patients have been treated with Revita in Germany and 31 have enrolled in the Real-World Registry.\n  * Fractyl plans a controlled expansion in Germany in 2025. Revita has reimbursement authorization through the NUB reimbursement pathway for the treatment of T2D. At the end of October 2024, multiple hospitals had submitted applications for Revita reimbursement authorization from the German government.\n\n\n\n_Upcoming Milestones:_\n\n  * _REMAIN-1:_ REMAIN-1 is a randomized, double-blind pivotal study of Revita versus sham in patients who have lost at least 15% total body weight on tirzepatide therapy, which was initiated in the third quarter of 2024. The Company anticipates reporting open-label data from the REVEAL-1 cohort of REMAIN-1 beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024 and anticipates a mid-point data analysis of REMAIN-1 in the second quarter of 2025.\n  * _REVITALIZE-1:_ REVITALIZE-1 is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center pivotal study of Revita in patients with adequately controlled T2D on at least one glucose lowering agent (GLA). Fractyl continues to enroll patients in the study and expects to report topline results in mid-2025.\n  * _Germany Real-World Registry Study:_ Fractyl plans to continue enrolling patients in its German Real-World Registry Study of Revita for T2D. The Company is planning to disclose additional registry data from a larger number of patients in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Rejuva** _®_\n\n  * Fractyl has nominated its first smart GIP/GLP-1 pancreatic gene therapy lead candidate, RJVA-002, designed for the treatment of obesity. RJVA-002 is a locally administered AAV9 viral vector that expresses human GIP and GLP-1 hormones from a human insulin promoter. RJVA-002 is designed to activate both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, which together play crucial roles in regulating blood sugar and body weight.\n\n\n\n_Upcoming Milestones:_\n\n  * Fractyl anticipates completing key in vivo studies to support the submission of a CTA for RJVA-001, Fractyl’s first nominated GLP-1 pancreatic gene therapy candidate designed for the treatment of T2D, by the end of the year. If the CTA is approved, the Company intends to initiate its first-in-human study in the first half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n**Revenue:** Revenue in both quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was generated from the Company's pilot commercial launch in Germany.\n\n**R &D Expenses:** Research and development expense was $19.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $9.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase during the quarter was primarily due to the progress made in our REMAIN-1 and REVITALIZE-1 clinical studies, continued development of the Rejuva program and increased personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\n\n**SG &A Expenses:** Selling, general and administrative expense was $4.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase during the quarter was primarily due to professional service expenses and other costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company, and increased personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss was $23.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $15.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily attributed to a $9.9 million increase in operating expenses discussed above and a $1.5 million increase in non-cash loss from changes in fair value of notes payable, offset by a $3.3 million increase in non-cash gain from changes in fair value of warrant liabilities as well as a $0.7 million increase in net interest income.\n\n**Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, Fractyl had approximately $84.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Based on our current development plans, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations through expected key company milestones into the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nFractyl will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results and provide business updates on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. ET. A live webcast of the conference call can be accessed in the “Events” section of Fractyl’s website at [ir.fractyl.com.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Cq3B9P95EYGC2Ec4DYHZ9nNCdxNQJ806Tr7m4cKV72upSrS2mrlsG5WAttvkS3x7Wq2sSz3osokAag3CGt2d-w==) The webcast will be archived and available for replay for at least 30 days after the event.\n\n**About Fractyl Health**\n\nFractyl Health is a metabolic therapeutics company focused on pioneering new approaches to the treatment of metabolic diseases, including obesity and T2D.

Revita is designed to remodel the duodenal lining via hydrothermal ablation (i.e., duodenal mucosal resurfacing) to edit abnormal intestinal nutrient sensing and signaling mechanisms that are a potential root cause of metabolic disease. Revita has received a CE mark in Europe and, in January 2022, received reimbursement authorization through NUB in Germany for the treatment of T2D. In the United States, Revita is for investigational use only under US law. Revita has US FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in weight maintenance for people with obesity who discontinue GLP-1 based drugs, as well as in insulin-treated T2D. A pivotal study of Revita in patients with T2D who are inadequately controlled on any glucose lowering agent, REVITALIZE-1, is currently enrolling in the United States and Europe. A pivotal study of Revita in patients with obesity after discontinuation of GLP-1 based drugs, called REMAIN-1, was initiated in the third quarter 2024.\n\n**About Rejuva**\n\nFractyl Health’s Rejuva® platform focuses on developing next-generation adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based, locally delivered gene therapies for the treatment of obesity and T2D. The Rejuva platform is in preclinical development and has not yet been evaluated by regulatory agencies for investigational or commercial use. Rejuva leverages advanced delivery systems and proprietary screening methods to identify and develop metabolically active gene therapy candidates targeting the pancreas. The program aims to transform the management of metabolic diseases by offering novel, disease-modifying therapies that address the underlying root causes of disease.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: GUTS) (the “Company”), a metabolic therapeutics company focused on pioneering new approaches that treat root causes of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), will present new preclinical data on sustained weight maintenance from its Rejuva RJV-001 single-administration GLP-1 pancreatic gene therapy candidate in an oral presentation on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, during The Obesity Society’s Annual Meeting at ObesityWeek 2024 in San Antonio, Texas. The presentation is titled “Islet-Targeted GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Gene Therapy Reduces Fat and Improves Metabolism in Obese Mice.”\n\nRejuva is the Company’s adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based pancreatic gene therapy program (PGTx), designed to enable durable pancreatic production of therapeutic peptides. RJVA-001 is the Company’s gene therapy candidate encoding a Smart GLP-1TM for the treatment of T2D. The presentation at ObesityWeek includes new results from preclinical studies in the well-validated DIO mouse model, providing independent confirmation of the efficacy of the RJVA-001 candidate in the laboratory of Dr. Randy J. Seeley at the University of Michigan Medical School.\n\n“The new results in this model demonstrate the durability of our human GLP-1 expressing RJVA-001 candidate 13 weeks after treatment, which is the longest follow-up for Rejuva so far, and a considerable portion of the mouse lifespan,” said Harith Rajagopalan, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Fractyl. “This latest independent evaluation by a top academic researcher in obesity, Dr. Randy J. Seeley, validates and builds on results we previously reported in the DIO model at 8 weeks. Rejuva has the potential to be a pattern-breaking therapy that can finally deliver on the promise of the GLP-1 mechanism in the treatment of obesity and T2D – as shown by these results.”\n\nThe ObesityWeek presentation will include new results demonstrating:\n\n  * Sustained maintenance of weight loss and blood sugar levels at week 13 in DIO mice receiving RJVA-001 and continuing a high fat diet.\n  * Over 10% of islet cells expressing immunoreactivity for GLP-1 protein following a single treatment of mice with PGTx.\n  * No safety signals observed. \n\n\n\n“GLP-1 drugs have proven efficacious in obesity, but their durability remains a significant challenge because patients typically regain weight upon discontinuing treatment,” said Dr. Randy J. Seeley, Professor of Surgery, Internal Medicine, and Nutritional Sciences at the University of Michigan Medical School, whose laboratory conducted the latest Rejuva study. “These efficacy data in obese mice suggest that RJVA-001, a human GLP-1 gene therapy targeting islets in the pancreas, has the potential to advance the treatment of obesity by offering a durable, single-dose off-ramp from GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs to help maintain weight loss.”\n\nThe Company announces the nomination of RJVA-002 as its first Smart GIP/GLP-1 pancreatic gene therapy lead candidate designed for the treatment of obesity. RJVA-002 is a locally administered AAV9 viral vector that expresses human GIP and GLP-1 hormones from a human insulin promoter.\n\nRJVA-002 is designed to activate both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, which together play crucial roles in regulating blood sugar and body weight.\n\n**About Fractyl Health** Fractyl Health is a metabolic therapeutics company focused on pioneering new approaches to the treatment of metabolic diseases, including obesity and T2D.

The Rejuva platform is in preclinical development and has not yet been evaluated by regulatory agencies for investigational or commercial use. Rejuva leverages advanced delivery systems and proprietary screening methods to identify and develop metabolically active gene therapy candidates targeting the pancreas. The program aims to transform the management of metabolic diseases by offering novel, disease-modifying therapies that address the underlying root causes of disease.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
