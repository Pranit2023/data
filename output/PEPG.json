(Nasdaq: PEPG), a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing the next generation of oligonucleotide therapies with the goal of transforming the treatment of severe neuromuscular and neurological diseases, today reported financial results and recent corporate highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“We are pleased with the progress we have made across our pipeline and organization during the third quarter, as we continued to advance our lead clinical programs and strengthened our leadership team with the addition of Paul Streck to head our research and clinical development efforts. Paul has already made a positive impact on our organization and our clinical development strategy in both myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD),” said James McArthur, PhD, President and CEO of PepGen. Said Paul Streck, MD, MBA, Head of R&D: “In our DM1 program, the 10 mg/kg cohort of our FREEDOM-DM1 study is fully enrolled and we are encouraged by the emerging data from both the 5 and 10 mg/kg cohorts. We look forward to presenting a fulsome update of both cohorts by the end of the first quarter of 2025, followed by additional data readouts expected from the DM1 and DMD programs during 2025.” \n\nContinued Dr. McArthur: “We leveraged the encouraging 5 mg/kg results from our CONNECT1-EDO51 study in DMD reported in July to further optimize the study designs of both CONNECT1 and CONNECT2-EDO51. With these protocol enhancements in place, we expect to report data from the expanded CONNECT1 10 mg/kg cohort before year-end 2025. We remain deeply committed to advancing our programs with the goal of improving the lives of individuals suffering from severe neuromuscular and neurological diseases.” \n\n**Recent Program Updates**\n\n**PGN-EDODM1: Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1**\n\n  * **Phase 1 FREEDOM-DM1 Clinical Trial of PGN-EDODM1** : The FREEDOM Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) study continues, and the Company expects to report safety, splicing correction and functional outcome measures from both the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose cohorts by the end of the first quarter of 2025. The FREEDOM study is evaluating PGN-EDODM1 in approximately 32 adult patients with DM1 in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The Company expects to report results from the 15 mg/kg cohort in the second half of 2025. \n\n\n  * **Phase 2 FREEDOM2-DM1 Clinical Trial of PGN-EDODM1** : FREEDOM2 is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial evaluating PGN-EDODM1 in approximately 24 adult patients with DM1 in Canada, the United Kingdom, and, subject to regulatory clearance, the United States. The Company expects to initiate dosing in FREEDOM2 by year-end. \n\n\n\n**PGN-EDO51: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**\n\n  * **Phase 2 CONNECT1-EDO51 Clinical Trial of PGN-EDO51** : Following encouraging data from the 5 mg/kg cohort reported in July, the Company continues to advance the CONNECT1 study. Based on learnings from the 5 mg/kg cohort, PepGen has amended the CONNECT1 study protocol. The changes include adjusting the timing for the final biopsy from Day 7 to Day 28 following the last dose of PGN-EDO51, adjusting the Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) test entry score from 3 to 4 for inclusion, and adjusting the eligible age group from 8 years of age and older to 6-16 years of age, all subject to regulatory clearance. The Company has also expanded the 10 mg/kg cohort from 3 to 4 participants. With these adjustments, the Company now expects to report results from the 10 mg/kg cohort by year-end 2025. \n\n\n  * **Phase 2 CONNECT2-EDO51 Clinical Trial of PGN-EDO51** : Based on the data from CONNECT1, including the favorable emerging safety profile of PGN-EDO51, the Company is also working to optimize the design of the multinational CONNECT2 Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, MAD, 25-week trial. The CONNECT2 clinical trial is open in the United Kingdom. The Company continues to engage with regulators in the European Union and expects to open the clinical trial in the United States by year-end, subject to regulatory clearance. \n\n\n\n**Corporate Update**\n\n  * In August, PepGen appointed Paul Streck, MD, MBA, as Executive Vice President and Head of the Company’s R&D organization. He brings more than 20 years of leadership experience in drug development, regulatory, and medical affairs. \n  * In September and October, the Company presented scientific and clinical data at numerous medical conferences, including at the 29th Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society. All of the presentations are available on the Investors page of PepGen’s website under Scientific Publications. \n\n\n\n**Financial Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n  * **Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities** were $138.9 million as of September 30, 2024, which is anticipated to fund currently planned operations into 2026. \n  * **Research and Development Expenses** were $17.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $20.5 million for the same period in 2023. \n  * **General and Administrative Expenses** were $5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.2 million for the same period in 2023. \n  * **Net Loss** was $21.4 million, or $(0.66) basic and diluted net loss per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $23.3 million, or $(0.98) basic and diluted net loss per share, for the same period in 2023. PepGen had approximately 32.6 million shares outstanding on September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**About PGN-EDODM1**\n\nPGN-EDODM1, PepGen's investigational candidate in development for the treatment of DM1, utilizes the Company's proprietary Enhanced Delivery Oligonucleotide (EDO) technology to deliver a therapeutic oligonucleotide that is designed to restore the normal splicing function of MBNL1, a key RNA splicing protein. DM1 is a progressively disabling, life-shortening genetic disorder. DM1 is estimated to affect 40,000 people in the United States, and over 74,000 people in Europe. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted PGN-EDODM1 both Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designations for the treatment of patients with DM1. \n\n**About PGN-EDO51**\n\nPGN-EDO51, PepGen's clinical candidate for the treatment of DMD, utilizes the Company's proprietary EDO technology to deliver a therapeutic phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) that is designed to target the root cause of this devastating disease. PGN-EDO51 is designed to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin transcript, an established therapeutic target for approximately 13% of DMD patients, thereby aiming to restore the open reading frame and enabling the production of a truncated, yet functional dystrophin protein. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted PGN-EDO51 both Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations for the treatment of patients with DMD amenable to an exon-51 skipping approach. \n\n**About PepGen**\n\nPepGen is a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing the next generation of oligonucleotide therapies with the goal of transforming the treatment of severe neuromuscular and neurological diseases. PepGen’s EDO platform is founded on over a decade of research and development and leverages cell-penetrating peptides to improve the uptake and activity of conjugated oligonucleotide therapeutics.
