Hence, there is an NDXESG / NGXESG reconstitution and rebalancing each\nquarter.\n• Securities removed from the Nasdaq-100 / Nasdaq Next Generation 100 Index outside of a reconstitution\nare removed from the Nasdaq-100 ESG Index / Nasdaq Next Generation 100 ESG Index and are not\nreplaced.\nSeptember 2024 Reconstitution\nNDXESG / NGXESG Weighting Scheme\n• The Nasdaq-100 ESG Index / Nasdaq Next Generation 100 ESG Index are modified market\ncapitalization-weighted indexes that consider a company’s ESG Risk Rating Score as an adjustment\nfactor.\n• Two factors play into the index weight of an issuer:\n• The Nasdaq-100 / Nasdaq Next Generation 100 Market Value, and\n• The ESG Risk Rating Score.\n• In general, for each issuer:\n• Everything else equal, the higher the weight in the Nasdaq-100 and/or the better the ESG Risk\nRating Score, the higher the weight in the NDXESG Index, and vice versa.

Hence, there is an NDXESG reconstitution and rebalancing each quarter.\n• Securities removed from the Nasdaq-100 Index outside of a reconstitution are removed from the Nasdaq-\n100 ESG Index and are not replaced.\nSeptember 2024 Reconstitution\nNDXESG Weighting Scheme\n• The Nasdaq-100 ESG Index is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that consider a company’s\nESG Risk Rating Score as an adjustment factor.\n• Two factors play into the index weight of an issuer:\n• The Nasdaq-100 Market Value, and\n• The ESG Risk Rating Score.\n• In general, for each issuer:\n• Everything else equal, the higher the weight in the Nasdaq-100 and/or the better the ESG Risk\nRating Score, the higher the weight in the NDXESG Index, and vice versa.\nSeptember 2024 Reconstitution\nNDXESG ESG Exclusions: 8\nNasdaq-100 ESG: Reason(s) for\nSymbol Company Name ICB Industry Nasdaq-100® Weight (%)\nExclusion\nRevenue from military contracting weapons.\nHoneywell\nHON Industrials Involvement in Controversial Weapons: Tailor- 0.88\nInternational\nmade and essential.\nRevenue from military contracting weapon-\nADI Analog Devices Technology 0.75\nrelated products and/or services.\nConstellation Revenue from nuclear production and oil & gas\nCEG Utilities 0.53\nEnergy generation.\nAmerican Electric Revenue from thermal coal power generation,\nAEP Utilities 0.36\nPower nuclear production, and oil & gas generation.\nData as of 9/23/2024.\nSources: Sustainalytics, Nasdaq Global Indexes.\nSeptember 2024 Reconstitution\nNDXESG ESG Exclusions: 8\nNasdaq-100 ESG: Reason(s) for\nSymbol Company Name ICB Industry Nasdaq-100® Weight (%)\nExclusion\nRevenue from oil & gas supporting\nBKR Baker Hughes Energy 0.24\nproducts/services.\nRevenue from oil & gas production.\nFANG Diamondback Energy Energy Involvement in shale energy extraction 0.22\nand/or production.\nRevenue from thermal coal power\ngeneration, nuclear production, oil & gas\nXEL Xcel Energy Utilities 0.22\nproduction, and oil & gas generation.\nARM Arm Holdings Technology ESG Risk Rating Score Unavailable 0.12\nData as of 9/23/2024.\nSources: Sustainalytics, Nasdaq Global Indexes.\nSeptember 2024 Reconstitution\nTop 10 Constituents by Index Weight (%)\nNDXESG NDX\nTop 10 Weight = 50.8% Top 10 Weight = 50.8%\nMicrosoft Apple\n2.4\n2.0 Apple Microsoft\n2.2\n2.5\n2.3 10.5 9.0\nNVIDIA NVIDIA\n2.6\n2.5\nBroadcom Broadcom\n3.2\n2.5\nAmazon.com Meta Platforms\n2.7\nTesla Amazon.com\n5.0 8.2\nNetflix Tesla\n10.5\n5.5\nAMD Costco Wholesale\n5.1\nLinde Alphabet\n7.6\n10.2\nAdobe 5.3 Alphabet\nData as of EOD 9/30/2024.\nSource: Nasdaq Global Indexes\nSeptember 2024 Reconstitution\nSector Exposure by Index Weight (%)\nNDXESG Index Weight by ICB Industry NDX Index Weight by ICB Industry\n1.4\n1.8\n0.3 0.2\n2.4 Technology 3.4 0.4 0.2 Technology\nConsumer\n2.9 Consumer\n3.9 Discretionary\nDiscretionary 4.3\n4.3 Health Care\nHealth Care 4.4\n5.9\nTelecommunications\n6.0\nTelecommunications\nIndustrials\nIndustrials\n15.2 Consumer Staples\n59.8\nConsumer Staples 18.3\n65.0 Basic Materials\nBasic Materials\nUtilities\nUtilities\nEnergy\nReal Estate Real Estate\nData as of EOD 9/30/2024.\nSource: Nasdaq Global Indexes\nSeptember 2024 Reconstitution\nThematic Exposure: Nasdaq-100\n# of Constituents per Theme Index Weight per Theme\nClean Energy Tech + Renewables 12 Clean Energy Tech + Renewables 18.0%\nSustainability Leaders 36 Sustainability Leaders 34.9%\nHealthcare Innovation 3 Healthcare Innovation 1.5%\nBiotech 8 Biotech 4.2%\nCybersecurity 6 Cybersecurity 8.4%\nRobotics 22 Robotics 53.9%\nAI / Big Data 27 AI / Big Data 58.1%\nCloud Computing 15 Cloud Computing 25.1%\nSemiconductors 18 Semiconductors 23.8%\nInternet Economy 13 Internet Economy 38.7%\n5G and Smartphones 14 5G and Smartphones 36.3%\nStreaming 7 Streaming 12.6%\nFinTech Innovation 3 FinTech Innovation 1.0%\nVideo Gaming/eSports & Betting 3 Video Gaming/eSports & Betting 2.2%\nMetaverse 18 Metaverse 50.9%\nDigital Health 1 Digital Health 0.2%\nFuture Mobility 7 Future Mobility 23.4%\nSource: Nasdaq, FactSet.

Otherwise, the following two-stage\nweight adjustment scheme is applied:\nStage 1\nInitial index weights are adjusted to meet the following Stage 1 constraint, producing the Stage 1\nweights:\n• No Index Security weight may exceed 8%.\nStage 2\nStage 1 weights are adjusted to meet the following Stage 2 constraints, producing the final weights:\n• For Index Securities with the five largest market capitalizations, Stage 1 weights are maintained.\n• For all other Index Securities, no weight may exceed 4%.\nThe final weights meet the following constraints:\n• No Index Security weight may exceed 8% of the index; five may exceed 4%.\nPlease refer to the Nasdaq Index Weight Calculations guide for further information.\nINDEX MAINTENANCE\nDeletion policy\nIf, at any time during the year other than the Index Reconstitution(s), an Index Security no longer meets\nthe Eligibility Criteria, or is otherwise determined to have become ineligible for inclusion in the Index, it\nis removed from the Index.
