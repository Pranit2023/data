(“BPY”), we focus on investing in long-life, high-quality assets that form the backbone of the\nglobal economy. Our ESG strategy is centered on supporting business resilience and creating long-term value for our investors and\nshareholders.\nIn 2021, Brookfield Corporation (“BN”), BPY’s parent company, became a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Managers (“NZAM”)\ninitiative to support the goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner. In the second quarter of 2022, we submitted our 2030 net\nzero interim target, which set out our commitment to reduce emissions by two-thirds by 2030 across one-third of our assets under\nmanagement (AUM) from base year. An updated interim progress report will be released with our PRI Assessment later this year. For\nan outline of Brookfield’s commitment to the NZAM initiative and an update on our progress towards our goal of net-zero GHG\nemissions by 2050 or sooner, please refer to our 2022 Sustainability Report.\nAs a signatory of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”), BN published its first TCFD disclosure in the\n2022 Sustainability Report, updated and finalized its risk assessment, incorporating transition and physical scenarios to depict\npotential climate risks and opportunities while evaluating the resilience of its business against various future warming trajectories.\nThis year, Brookfield Real Estate has also published its first Sustainability Report, highlighting sustainability initiatives undertaken\nacross our real estate business, including our efforts towards decarbonization, transitioning toward sustainable energy, creating an\ninclusive working environment, and our governance practices.\nIn addition, eleven Brookfield Real Estate businesses, representing the majority of our real estate assets under management,\nsubmitted to the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (“GRESB”) in 2023, including our core office businesses in North\nAmerica, Australia, the U.K., Germany and India, our core retail business, Canary Wharf Group, and three private funds – Brookfield\nStrategic Real Estate Partners III (“BSREP III”), Brookfield Premier Real Estate Partners (“BPREP US ”), and Brookfield Premier Real\nEstate Partners Europe (“BPREP-E”). In 2024, we expect to expand participation in GRESB to cover additional segments of our real\nestate business.\nWe continue to strengthen our ESG initiatives and integrate\nESG considerations across our portfolio\n3\nKey Sustainability Metrics\nBrookfield is committed to applying sustainable solutions across our portfolio\n100% 100% 134\nof core office of our U.S. office portfolio MWh of solar generating\ndevelopments are LEED will be supplied with GHG capacity being installed\nGold or higher emissions-free electricity by in our logistics portfolio\n2026\n4\nBPY’s Global Green Building Certifications\nBrookfield constantly strives to manage its investments sustainably\n221 104 55 59 52\nCertifications Certifications Certifications in Certifications in Certifications in\nthe U.S. the U.S. and our retail portfolio\nCanada\n45 34 39 25\nCertifications in Certifications Certifications Certifications\nour office portfolio\nNotes:\nAs of December 31, 2022.\nLEED® is the preeminent program for the design, construction, maintenance and operations of high-performance sustainable buildings.

The\ndevelopment is a 2 million square foot, 58-story office building\ndelivered in 2023.\nTwo Manhattan West is expected to achieve LEED Gold certification\nthrough a combination of enhanced energy efficiency, improved indoor\nair quality, high-performance glazing that maximizes daylight, regional\nsourcing for recycled materials and other innovative green initiatives.\nAs of July 2023, Two Manhattan West is powered by 100% renewable\nelectricity. Superior indoor air quality is achieved through careful\nselection of low-emitting materials, the latest industry standards and\nthe provision for ventilation air. Outdoor air is highly filtered and\nspaces which can be sources of emissions, such as maintenance\nclosets and chemical storage rooms, are separated from the\nsurrounding spaces through air-tight construction and have a\ndedicated exhaust. The property used recycled and regionally-\nmanufactured materials and incorporated FSC-certified wood products\nfor at least 50% of the wood installed.\nWater efficiency and stormwater recycling are achieved through a\ncombination of efficient fixture selection and stormwater harvesting\nand recycling. Water for landscaping is significantly reduced through\nthe reuse of water, a careful selection of adaptive, drought-tolerant\nplant species, and through efficient irrigation techniques.\nAccess to natural light, plus views to the exterior, has been provided\nthrough extensive vision glazing and by maintaining the shortest\npractical distance from the exterior to the core walls. A daylight\ndimming system further decreases lighting power requirements.\n10\nOne Leadenhall – BREEAM Outstanding\nOne Leadenhall is a new development adjacent to the historic\nLeadenhall Market that embraces the different ways in which\nindividuals and institutions want to work, unwind and feel at one with\nthe City, designed by the award-winning architecture practice Make.\nExpected to be completed in 2025, this 35-story tower will bring\n430,000 square feet of office space, a free public terrace and ground\nfloor retail to the center of the Square Mile, London.\nOne Leadenhall offers exceptional amenities, such as a sky garden,\nsculpture park, open-air market, fitness space, onsite childcare, and a\nvariety of restaurants, including the highest outdoor dinning terrace in\nEurope with a panoramic view.\nOne Leadenhall is expected to achieve BREEAM Outstanding in\ndesign for the office portion and WELL Silver.\nAs ActiveScore Platinum certified, One Leadenhall has created\noutstanding accessibility by providing 700+ bicycle spaces and\nlockers, electric charging points for vehicles, and enjoying access to\nfour stations within a 5-minute walk with access to underground and\nnational rail.\nOne Leadenhall is being built with solar PV panels and high-\nperformance glazing systems, high visual light transmittance, and\nusing low-emissivity coatings.\nCreating visually interesting planting throughout the year, specimen\nshrub species bring year-round color whilst a range of herbaceous\nplanting provides injections of color throughout the seasons. In\naddition, varied planting ensures a prolonged flowering season that\nattracts birds and insects and provides sheltered nesting opportunities\nwhich enriches the natural habitats in the neighborhood.\n11\nOne the Esplanade – 5 Star NABERS\nOne the Esplanade is a newly developed 29-story premium grade\nproperty in Perth, providing a total of over 600,000 square feet of\noffice and retail space. The entire building was 100% leased prior to\nconstruction completion.\nOne the Esplanade ensures that public spaces are easily accessible\nto visitors all year round. It created a vibrant hub where people can\ngather, interact and enjoy various amenities such as multiple food\nand beverage outlets, end-of-trip facilities, childcare services, a gym\nand a private exhibition space. The inclusion of generous native\nlandscaped spaces not only enhances the site but also provides a\nhabitat to encourage wildlife.\nOne the Esplanade has been deliberately designed to achieve\nenvironmental success.\nThe project targets to achieve 5 Star NABERS Water, Energy, Indoor\nEnvironment Quality rating, 6 Star Green Star rating, and a IWBI\nWELL Gold Core rating.\nThroughout construction, it achieved 45% reduction in GHG\nemissions along with 90% of waste generated during construction\nand demolition diverting from landfill.\nIt is designed to reduce lighting power density by 50%, peak\nelectricity demand by 30%, and potable water consumption by 50%.\nOne the Esplanade has also installed a grey water system, recycling\nand treating water from sinks and showers for use in cooling towers,\nas well as irrigation and toilet flushing. Furthermore, the project\ncaptures and processes rainwater for onsite use.\n12\nBay Adelaide North – LEED Platinum\nBay Adelaide North is the third and final tower in the Bay Adelaide\nCentre complex, located in Toronto’s financial core. Bay Adelaide\nNorth is a 32-story office building, with a nine-story podium, and\n820,000 square feet, delivered in 2022.\nBay Adelaide North has achieved LEED Platinum certification and\nincludes a glazed curtain wall with a metal panel envelope system and\nbest-in-class operational, environmental and life-safety systems.\nThe Deep Lake Water Cooling (“DLWC”) system by Enwave is\ncurrently used across the entire Bay Adelaide Centre campus. The\nDLWC system is a sustainable alternative to air conditioning, which\ndraws renewable cold water from nearby Lake Ontario to cool\nbuildings. Compared to a chiller, DLWC can reduce electricity\nconsumption by 80%.\nEnwave builds and operates a hot water plant that generates heat\nfrom both natural gas and electrically powered heat pumps to enhance\nresiliency and optimize energy use. A supplemental heat pump\ncaptures residual heat from the DLWC system and recycles it to heat\nthe property.\nBay Adelaide North has a south-facing view of Arnell Plaza, which is a\nhalf-acre of open space and Cloud Gardens Park. The property\nfeatures direct access to subways and to the downtown Toronto PATH\nunderground pedestrian system.\nBay Adelaide North provides 400 bicycle storage facilities and 30\npreferred parking spaces for electric, hybrid, and carpooling vehicles\nfor the users of the complex.\n13"
