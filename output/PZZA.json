Business\n\nGeneral\n\nPapa John’s International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as the “Company,” “Papa John’s,” “Papa Johns” or in the first person notations of “we,” “us” and “our”), operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants and, in certain international markets, dine-in and delivery restaurants under the trademark “Papa Johns.” Papa John’s began operations in 1984. At December 31, 2023, there were 5,906 Papa John’s restaurants in operation, consisting of 648 Company-owned and 5,258 franchised restaurants operating in 50 countries and territories. Our Company-owned restaurants include 98 restaurants operated under three joint venture arrangements. In discussions of our business, “Domestic” is defined as within the contiguous United States, “North America” includes Canada, and “International” includes the rest of the world other than North America.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe are committed to delivering on our brand promise “BETTER INGREDIENTS. BETTER PIZZA.®” and a business strategy designed to drive sustainable long-term, profitable growth. Papa John’s is driven by five strategic priorities: \n\nBuild a culture of leaders who believe in diversity, inclusivity and winning. A diverse, inclusive environment is essential to attracting the talent that makes Papa Johns the world’s best pizza delivery company. See the “Human Capital” section below where we discuss our ongoing initiatives in this area.\n\nRe-establish the superiority of our pizza via commercial platforms. We believe that using high quality ingredients leads to superior quality pizzas. Our original crust pizza dough is made from six simple ingredients and is fresh, never frozen. We also top our pizzas with our signature pizza sauce made with vine-ripened tomatoes, real cheese and meat full of flavor, not filler. Our marketing and menu strategies focus on craveable products that provide both value and variety to our customers, drive sales and importantly, do not add significant complexity to our restaurant operations or to supply chain needs. We continue to make purposeful additions to our menu, ensuring these additions are well-timed for our growth, without sacrificing our premium quality. This deliberate strategy focuses on innovation that adds value to our system rather than short-term discounts, contributing to more productive ticket growth and, most importantly, higher customer satisfaction. We believe in the importance of providing options that appeal to our customers’ diverse dietary needs and preferences, and our nutritionists and food innovation teams are continuously looking for ways to reflect this in our menu. Our product innovations form the foundation of our strategy for growing comparable sales and improving unit economics. \n\nImprove unit-level profitability and performance of our Company and franchisee restaurants. We continue to take proactive steps to drive profitable growth through targeted strategies. This includes growing ticket and transactions through menu innovations, customer insights, media efficiency, strategic pricing actions and development incentives. In addition to increasing average unit volumes, our strategy focuses on further sharpening our execution and driving BETTER customer experience for faster service while optimizing labor allocation, enhancing operational efficiencies and effectively managing margins. \n\nWe continue to look for ways to incent growth and improve restaurant margins. Beginning in 2024, we will increase the fixed operating margin that our Domestic commissaries charge. At the same time, we are offering new opportunities for our franchisees to earn annual incentive-based rebates as they increase volume and open new restaurants, which will drive continued supply chain productivity for our system. See “Recent Business Matters” in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nLeverage our technology infrastructure to drive our business operations.We utilize technology to deliver a better customer experience, improve operational efficiencies and inform our decision-making. Approximately 85% of our Domestic sales are through digital channels, including website, apps, third party aggregators, and centralized call centers. We believe that this technology leadership edge provides a competitive advantage when compared with other QSR models. We continue to invest in technology and data science to enhance our digital capabilities for both our customers as well as our employees. We remain committed to meeting customers where they want to order from us and to giving them high quality innovative products, providing great value, and delivering excellent service, regardless of the channel in which they order. \n\nOur loyalty program (“Papa Rewards”) and one-to-one marketing platforms help us retain loyal customers and drive frequency and ticket on our own ordering channels. We have also been a leader in the use of third-party domestic delivery \n\n3\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\naggregators since 2019. As new national pizza chains arrive on the platform, the pizza category has continued to expand its share of the overall aggregator market because it’s a great product for home delivery. Our integrations with the aggregator marketplaces and our nationwide integration with a third-party delivery service provider have been key tools allowing us to continue to meet our customers in the channel of their choice. The “on-demand” labor that the aggregators provide through their “delivery as a service” model allows us to increase our volume in growing day parts like lunch and late night, when the unpredictable demand can make it difficult to predict staffing needs.\n\nProfitably expand our footprint domestically and internationally. We continue to pursue a growth strategy by expanding our footprint, both domestically and internationally. We partner with growth-oriented operators to expand into new regions and markets, seeking to ensure our partners are aligned with our strategic priorities and committed to the Papa Johns brand. The majority of our top-25 North American franchisees have development agreements in place. As part of our previously announced International Transformation initiative, we are evolving our International business structure to strengthen our operational effectiveness and better position our key markets for profitable growth. These steps include establishing International regional hubs, increasing technology investments and optimizing our UK business model. See “Recent Business Matters” in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 16. Restructuring and 25. Subsequent Events to the Financial Statements for additional details. \n\nA large majority of Papa John’s restaurants are franchised. We believe a franchised model provides resiliency of earnings and presents us with an opportunity to enhance growth with less capital investment than a traditional company-operated restaurant model. We seek to attract and retain franchisees with experience in restaurant or retail operations and with the financial resources and management capabilities to open and operate multiple locations. While each Papa John’s franchisee manages and operates its own restaurants and business, we devote significant resources to providing franchisees with assistance in restaurant operations, quality assurance, technology, training, marketing, site selection and restaurant design. Papa John’s franchise owners benefit from our award-winning brand, food service capabilities and the Papa John’s digital and delivery model. \n\nWe recently introduced a new development incentive for our U.S. franchisees designed to accelerate unit growth in 2024 and 2025 and reward growing franchisees. Qualified openings will be eligible for a reduction in Papa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”) contributions over a multi-year period. The value of this incentive is intended to significantly improve restaurant profitability in the initial years of operations, thus improving overall unit economics, strengthening the business case for new store development. We also introduced a new marketing strategy, lowering total advertising fees paid by franchisees while improving efficiency and return on ad spend.  See “Recent Business Matters” in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nSegment Overview\n\nPapa John’s has four defined reportable segments: Domestic Company-owned restaurants, North America franchising, North America commissaries (Quality Control Centers), and International.\n\nDomestic Company-owned Restaurants \n\nThe Domestic Company-owned restaurant segment consists of the operations of all Domestic Company-owned restaurants and derives its revenues principally from retail sales of pizza, Papadias, and side items, including breadsticks, Papa Bites, cheesesticks, boneless chicken wings and bone-in chicken wings, dessert items and canned or bottled beverages. Of the total 3,433 North American restaurants open as of December 31, 2023, 531 units, or approximately 15%, were Company-owned. In 2023, the 512 Domestic Company-owned restaurants included in the full year’s comparable restaurant base generated average annual unit sales of $1.4 million.\n\nOperating Company-owned restaurants allows us to improve operations, training, marketing and quality standards for the benefit of the entire Papa John’s system.\n\nNorth America franchising \n\nThe North America franchising segment consists of our franchise sales and support activities and derives its revenues from the sale of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our franchisees located in the United States and Canada. Our North American franchised restaurants, which included 2,519 restaurants in the full year’s comparable base for 2023, generated average annual unit sales of $1.2 million. These sales, while not included in the Company’s revenues, contribute to our royalty revenues, franchisee marketing fund contributions, and commissary revenue. \n\n4\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nNorth America commissary\n\nThe North America commissary segment comprises 11 full-service regional dough production and distribution centers (Quality Control Centers, or “QC Centers”) in the United States, which supply pizza sauce, dough, food products, paper products, smallwares and cleaning supplies twice weekly to each traditional restaurant served. This system enables us to monitor and control product quality and consistency while lowering food and other costs. We also have one QC Center in Canada, which produces and distributes fresh dough. We evaluate the QC Center system capacity in relation to existing restaurants’ volumes and planned restaurant growth, and facilities are developed or upgraded as operational or economic conditions warrant. To ensure consistent food quality, each Domestic franchisee is required to purchase dough and pizza sauce from our QC Centers and to purchase all other supplies from our QC Centers or other approved suppliers.\n\nInternational \n\nThe International segment is defined as all restaurant operations outside of the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2023, there were 2,473 International restaurants, comprised of 117 Company-owned restaurants in the UK and 2,356 franchised restaurants. The Company currently operates one International QC Center in the UK. The International segment also consists of distribution sales to Papa John’s restaurants located in the UK and our franchise sales and support activities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our International franchisees. Other QC Centers outside North America are operated by franchisees pursuant to license agreements or by other third parties. \n\nAll others\n\nAll other business units that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments, which are not operating segments, are referred to as “all others.” These consist of operations that derive revenues from franchise contributions to our marketing funds and the sale, principally to Company-owned and franchised restaurants, of information systems and related services used in restaurant operations, including our point-of-sale system, online and other technology-based ordering platforms, and printing and promotional items. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company sold Preferred Marketing, our previously wholly-owned print and promotions company. See “Note 22.

We have co-developed Domestic markets with some franchisees or divided markets among franchisees and will continue to use market co-development in the future, where \n\n5\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nappropriate. Our Domestic Company-owned markets are comprised of strong performing restaurants and make them attractive locations either as Company-owned or franchised. \n\nOur experience in developing markets indicates that market penetration through the opening of multiple restaurants in a particular region results in increased average restaurant sales over time. We will establish a development or a master franchise agreement with a franchisee for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area. Similarly to our Domestic Company-owned restaurant growth strategy, our International strategy has shown to build higher consumer awareness, increased market share, and improved operational efficiencies. \n\nIn the second and third quarters of 2023, we acquired 118 formerly-franchised restaurants in the UK as Company-owned restaurants. We recently announced International Transformation initiatives intended to enhance the profitability and cash flow of our UK portfolio and ensure alignment of the region and its performance with our long-term strategy. See “Recent Business Matters” in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 16. Restructuring and 25. Subsequent Events to the Financial Statements for additional details. \n\nFranchise Program\n\nWe continue to attract qualified and experienced franchisees, whom we consider to be a vital part of our system’s continued growth. We believe our relationship with our franchisees is fundamental to the performance of our brand and we strive to maintain a collaborative relationship with our franchisees. Franchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant’s business background, restaurant operating experience and financial resources. \n\nNorth America Development and Franchise Agreements. We enter into development agreements with our franchisees in North America for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area. A franchise agreement is generally executed once a franchisee secures a location. Our current standard franchise agreement requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 5% of sales, and the majority of our existing franchised restaurants have a 5% contractual royalty rate in effect. Incentives offered from time to time to franchisees may reduce the contractual royalty rate paid. \n\nSubstantially all existing franchise agreements have an initial 10-year term with a 10-year renewal option. We have the right to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons, including a franchisee’s failure to make payments when due or failure to adhere to our operational policies and standards. However, many state franchise laws limit our ability as a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise.\n\nInternational Development and Franchise Agreements. In international markets, we have either a development agreement or a master franchise agreement with a franchisee for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area. Under a master franchise agreement, the franchisee has the right to sub-franchise a portion of the development to one or more sub-franchisees approved by us. \n\nOur current standard international master franchise and development agreements provide for payment to us of a royalty fee of 5% of sales. For international markets with sub-franchise agreements, the effective sub-franchise royalty received by the Company is generally 3% of sales and the master franchisee generally receives a royalty of 2% of sales. The remaining terms applicable to the operation of individual restaurants are substantially equivalent to the terms of our Domestic franchise agreement. In certain cases, development agreements may be negotiated at other-than-standard terms for fees and royalties, and we may offer various development and royalty incentives.\n\nFranchise Operations. All franchisees are required to operate their Papa John’s restaurants in compliance with our policies, standards and specifications, including matters such as menu items, ingredients, and restaurant design. Franchisees have full discretion in human resource practices, and generally have full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers, but we generally have the authority to set maximum price points for nationally advertised promotions.\n\nFranchisee Loans. Selected Domestic and International franchisees have borrowed funds from us, principally for the purchase of restaurants from us or other franchisees or, in certain international markets, for construction and development of new restaurants. Loans made to franchisees can bear interest at fixed or floating rates and in most cases are secured by the fixtures, equipment and signage of the restaurant and/or are guaranteed by the franchise owners. At December 31, 2023, net loans outstanding totaled $17.5 million. See “Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\n\n6\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nMarketing Programs\n\nOur Domestic marketing strategy consists of national advertising via television, print, direct mail, digital, mobile marketing and social media channels. Our digital marketing activities have increased significantly over the past several years in response to increasing customer use of online and mobile technology. Local advertising, such as television, radio, print, direct mail, store-to-door flyers, digital, mobile marketing and local social media channels is optional for franchisees. \n\nDomestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s restaurants within a defined market may, but are not required to, join an area advertising cooperative (“Co-op”). Each member restaurant contributes a percentage of sales to the Co-op for market-wide programs, such as television, radio, digital and print advertising, and sports sponsorships. The rate of contribution and uses of the monies collected are determined by a majority vote of the Co-op’s members. \n\nThe national marketing efforts are supported by media, print, digital and electronic advertising materials that are produced by Papa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”), our national marketing fund. PJMF is a consolidated nonstock corporation, designed to operate at break-even for the purpose of designing and administering advertising and promotional programs for all participating Domestic restaurants. PJMF produces and buys air time for Papa John’s national television commercials and advertises the Company’s products through digital media including banner advertising, paid search-engine advertising, mobile marketing, social media advertising and marketing, text messaging, and email. PJMF also engages in other brand-building activities, such as consumer research and public relations activities. Domestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s restaurants are required to contribute a certain minimum percentage of sales to PJMF. \n\nIn international markets, our marketing focuses on reaching customers who live or work within a small radius of a Papa John’s restaurant. Our international markets use a combination of advertising strategies, including television, radio, print, digital, mobile marketing and local social media depending on the size of the local market.\n\nHuman Capital \n\nOur team members are critical to our success. As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 13,200 persons, of whom approximately 10,600 were team members at Company-owned restaurants, approximately 700 were management personnel at Company-owned restaurants, approximately 700 were corporate personnel and approximately 1,200 were QC Center team members. Our team members are non-unionized, and most restaurant team members work part-time and are paid on an hourly basis. \n\nOur franchisees are independent business owners, so their employees are not our employees and therefore are not included in our employee count.We estimate the total number of persons in the Papa John’s system, including our team members, franchisees and the team members of franchisees, was approximately 107,000 as of December 31, 2023.\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nAt Papa Johns, we welcome a wide array of voices to our table. A diverse, inclusive environment is essential to attracting the talent that makes Papa Johns the world’s best pizza delivery company. As such, we welcome all entrepreneurial spirits, innovators and pizza lovers. We continue to build a culture that reflects our corporate values of People First and Everyone Belongs and creates a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining talent. Across our restaurants, QC Centers and corporate hubs, Papa Johns team members are valued for their contributions, treated equitably, encouraged to share their feedback and ideas, provided the tools needed to ensure their safety and total wellness and given ample opportunities to grow in their careers. Papa Johns has received several external recognitions for 2023 for its efforts in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion, The Best Employers for Diversity and World’s Best Employers 2023 by Forbes and America’s Greatest Workplaces for Diversity, Women, LGBTQ+ and Job Starters 2023 by Newsweek. \n\nCreating an inclusive and diverse culture that supports and values team members is important to attracting and retaining talented, dedicated employees. We have implemented initiatives to diversify our workforce and leadership pipeline by recruiting, developing and supporting talent who represent our customers and communities, to embed policies and practices that ensure fairness, build trust and hold ourselves accountable, and to instill and reward behaviors across the organization that foster belonging and increase employee engagement, including required unconscious bias training for team members, and annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) training for all team members, grant-making through the Papa John’s Foundation to national and local nonprofit partners for advancing DEI, our annual Week of Service and our eight global inclusion resource groups with leaders engaging across the organization. \n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nTalent Attraction, Retention and Development\n\nOur ability to attract and retain hourly employees in our restaurants has become more challenging, especially as the job market has become more competitive. Our goal to help all Papa John's employees succeed begins with efforts to attract and recruit a wide range of people from different backgrounds, cultures, education experiences, religions and other indicators of diversity because we know a workforce that reflects the diversity of our customers and communities brings more innovative thinking and better ideas and solutions to our business. To meet job candidates where they live, and gain a deeper understanding of their personal, educational and professional goals, we sponsor and attend job fairs, scholarship programs and university and professional organization events and offer our team members hiring and referral bonuses. Our recruiting strategy aims to diversify the candidate pool for all manager level and above positions. \n\nTo help our team members succeed in their roles and to ensure consistent operational execution, we offer continuous training and development opportunities, including providing innovative tools and materials for the operational training and development of team members. Operations personnel complete our management training program and ongoing development programs, including multi-unit training, through which instruction is given on all aspects of our systems and operations. In addition, to further support our team members’ development, we established our Dough & Degrees program, which allows our team members to earn a college degree for free or at a reduced tuition in partnership with Purdue University Global and the University of Maryland Global Campus, among others. Employees working at least ten hours per week can obtain their High School Diplomas, learn English as a second language, and earn associate’s, bachelor’s and/or master’s degrees. We also offer a tuition reimbursement program that provides another opportunity for our team members to advance their careers. \n\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nOne of our core values is People First. As such, we are committed to providing competitive pay and benefits to attract and retain talent, whether in our Domestic Company-owned restaurants, in our supply chain centers or in our corporate offices. We pay competitive wages to our front line team members in our Domestic Company-owned restaurants.\n\nPapa John’s offers a comprehensive benefits package to eligible team members. We also make available to our team members several benefits designed to promote an inclusive workplace like paid parental leave, adoption support, and health plans that are available to dependents, spouses, and domestic partners. We offer eligible team members a 401(k) plan, with a competitive Company matching component to encourage retirement savings.\n\nBeyond basic insurance programs, Papa John’s offers wellness services to help team members manage and optimize their health and well-being. These no-cost programs include smoking cessation, diabetes and hypertension management, weight management, and mental health support through Papa John’s employee assistance program for all part-time and full-time team members and their dependents. Papa John’s also makes available the “Papa Cares” program that provides corporate office team members an onsite health clinic that provides a wide range of primary care services for adults, adolescents and children. \n\nWorkplace Health and Safety\n\nAs part of the Company’s enterprise-wide safety management system, we invest in training, technology and people to protect both our customers and team members. All Papa John’s team members, from those at our corporate offices to those working in our warehouses and restaurants, receive annual safety training based on the requirements of their roles. Our QC Centers and restaurant operations undergo annual safety audits, as well as random safety checks by regional safety managers and field safety coordinators. \n\nIndustry and Competition\n\nThe United States Quick Service Restaurant pizza (“QSR Pizza”) industry is mature and highly competitive with respect to price, service, location, food quality, customer loyalty programs and product innovation. The QSR Pizza category is largely fragmented, and competitors include a few large national chains and many smaller regional chains, as well as a large number of local independent pizza operators, any of which can utilize a growing number of food delivery services. Some of our competitors have been in existence for substantially longer periods than Papa John’s, have substantially greater resources than Papa John’s and can have higher levels of restaurant penetration and stronger, more developed brand \n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nawareness in markets where we compete. Competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery concepts also continues to increase. For more information, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Industry and Macroeconomic Risks—Our profitability may suffer as a result of intense competition in the QSR Pizza industry.”\n\nInternationally, the pizza delivery model is not as mature as that of the Domestic market and presents a growth opportunity for Papa John’s. We believe demand from international consumers will continue to increase as the demand for pizza delivery and carryout continues. We continue to execute on our growth strategy and expand throughout the world. \n\nWith respect to the sale of franchises, we compete with many franchisors of restaurants and other business concepts. There is also active competition for management personnel, drivers and hourly team members, and attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for Papa John’s restaurants.\n\nSupply Chain\n\nIn the United States, our 11 QC Centers produce dough and distribute substantially all key ingredients, including mozzarella, dough and pizza sauce, and other supplies, including food products, paper products, smallwares and cleaning supplies to Domestic Company-owned restaurants and franchised restaurants to ensure consistent food quality. Each Domestic franchisee is required to purchase pizza sauce and dough from our Domestic QC Centers, and purchases substantially all other food products from our QC Centers. We also have one QC Center in Canada that produces and distributes fresh dough, which provides further support to our North American franchisees. In our International segment, we operate one International QC Center in the UK and other International QC Centers are operated by franchisees pursuant to license agreements or by other third parties. We depend on a sole source for our supply of garlic sauce and we source other key ingredients, including meat products, from a limited number of suppliers. For a discussion of the related risks, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Company Risks—Increase in ingredient and other operating costs, including those caused by weather, climate change and food safety, could adversely affect our results of operations,” “—Our dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers for some ingredients and other supplies could result in disruptions to our business,” and “—Changes in purchasing practices by our Domestic franchisees, or prolonged disruptions in our QC Center operations, could harm our commissary business.” \n\nGovernment Regulation\n\nWe, along with our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses, including laws and regulations related to our marketing and advertising as well as the preparation and sale of food, food safety and menu labeling. Each Papa John’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant in a particular area. Our QC Centers are licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and the operation of our trucks is subject to federal and state transportation regulations. We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations. In addition, our Domestic operations are subject to various federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, benefits, taxation, working conditions, citizenship requirements, and overtime.\n\nWe are subject to Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The laws of several states also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information. State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a significant number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the U.S. franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects if such bills were enacted. State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship. National, state and local government regulations or initiatives, including health care legislation, “living wage,” or other current or proposed regulations, and increases in minimum wage rates affect Papa John’s as well as others within the restaurant industry. We are also subject to applicable laws in each non-US jurisdiction in which we operate.\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nPrivacy and Data Protection\n\nWe are subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally. The legal and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increase in attention given to privacy and data protection issues with the potential to impact our business. This includes recently enacted laws and regulations in the United States and in other countries which require notification to individuals and government authorities of breaches involving certain categories of personal information. Any changes in privacy and data protection laws or regulations could also adversely impact the way we use e-mail, text messages and other marketing techniques and could require changes in our marketing strategies. We have a privacy policy posted on our website at www.papajohns.com. The security of our financial data, customer information and other personal information is a priority for us.\n\nTrademarks, Copyrights and Domain Names\n\nWe protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, foreign intellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. From time to time, we are made aware of the use by other persons in certain geographical areas of names and marks that are the same as or substantially similar to our marks. It is our policy to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to vigorously oppose any infringement of our marks.\n\nWe hold copyrights in authored works used in our business, including advertisements, packaging, training, website, and promotional materials. In addition, we have registered and maintain Internet domain names, including “papajohns.com,” and country code domains patterned as “papajohns.cc,” or a close variation thereof, with “.cc” representing a specific country code.\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n\nWe are not aware of any federal, state, local or international environmental laws or regulations that we expect to materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environment legislation or regulations on our operations. During 2023, we had no material environmental compliance-related capital expenditures, and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2024.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nAll of our periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are available, free of charge, through our website located at www.papajohns.com.

Risk Factors \n\nWe are subject to risks that could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks could cause actual operating results to differ from those expressed in certain “forward-looking statements” contained in this Form 10-K as well as in other Company communications. You should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all other information included in this Form 10-K and our other publicly filed documents.\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nIndustry and Macroeconomic Risks\n\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. \n\nOur financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control. An economic downturn or recession, including deterioration in the economic conditions in the U.S. or international markets where we or our franchisees operate, or a slowing or stalled recovery therefrom, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including a reduction in the demand for our products, longer payment cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Poor economic conditions have in the past adversely affected and may in the future affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could also disrupt our business and adversely affect our results. Higher inflation, and a related increase in costs, including elevated interest rates, as well as currency restrictions and changes in foreign exchange rates, have impacted our franchisees and their ability to pay royalties, open new restaurants or operate existing restaurants profitably. As we navigate this environment, we may need to offer support for certain franchisees in the form of royalty relief, loans or other support, close unprofitable restaurants or markets, and/or consider other alternatives such as acquiring or purchasing franchised restaurants, QC Centers or operations to operate them until they can be refranchised. In addition, adverse macroeconomic conditions, unforeseen geopolitical events, and other business-related changes in circumstances outside of our control have required us to close restaurants in the past and impacted our ability to collect royalties and/or achieve our net unit development targets.\n\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been and could continue to be adversely affected by depressed economic and business conditions in the United Kingdom. There are approximately 500 Papa John’s restaurants located in the United Kingdom, and we also operate an International QC Center in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Company’s UK subsidiary also holds the master leases for nearly all of the corporate and franchise restaurant locations, which exposes us to rent liability. During 2022 and 2023, our business in the United Kingdom was subject to adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, elevated interest rates, the energy crisis, slowing economic growth, and volatile exchange rates, which resulted in negative comparable sales and a challenging operating environment for our franchisees. These challenges also impacted the financial condition of our UK franchisees. We expect some of these conditions to continue in 2024. As we navigate this challenging economic environment, we are investing in capabilities to improve our operations and working to re-position the franchise base to further strengthen our business in the United Kingdom by exiting poorly performing franchisees and permanently closing certain restaurants. We also established a Company-owned restaurant portfolio in the United Kingdom in 2023, acquiring 118 Papa Johns restaurants in an effort to re-position the market. These Company-owned restaurants have incurred operating losses as we continue to evaluate current operational capabilities and implement improvements in revenue management capabilities, product and technological innovation and operational efficiencies to improve sales and restaurant-level profitability over the longer term. If our efforts to re-position the franchise base or improve the profitability of our Company-owned restaurants are unsuccessful, we might need to find new operators for certain unprofitable restaurants and/or close unprofitable locations in the future, which would trigger certain lease and/or loan impairments, and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations in the region. In addition, the Company has provided financial support to certain franchisees in the United Kingdom, including in the form of marketing support and loans. This franchisee support may not be sufficient to keep restaurants in the United Kingdom from closing, particularly if current economic conditions worsen, or our franchisees may not be able to repay their loans, pay royalties, and/or make rent payments under sub-leases with us. The Company is unable to predict the duration or the extent of the macroeconomic deterioration in the United Kingdom or the extent to which our corporate and franchised restaurants will be impacted.\n\nWe are also subject to ongoing risks and uncertainties associated with the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (referred to as “Brexit”), including implications for the free flow of labor and goods in the United Kingdom and the European Union and other financial, legal, tax and trade implications.\n\nWe have recently acquired Company-owned restaurants in the United Kingdom, and are subject to increased risks presented by owning and operating restaurants internationally.\n\nWe recently acquired formerly-franchised Papa Johns restaurants located in the United Kingdom, and may purchase additional restaurants in the United Kingdom. Previously, all of the Papa Johns restaurants located in our International operations segment were franchised. As a result, the Company is exposed to risks of owning and operating restaurants located in the United Kingdom, including those related to business licensing and administrative challenges, lease liabilities, international economic and political conditions, currency regulations and fluctuations, compliance with international privacy and information security laws and regulations, the ability to adapt to differing cultures or consumer preferences, diverse government regulations and tax systems, the ability to identify, attract and retain experienced management and \n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nemployee populations, and other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development or operation of the restaurants.\n\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and other actual and potential conflicts.\n\nThe global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict in Ukraine. Furthermore, governments in the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. The Company has no company-owned restaurants in Russia or Ukraine and has suspended corporate support for its master franchisee in Russia, which operates and supplies all 188 franchised Papa John’s restaurants there. The Company is unable to predict how long the current environment will last or if it will resume corporate support to impacted franchised restaurants. The Company also has franchise locations in Israel and a significant franchise presence in the Middle East. In connection with the ongoing conflict in Gaza, some of our franchisees in the Middle East have experienced boycotts resulting in decreased development prospects, sales and profitability. The Company is unable to predict how long the current environment will last or the long-term impact to these franchised locations.\n\nIn addition, our international business is subject to the risks of other geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including, for example, the ongoing conflicts described above and changes in China-Taiwan and United States-China relations. We have franchised restaurants located in China, South Korea, Israel and the Middle East. Although we do not do business in North Korea, any future increase in tensions between South Korea and North Korea, such as an outbreak or escalation of military hostilities, or between Taiwan and China could materially adversely affect our operations in Asia or the global economy, which in turn would adversely impact our business. Likewise, an escalation of the conflict in Gaza could materially adversely affect our operations in Israel, Jordan, Egypt and other countries in the Middle East.\n\nOur International operations are subject to increased risks and other factors that may make it more difficult to achieve or maintain profitability or meet planned growth rates.\n\nOur International operations could be negatively impacted by volatility and instability in international economic, political, security, or health conditions in the countries in which the Company or our franchisees operate, especially in emerging markets. In addition, there are risks associated with differing business and social cultures and consumer preferences. We may face limited availability for restaurant locations, higher location costs and difficulties in franchisee selection and financing. We may be subject to difficulties in sourcing and importing high-quality ingredients (and ensuring food safety) in a cost-effective manner, hiring and retaining qualified team members, marketing effectively and adequately investing in information technology, especially in emerging markets.\n\nOur International operations are also subject to additional risk factors, including import and export controls, compliance with anti-corruption and other foreign laws, difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contract rights in foreign jurisdictions, the imposition of increased or new tariffs or trade barriers and potential government seizures or nationalization. We intend to continue to expand internationally, which would make the risks related to our International operations more significant over time.\n\nOur International restaurants’ results, which are almost completely franchised, depend heavily on the operating capabilities and financial strength of our franchisees. Any changes in the ability of our franchisees to run their restaurants profitably in accordance with our operating standards, or to effectively sub-franchise restaurants, could result in brand damage, a higher number of restaurant closures and a reduction in the number of new restaurant openings (which could cause us to miss our net unit development targets). \n\nSales made by our franchisees in international markets and certain loans we provide to such franchisees are denominated in their local currencies, and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar occur relative to the local currencies. Accordingly, changes in currency exchange rates will cause our revenues, investment income and operating results to fluctuate. We have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Our International revenues and earnings may be adversely impacted as the U.S. dollar rises against foreign currencies because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Additionally, the value of certain assets or loans denominated in local currencies may deteriorate. Other items denominated in U.S. dollars, including product imports or loans, may also become more expensive, putting pressure on franchisees’ cash flows. Our International franchisees may also be impacted by currency restrictions imposed by governmental authorities, which could impact their ability to pay royalties in compliance with their franchise agreement. We have experienced situations with franchisees being subject to currency restrictions and unable pay royalties in U.S. dollars. \n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nWe are subject to risks related to epidemic and pandemic outbreaks, including COVID-19, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe remain subject to risks related to epidemic and pandemic outbreaks, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has had, and may continue to have, adverse impacts on economic and market conditions and our business. COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in the regions in which we operate. Certain parts of our operations may continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of COVID-19, including resurgences and variants of the virus. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the broader economy and how consumer behavior may change, and whether such change is temporary or permanent. To the extent that COVID-19 continues to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy, our business, financial conditions or results of operations, it may also heighten other risks described in this section.\n\nThe potential adverse effects of potential epidemics or outbreaks could also include, but may not be limited to, our ability to meet consumer demand through the continued availability of our workforce and our franchisees’ workforce; other changes in labor markets affecting us, our franchisees and suppliers, supply chain disruptions and increases in operating costs; adverse impacts from new laws and regulations affecting our business, increased cyber risks and reliance on technology infrastructure to support our business and operations, including through remote-work protocols, fluctuations in foreign currency markets, credit risks of our customers and counterparties, and impairment of long-lived assets, the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets. \n\nOur profitability may suffer as a result of intense competition in the QSR industry. \n\nThe QSR Pizza industry in the United States is mature and highly competitive. Competition is based on price, service, location, food quality, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, use of technology, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. We may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures, which may adversely affect our profitability. When commodity and other costs increase, we may be limited in our ability to increase prices. With the significant level of competition and the pace of innovation, we may be required to increase investment spending in several areas, particularly marketing and technology, which can decrease profitability. \n\nIn addition to competition with our larger competitors, we face competition from local quick service pizza delivery restaurants and new competitors such as fast casual pizza concepts. We also face competitive pressures from an array of food delivery concepts and aggregators delivering for quick service or dine in restaurants, using new delivery technologies or delivering for competitors who previously did not have delivery capabilities, some of which may have more effective marketing or delivery service capabilities. The emergence or growth of these competitors, in the pizza category or in the food service industry generally, may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our market share and could negatively impact our sales, profit margins, royalties, and our system-wide restaurant operations. We also face increasing competition from other home delivery services and grocery stores that offer an increasing variety of prepped or prepared meals in response to consumer demand. In addition, if our competitors respond more effectively to changes in consumer preferences or increase their market share, it could have a negative effect on our business. As a result, our sales can be directly and negatively impacted by actions of our competitors, the emergence or growth of new competitors, consumer sentiment or other factors outside our control.\n\nWe compete within the food service market and the QSR pizza market not only for customers, but also for management and hourly employees, including restaurant team members, drivers and qualified franchisees, as well as suitable real estate sites.\n\nOne of our competitive strengths is our “BETTER INGREDIENTS. BETTER PIZZA.®” brand promise. This means we may use ingredients that cost more than the ingredients some of our competitors may use. Because of our investment in higher-quality ingredients, we could have lower profit margins than some of our competitors if we are not able to establish a quality differentiator that resonates with consumers. Our sales may be particularly impacted as competitors increasingly emphasize lower-cost menu options.\n\nChanges in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could adversely impact our results. \n\nChanges in consumer preferences and trends could negatively affect us (for example, changes in consumer perceptions of certain ingredients that could cause consumers to avoid pizza or some of its ingredients in favor of foods that are or are perceived as healthier, lower-calorie, amenable to certain diets or lower in carbohydrates or otherwise based on their ingredients or nutritional content) or reduced consumption of pizza as a result of new weight loss drugs, such as GLP inhibitors and others. Preferences for a dining experience such as fast casual pizza concepts could also adversely affect our \n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nrestaurant business and reduce the effectiveness of our marketing and technology initiatives. Also, our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer income and spending, such as general economic conditions, customer sentiment and employment levels. Any factors that could cause consumers to spend less on food or shift to lower-priced products could reduce sales or inhibit our ability to maintain or increase pricing, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nFood safety and quality concerns may negatively impact our business and profitability. \n\nIncidents or reports of food- or water-borne illness or other food safety issues, investigations or other actions by food safety regulators, food contamination or tampering, employee hygiene and cleanliness failures, improper franchisee or employee conduct, or presence of communicable disease at our restaurants (both Company-owned and franchised), QC Centers, or suppliers could lead to product liability or other claims. If we were to experience any such incidents or reports, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted. This could result in a significant decrease in customer traffic and could negatively impact our revenues and profits. Similar incidents or reports occurring at quick service restaurants unrelated to us could likewise create negative publicity, which could negatively impact consumer behavior towards us.\n\nWe rely on our Domestic and International suppliers, as do our franchisees, to provide quality ingredients and to comply with applicable laws and industry standards. A failure of one of our Domestic or International suppliers to meet our quality standards, or comply with Domestic or International food industry standards, could result in a disruption in our supply chain and negatively impact our brand and our results.\n\nFailure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\nOur results depend upon our ability to differentiate our brand and our reputation for quality. Damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact our business and financial results. Our brand has been highly rated in past U.S. surveys, and we strive to build the value of our brand as we develop international markets. \n\nConsumer perceptions of our brand are affected by a variety of factors, such as the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the quality of the ingredients we use, our marketing and advertising, our corporate culture, our policies and systems related to DEI, our business practices, our engagement in local communities and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. \n\nConsumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by third parties, including current or former spokespersons, employees and executives, presenting or promoting adverse commentary or portrayals of our industry, our brand, our suppliers or our franchisees, or otherwise making statements, disclosing information or taking actions that could damage our reputation. If we are unsuccessful in managing incidents that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, our brand value and financial results could be negatively impacted. \n\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media, influencers, and/or shareholder activism could adversely impact our business.\n\nSocial media platforms, including blogs, chat platforms, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other persons. The popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination, and could hamper our ability to promptly correct misrepresentations or otherwise respond effectively to negative publicity, whether or not accurate. The dissemination of proprietary Company or negative information, whether or not accurate, by customers, employees, social media influencers, and others via social media could harm our business, brand, reputation, marketing partners, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information’s accuracy.\n\nIn addition, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers and the public in general. Failure to use social media effectively could negatively impact brand value and revenue. Other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our brand, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information. \n\nWe are also subject to the risk of negative publicity associated with various shareholder proposals, campaigns, and activism, including publicity related to the environment, animal welfare, diversity, responsible sourcing, and other Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) topics. Despite our best efforts relating to ESG policies, initiatives and reporting, media reports and social media campaigns can create a negative opinion or perception of the company’s efforts. \n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nSuch media reports and negative publicity could impact customer or investor perception of our Company or industry and can have a material adverse effect on our financial results. \n\nIn addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of our ESG initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting fail to meet investor, customer, consumer, employee or other stakeholders’ evolving expectations and standards, are incomplete or inaccurate, or certain groups or customers disagree with our ESG initiatives or goals, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our goals within the scope of ESG on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, brand, appeal to investors, employee retention, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.\n\nOur franchise business model presents a number of risks.\n\nOur success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence over their operations. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants and compliance with applicable laws. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to maintain or grow their sales. If our franchisees do not maintain or grow sales, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, especially in emerging markets and/or high-cost markets, their financial results may deteriorate, which in the past has resulted in, and could in the future result in, among other things, required financial support from us, higher numbers of restaurant closures (which could cause us to miss our net unit development targets), reduced numbers of restaurant openings, franchisee bankruptcies or restructuring activities, delayed or reduced payments to us, or increased franchisee assistance, which reduces our revenues.\n\nOur success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our franchisees to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and marketing plans. Franchisees’ ability to continue to grow is also dependent in large part on the availability of franchisee funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees. Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety, compliance, or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards or applicable laws, the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\n\nWe may be adversely impacted by increases in the cost of food ingredients and other costs.\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in prices of commodities and ingredients. An increase in the cost or sustained high levels of the cost of cheese or other commodities and ingredients could adversely affect the profitability of our system-wide restaurant operations, particularly if we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to offset increased costs. We have recently experienced significant inflation in commodities prices, including food ingredients, which has significantly increased our operating expenses. Cheese, representing our largest food cost, and other commodities and ingredients can be subject to significant cost fluctuations due to inflation, weather, availability, global demand and other factors that are beyond our control. Additionally, increases in labor, mileage, insurance, fuel, and other costs could adversely affect the profitability of our restaurant and QC Center businesses. Many of the factors affecting costs in our system-wide restaurant operations are beyond our control, and we may not be able to adequately mitigate these costs or pass along these costs to our customers or franchisees, given the significant competitive pricing pressures we face.\n\nChanges in privacy or data protection laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively. \n\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email, text messages, push notifications, social media and postal mailings. Any future restrictions in federal, state or foreign laws regarding marketing and solicitation or Domestic or International data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email, text messages, social media and postal mailing techniques and could force changes in our marketing strategies. If this occurs, we may need to develop alternative marketing strategies, which may not be as effective and could impact the amount and timing of our revenues.\n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nHigher labor costs, increased competition for qualified team members and ensuring adequate staffing in our restaurants and QC Centers increase the cost of doing business. Additionally, changes in employment and labor laws, including health care legislation and minimum wage increases, could increase costs for our system-wide operations. \n\nOur success depends in part on our and our franchisees’ ability to recruit, motivate, train and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. We and our franchisees have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for restaurant positions due to job market trends and conditions, which shortage has increased our and our franchisees’ labor expenses and could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions. Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in Company-owned and franchised restaurants have had, and may in the future have, a negative impact on our Company-owned restaurant margins and the margins of franchised restaurants. Competition for qualified drivers for both our restaurants and supply-chain function also continues to increase as more companies compete for drivers or enter the delivery space, including third party aggregators. Additionally, economic actions, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers. Social media may be used to foster negative perceptions of employment with our Company in particular or in our industry generally, and to promote strikes or boycotts.\n\nWe are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime compensation, benefits, working conditions, citizenship requirements and discrimination and family and medical leave and employee related litigation. Labor costs and labor-related benefits are primary components in the cost of operation of our restaurants and QC Centers. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could increase our system-wide labor costs.\n\nA significant number of hourly personnel are paid at rates at or above the federal and state minimum wage requirements. Accordingly, the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases above federal wage rates or regulations related to exempt employees has increased and could continue to increase labor costs for our Domestic system-wide operations. A significant increase in federal or state minimum wage requirement could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, and the viability of our franchisees restaurants in certain markets.\n\nAdditionally, while we do not currently have a unionized workforce, certain employees of other companies in our industry have recently become unionized. If a significant portion of our corporate or franchisee’s workforce were to become unionized, labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by union requirements that increase costs, disrupt business, reduce flexibility and affect the employer-employee relationship.Further, corporate or franchisees’ response to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived. We are also subject to potential joint-employer liability for issues that may occur with our franchise operations.\n\nOur business depends on the proper allocation of our human capital and our ability to attract and retain talented management and other key employees.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our allocation of our human capital will effectively meet the needs of our business and brands. Further, our business is based on our and our franchisees’ ability to successfully attract and retain talented employees. Competition for restaurant employees has increased as more companies compete for these employees as aggregator adoption and usage continues to increase requiring more labor. The market for highly skilled employees and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain management and other key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. The departure of a key executive or employee and/or the failure to ensure an effective transfer of knowledge and a smooth transition upon such departure may be disruptive to the business and could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\n\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to invest in or adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business. \n\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including digital ordering solutions, through which a majority of our Domestic sales originate. We also rely heavily on point-of-sale processing in our Company-owned and franchised restaurants for data collection and payment systems for the collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions, and other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends on the reliability and capacity of these technology systems. In addition, we anticipate that consumers will continue to have more options to place orders digitally, both domestically and internationally. We plan to continue to invest in enhancing and improving the functionality and features of our information technology systems. However, we cannot ensure that our initiatives will be beneficial to the extent, or within the timeframes, expected or that the estimated improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. Our \n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nfailure to adequately invest in new technology and adapt to technological developments and industry trends, particularly our digital ordering capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share. Notwithstanding adequate investment in new technology, our marketing and technology initiatives may not be successful in improving our comparable sales results. Additionally, we are in an environment where the technology life cycle is short and consumer technology demands are high, which requires continued reinvestment in technology that will increase the cost of doing business and will increase the risk that our technology may not be customer-centric or could become obsolete, inefficient or otherwise incompatible with other systems.\n\nWe rely on our International franchisees to maintain their own point-of-sale and online ordering systems, which are often purchased from third-party vendors, potentially exposing International franchisees to more operational risk, including cyber and data privacy risks and governmental regulation compliance risks.\n\nWe cannot predict the impact that new or improved technologies, alternative methods of delivery, including autonomous vehicle delivery, or changes in consumer or employee behavior facilitated by these technologies and alternative methods of delivery will have on our business.\n\nAdvances in technologies such as artificial intelligence or alternative methods of delivery, including advances in digital ordering technology and autonomous vehicle delivery, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery could have a negative effect on our business and market position. Moreover, technology and consumer offerings continue to develop, and we expect that new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future. We may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable customer proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model. However, we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our business. In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of alternative methods of delivery, which could harm our competitive position.\n\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences, including with respect to new technologies and alternative methods of delivery, or to effectively adjust our product mix, service offerings, and marketing and merchandising initiatives for products and services that address, and anticipate advances in, technology and market trends. Alternative methods of delivery may also impact the potential labor pool from which we recruit our delivery drivers and could reduce the available supply of labor.\n\nCompany Risks\n\nOur reorganization activities may increase our expenses, may not be successful, and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention.\n\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur certain non-recurring corporate reorganization costs, including the ongoing restructuring of our international business, and these expenses have impacted and could adversely impact our results of operations during the relevant period, reduce our cash position and/or result in an impairment risk related to these assets. Additionally, if we do not realize the anticipated benefits from these measures, or if we incur costs greater than anticipated, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nAs a result of any corporate reorganization, we could face turnover in our corporate offices and international support teams that could distract our employees, decrease employee morale, harm our reputation, and negatively impact the overall performance of our corporate support teams. These or other similar risks, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe may not be able to effectively market our products or maintain key marketing partnerships. \n\nThe success of our business depends on the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional plans. We may not be able to effectively execute our national or local marketing plans, particularly if we experienced lower sales that would result in reduced levels of marketing funds. In addition, our financial results may be harmed if our marketing, advertising, and promotional programs are less effective than those of our competitors, who may have greater resources which enable them to invest more than us in advertising. We may be required to expend additional funds to effectively improve consumer sentiment and sales, and we may also be required to engage in additional activities to retain customers or attract new customers to the brand. Such marketing expenses and promotional activities, which could include discounting our products, could adversely impact our results.\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nSpokespersons or marketing partners who endorse our products could take actions that harm their reputations, which could also cause harm to our brand. From time to time, in response to changes in the business environment and the audience share of marketing channels, we expect to reallocate marketing resources across social media and other channels. That reallocation may not be effective or as successful as the marketing and advertising allocations of our competitors, which could negatively impact the amount and timing of our revenues.\n\nWe may not be able to execute our strategy or achieve our planned growth targets, which could negatively impact our business and our financial results.\n\nOur growth strategy depends on our and our franchisees’ ability to open new restaurants and to operate them on a profitable basis. We expect substantially all of our International unit growth and much of our Domestic unit growth to be franchised units. Accordingly, our profitability increasingly depends upon royalty revenues from franchisees. If our franchisees are not able to operate their businesses successfully under our franchised business model, our results could suffer. Additionally, we may fail to attract new qualified franchisees or existing franchisees may close underperforming locations. Planned growth targets and the ability to operate new and existing restaurants profitably are affected by economic, regulatory and competitive conditions and consumer buying habits. A decrease in sales, or increased commodity or operating costs, including, but not limited to, employee compensation and benefits or insurance costs, could slow the rate of new restaurant openings or increase the number of restaurant closings. Our business is susceptible to adverse changes in local, national and global economic conditions, which could make it difficult for us to meet our growth targets. Additionally, we or our franchisees may face challenges securing financing, or securing financing on favorable terms, finding suitable restaurant locations at acceptable terms or securing required Domestic or foreign government permits and approvals. Declines in comparable sales, net restaurant openings and related operating profits can impact our stock price. If we do not continue to grow future sales and operating results and meet our related growth targets or external expectations for net restaurant openings or our other strategic objectives in the future, our stock price could decline.\n\nOur franchisees remain dependent on the availability of financing to remodel or renovate existing locations, upgrade systems and enhance technology, or construct and open new restaurants. From time to time, the Company may provide financing to certain franchisees and prospective franchisees in order to mitigate restaurant closings, allow new units to open, or complete required upgrades. If we are unable or unwilling to provide such financing, which is a function of, among other things, prevailing interest rates and a franchisee’s creditworthiness, the number of new restaurant openings may be lower or the rate of closures may be higher than expected and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. The elevated interest rate environment has increased the cost of this financing to franchisees, which may make the financing less appealing to franchisees and increase the risk of defaults. To the extent we provide financing to franchisees, our results could be negatively impacted by negative performance of these franchisee loans, including franchisees defaulting on payment terms or being unable to repay loans.\n\nOur dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers for some ingredients and other supplies could result in disruptions to our business. \n\nDomestic restaurants purchase substantially all food and related products from our QC Centers. We are dependent on Leprino Foods Dairy Products Company (“Leprino”) as our sole supplier for mozzarella cheese, one of our key ingredients. Leprino, one of the major pizza category suppliers of cheese in the United States, currently supplies all of our mozzarella cheese domestically and substantially all of our mozzarella cheese internationally. We also depend on a sole source for our supply of garlic sauce, which constitutes a small percentage of our purchased food items. While we have no other sole sources of supply for key ingredients or menu items, we do source other key ingredients from a limited number of suppliers. While we strive to engage in a competitive bidding process for our ingredients, because certain of these ingredients, including meat products, may only be available from a limited number of vendors, we may not always be able to do so effectively. We may be subject to interruptions in supply or shortages of these items due to factors beyond our control or issues with our suppliers from time to time. Alternative sources of mozzarella cheese and other key ingredients or menu items may not be available on a timely basis or may not be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current arrangements. \n\nIncrease in ingredient and other operating costs, including those caused by weather, climate change and food safety, could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOur Company-owned and franchised restaurants could also be harmed by supply chain interruptions including those caused by factors beyond our control or the control of our suppliers. Prolonged disruption in the supply of products from or to our QC Centers due to weather, climate change, natural disasters, public health crises, crop disease, food safety incidents, regulatory compliance, labor dispute or interruption of service by carriers could increase costs, limit the availability of \n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\ningredients critical to our restaurant operations and have a significant impact on results. Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in global weather patterns, including related to global climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients, energy and other materials throughout our supply chain. In particular, adverse weather or crop disease affecting the California tomato crop could disrupt the supply of pizza sauce to our and our franchisees’ restaurants. Insolvency of key suppliers could also cause similar business interruptions and negatively impact our business.\n\nWe rely on third parties for certain business processes and services, and failure or inability of such third-party vendors to perform subjects us to risks, including business disruption and increased costs. \n\nWe depend on the performance of suppliers, aggregators and other third parties in our business operations. Third-party business processes we utilize include information technology, gift card authorization and processing, other payment processing, benefits, and other accounting and business services. We conduct third-party due diligence and seek to obtain contractual assurance that our vendors will maintain adequate controls, such as adequate security against cybersecurity incidents. However, the failure of our suppliers to maintain adequate controls or comply with our expectations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nChanges in purchasing practices by our Domestic franchisees, or prolonged disruptions in our QC Center operations, could harm our commissary business.\n\nAlthough our Domestic franchisees currently purchase substantially all food products from our QC Centers, the only required QC Center purchases by franchisees are pizza sauce, dough and other items we may designate as proprietary or integral to our system. Any changes in purchasing practices by Domestic franchisees, such as seeking alternative approved suppliers of ingredients or other food products, could adversely affect the financial results of our QC Centers and the Company. In addition, any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our QC facilities, whether due to technical, systems, operational or labor difficulties, destruction or damage to the facility, real estate issues, limited capacity or other reasons, could adversely affect our business and operating results. As a result of our increasing the domestic supply chain operating margin, we could experience a decline in our domestic supply chain sales or our franchisees may choose to source non-core products from other suppliers, which would impact the profitability of our QC Centers.\n\nOur current insurance may not be adequate and we may experience claims in excess of our reserves.\n\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability, property, cyber insurance, and health insurance coverage provided to our employees are funded by the Company up to certain retention levels under our retention programs. Retention limits generally range up to $0.5 million with even higher retention limits for certain types of coverage. These insurance programs may not be adequate to protect us, and it may be difficult or impossible to obtain additional coverage or maintain current coverage at a reasonable cost. We also have experienced claims volatility and high costs for our insurance programs. We estimate loss reserves based on historical trends, actuarial assumptions and other data available to us, but we may not be able to accurately estimate reserves. If we experience claims in excess of our projections, our business could be negatively impacted. Our franchisees could be similarly impacted by higher claims experience, hurting both their operating results and/or limiting their ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost.\n\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\n\nWe have incurred substantial debt obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition, and we may incur more indebtedness, including secured debt, and take other actions that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness or affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\n\nOur outstanding debt as of December 31, 2023 was $764.0 million, which was comprised of $400.0 million outstanding under our 3.875% senior notes due 2029 (the “Notes”) and $364.0 million under our revolving credit facility (the “PJI Revolving Facility”) that forms part of our amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). We had approximately $236.0 million of remaining availability under the PJI Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2023. \n\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\n•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\n•increase our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate, regulatory and economic conditions;\n\n•expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under our Credit Agreement will be subject to variable rates of interest;\n\n•increase our vulnerability to a downgrade of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets;\n\n•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\n•limit our ability to borrow additional funds.\n\nWe expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations. Our ability to fund our expenses and to pay principal of and interest on our indebtedness when due thus depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors.\n\nIn addition, subject to restrictions in the agreements governing our existing and any future indebtedness, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, resulting in higher leverage. The Indenture and the Credit Agreement allow us to incur additional indebtedness, including secured debt. Such additional indebtedness may be substantial. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not prohibited by the Indenture or the Credit Agreement could have the effect of exacerbating the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness or diminishing our ability to make payments on our substantial indebtedness when due, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, other growth opportunities and other general corporate purposes. In addition, increasing or elevated prevailing interest rates will increase the costs of our indebtedness if we incur additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness at higher rates.\n\nThe agreements governing our debt, including the Indenture governing our Notes and the Credit Agreement, contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us. \n\nThe Indenture and the Credit Agreement impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. In particular, such agreements limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\n•incur additional indebtedness;\n\n•make certain investments;\n\n•sell assets, including capital stock of certain subsidiaries;\n\n•declare or pay dividends, repurchase or redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;\n\n•consolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve;\n\n•enter into transactions with our affiliates; and\n\n•incur liens.\n\nIn addition, our Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with specified leverage ratios under certain circumstances. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by our business performance or events beyond our control, and these provisions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise conduct our business activities and plans.\n\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities. \n\nFurthermore, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, and could increase the costs or availability of credit for us. Such a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nWe are exposed to variable interest rates under our Credit Agreement, and increases in interest rates would also increase our debt service costs and could have a material negative impact our profitability.\n\nWe are exposed to variable interest rates under the Credit Agreement. We have entered into interest rate swaps that fix a portion of our variable interest rate risk. However, by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we also expose ourselves to credit risk. Credit risk is due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.\n\nGeneral Risks\n\nNatural disasters, hostilities, social unrest, severe weather and other catastrophic events may disrupt our operations or supply chain. \n\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster, hostilities, cyber-attack, social unrest, terrorist activity, outbreak of an epidemic, a pandemic or other widespread health crisis, power outages, severe weather (such as tornados, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, heat waves, etc.) or other catastrophic events may disrupt our operations or supply chain and result in the closure of our restaurants (Company-owned or franchised), our corporate offices, any of our QC Centers or the facilities of our suppliers, and can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence levels and supply availability and costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nClimate change may have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nWe operate in 50 countries globally and recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, as we noted above, the supply and price of our food ingredients can be affected by multiple factors, such as weather and water supply quality and availability, which factors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change. While we believe our geographic diversity is likely to lessen the impact of individual climate-change related events on our financial results, our restaurants and operations may nonetheless be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires, floods and droughts. Such events have the potential to disrupt our and our franchisees’ operations, cause restaurant closures, disrupt the business of our third-party suppliers and impact our customers, all of which may cause us to suffer losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. \n\nIncreasingly complex laws and regulations could adversely affect our business. \n\nWe operate in an increasingly complex regulatory environment, and the cost of regulatory compliance is increasing. Our failure, or the failure of any of our franchisees, to comply with applicable U.S. and international labor, health care, food, health and safety, consumer protection, franchise, anti-bribery and corruption, competition, environmental, and other laws may result in civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties. Enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements, and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Increased regulatory scrutiny of food matters, online advertising, product marketing claims, mandatory fees, and increased litigation and enforcement actions may increase compliance and legal costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business. For example, some state and local governments have implemented laws and ordinances that restrict the sale of certain food and drink products, the type of packaging and utensils that may be used, or the manner in which mandatory fees are disclosed to consumers. \n\nCompliance with new or additional Domestic and International government data protection laws or regulations, including but not limited to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”), the UK GDPR and DPA 2018, as amended, the Canada Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“CTDPA”), the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), and several other data privacy and biometric laws passed or enacted by U.S. states, which could increase costs for compliance. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, it could damage our brand and subject the Company to reputational damage, significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in various jurisdictions. For example, a failure to comply with the EU GDPR could result in fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues. \n\nThere also has been increased stakeholder focus, including by US and foreign governmental authorities, investors, media and non-governmental organizations, on environmental sustainability matters, such as climate change, the reduction of \n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\ngreenhouse gases and water consumption. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in taxes, restrictions on or increases in the costs of supplies, transportation and utilities, any of which could increase our operating costs and those of our franchisees, and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish additional goals to take actions to meet them, which could expose us and our franchisees to market, operational, execution and reputational costs or risks. These initiatives or goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of any disclosure.\n\nIn addition to the changing rules and regulations related to ESG matters imposed by governmental and self-regulatory organizations such as the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, a variety of third-party organizations and institutional investors evaluate the stance and performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, including any changes to such initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. \n\nDisruptions to our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to compete and conduct our business.\n\nOur critical business and information technology systems have in the past and could in the future be damaged or interrupted by power loss, various technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks, ransomware sabotage or acts of God. In particular, the Company and our franchisees have experienced occasional interruptions of our digital ordering solutions, which make online ordering unavailable or slow to respond, negatively impacting sales and the experience of our customers. If our digital ordering solutions do not perform with adequate speed and security, our customers may be less inclined to use our digital ordering solutions. \n\nPart of our technology infrastructure, such as our Domestic point-of-sale system, is specifically designed for us and our operational systems, which could cause unexpected costs, delays or inefficiencies when infrastructure upgrades are needed or prolonged and widespread technological difficulties occur. Significant portions of our technology infrastructure, particularly in our digital ordering solutions, are provided by third parties, and the performance of these systems is largely beyond our control. Occasionally, we have experienced or could experience temporary disruptions in our business due to third-party systems failing to adequately perform. Failure to manage future failures of these systems, particularly as our online sales grow, could harm our business and the satisfaction of our customers. Such third-party systems could be disrupted either through system failure or if third party vendor patents and contractual agreements do not afford us protection against similar technology. In addition, we may not have or be able to obtain adequate protection or insurance to mitigate the risks of these events or compensate for losses related to these events, which could damage our business and reputation and be expensive and difficult to remedy or repair.\n\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in damage to our reputation, loss of sales, and/or subject us to litigation, penalties or significant costs. \n\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations. We collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card data and other personally identifiable information of our employees and customers housed in the various information systems we use. Constantly changing information security threats, particularly persistent cybersecurity threats, pose risks to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and the availability and integrity of our critical business functions. This could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or sensitive financial information. As techniques used in cyber-attacks evolve, including but not limited to the potential use of artificial intelligence in such attacks, we may not be able to timely detect threats or anticipate and implement adequate security measures. The integrity and protection of the customer, employee, franchisee and Company data are critical to us. Our information technology systems and databases, and those provided by our third-party vendors, including international vendors, have been and will continue to be subject to computer viruses, malware attacks, unauthorized user attempts, phishing and denial of service and other malicious cyber-attacks. We have instituted controls, including cybersecurity governance controls that are intended to protect our information systems, our point-of-sale systems, our information technology systems and networks, we adhere to payment card industry data security standards and we limit third party access for vendors that require access to our restaurant networks. However, we cannot control or prevent every cybersecurity risk. The failure to prevent fraud or security incidents or to adequately invest in data \n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nsecurity could harm our business and revenues due to the reputational damage to our brand. Such an incident could also result in litigation, regulatory actions or investigations, penalties, and other significant costs to us and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. These costs could be significant and well in excess of, or not covered by, our cyber insurance coverage. Significant costs could be required to investigate security incidents, remedy cybersecurity problems, recover lost data, prevent future incidents and adapt systems and practices to react to the changing cyber environment. These include costs associated with notifying affected individuals and other agencies, additional security technologies, training, personnel, and experts. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred, including by interfering with the pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives, and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems. Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party vendors can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and compromise information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time.\n\nWe have been and will continue to be subject to various types of investigations and litigation, including collective and class action litigation, which could subject us to significant damages or other remedies. \n\nWe are subject to the risk of investigations and litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, franchisees, state and federal agencies, stockholders and employees. From time to time, we are involved in a number of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings consisting of securities, antitrust, intellectual property, employment, consumer, data privacy, personal injury, corporate governance, commercial and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. \n\nWe have been subject to claims in cases containing collective and class action allegations. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. Litigation trends involving personal injury, employment law, intellectual property, data privacy, and the relationship between franchisors and franchisees may increase our cost of doing business. We evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the amount of potential losses to us. In many cases, particularly collective and class action cases, we may not be able to estimate the amount of potential losses and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient. These assessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of judgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact results of operations. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.\n\nWe may be subject to harassment or discrimination claims and legal proceedings. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct policies prohibit harassment and discrimination in the workplace, in any form. To monitor and enforce these policies, we have ongoing programs for workplace training and compliance, and we investigate and take disciplinary action with respect to alleged violations. Nevertheless, actions by our team members could violate those policies. Franchisees and suppliers are also required to comply with all applicable laws and govern themselves with integrity. Any violations (or perceived violations) by our franchisees or suppliers could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business and create reputational or other harm to the Company. \n\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could negatively affect our results of operations. \n\nWe depend on the Papa John’s brand name and rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property rights to protect and promote our brand. We believe the success of our business depends on our continued ability to exclusively use our existing marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand, both domestically and abroad. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and we may be required to pursue litigation to prevent consumer confusion and preserve our brand’s high-quality reputation. Litigation could result in high costs and diversion of resources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, regardless of the outcome.\n\nWe may be subject to impairment charges.\n\nImpairment charges are possible due to the nature and timing of decisions we make about underperforming assets or markets, or if previously opened or acquired restaurants perform below our expectations. This could result in a decrease in our reported asset value and reduction in our net income. \n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nWe operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results.\n\nWe operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. We have international operations and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions. The Domestic and International tax environments continue to evolve as a result of tax changes in various jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the tax laws in certain countries, including the United States, could impact our future operating results. A significant increase in the U.S. corporate tax rate could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity \n\nPapa Johns’ cybersecurity program includes a defense-in-depth model that utilizes a variety of techniques and tools for protecting against, detecting, responding to and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. Our cybersecurity program is designed to prioritize detection, analysis and response to known and anticipated cyber threats, effective management of cyber risks, and resilience against cybersecurity incidents. Our program leverages industry frameworks, including the Payment Card Industry Standards (PCI) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).\n\nCybersecurity Governance\n\nAt Papa Johns, the Company’s cybersecurity strategy and risk management is overseen by the Board of the Directors (the “Board”) through its Audit Committee and implemented and managed by the Company’s Cyber Oversight Group, a cross-functional team of senior management. \n\nBoard Governance\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Board consider cybersecurity part of the Company’s overall enterprise risk management (“ERM”) function, which the Audit Committee oversees. The Audit Committee and the Board consider cybersecurity as part of the Company’s business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation. \n\nThe Audit Committee oversees our information security program, which includes oversight of our cybersecurity program and cybersecurity risks. As part of its oversight responsibility, and pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee reviews with management and reports to the full Board with respect to significant information security matters and risks and management’s actions to monitor and address identified issues. The Internal Audit team meets monthly with the VP, Information Security and Compliance officer along with key IT leadership to discuss open cyber or data security risks. This effort is to ensure items of risk are addressed and resolved in a timely manner. The Audit Committee receives updates from the Company’s Chief Insights and Technology Officer (“CITO”), VP, Information Security and Compliance, and/or members of our executive leadership team. Management also reports to the full Board at least annually regarding a comprehensive overview and status of the Company’s information security program. The Audit Committee is also apprised of cybersecurity incidents consistent with the provisions of our cybersecurity incident response plan (“IRP”) pertaining to escalation of more significant incidents.\n\nManagement Governance\n\nThe controls and processes employed to assess, identify and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats are implemented and overseen by our Cyber Oversight Group, led by our CITO and VP, Information Security and Compliance. Our CITO leverages his decades of experience as an IT professional with significant expertise in enterprise architecture, engineering, analytics and digital technology. In addition, our VP, Information Security and Compliance has over 20 years of experience as a Chief Information Security Officer in multiple industries and has received Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) and Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) certifications. Our CITO and VP, Information Security and Compliance are responsible for the day-to-day management of the cybersecurity program, including the prevention, detection, investigation, and response to cybersecurity threats and incidents and are regularly engaged to help ensure the cybersecurity program functions effectively in the face of evolving cybersecurity threats.\n\nMembers of our Cyber Oversight Group also include our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Legal and Risk Officer, Senior Director of Internal Audit and technology and data privacy in-house counsel. The Cyber Oversight Group is also tasked with reporting to the Audit Committee on cybersecurity risk management strategies, as well as any significant \n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\ncybersecurity incidents that may occur. In addition, the Cyber Oversight Group meets at least four times per year, or with greater frequency as necessary, to, without limitation: \n\n•review with management the Company’s cybersecurity threat landscape, risks, and data security programs, and the Company’s management and mitigation of cybersecurity risks and incidents;\n\n•review with management the Company’s compliance with applicable information security and data protection laws and industry standards;\n\n•discuss with management the Company’s cybersecurity, technology and information systems policies as to risk assessment and risk management, including the guidelines and policies established by the Company to assess, monitor, and mitigate the Company’s significant cybersecurity, technology and information systems related risk exposures; and\n\n•review and provide oversight on the Company’s crisis preparedness with respect to cybersecurity, technology and information systems, including cybersecurity incident response preparedness, communication plans, and disaster recovery capabilities.\n\nProcesses for Assessing, Identifying and Managing Material Risks from Cybersecurity Threats\n\nOur Cyber Oversight Group utilizes the IRP to: (1) prepare for and protect against cybersecurity incidents; (2) identify and analyze cybersecurity incidents; and (3) contain, eradicate, and help ensure appropriate reporting of cybersecurity events. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, the IRP provides a framework to coordinate the response. The IRP also addresses escalation protocols to senior management responsibility with respect to disclosure determinations related to a cybersecurity incident and provides for Audit Committee and Board briefings as appropriate. We also manage threats to our systems originating or associated with third party service providers by integrating cybersecurity requirements and other provisions into various contracts. Vulnerabilities and risks identified for our third-party vendors are handled through ongoing scanning and reviews.\n\nWe employ a variety of measures to prepare for and protect against, detect, and contain and eradicate cybersecurity incidents and threats. The preparatory and protective measures we have in place include, without limitation, password protection, multi-factor authentication, internal and external penetration testing, cybersecurity assessments, industry benchmarking, and annual cybersecurity awareness trainings for our employees as well as social engineering awareness simulations. To detect and analyze cybersecurity incidents, our cybersecurity program uses automated event-detection technology monitored by our cyber defense team, notifications from employees, vendors or service providers, and other tools. Once a potential cybersecurity incident is detected, our IRP sets forth the process we follow to investigate the potential incident and contain it. After the cybersecurity incident is contained, our focus shifts to remediation, eradication, and recovery, with such efforts dependent upon on the nature of the cybersecurity incident. We have relationships with a number of well-established third-party service providers to assist with cybersecurity incident response, containment and remediation efforts. We also maintain cybersecurity insurance providing coverage for certain costs related to cybersecurity incidents that impact our own systems, networks, and technology. While we maintain a robust cybersecurity program, the techniques used to infiltrate information technology systems continue to evolve. Accordingly, we may not be able to timely detect threats or anticipate and implement adequate security measures. For additional information, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors.”\n\nCybersecurity Risks \n\nWe are currently not aware of any material cybersecurity incidents or threats that have impacted the Company or our business, financial condition, results of operations, employees or customers in the past three years. However, we and our customers routinely face risks of cybersecurity incidents, wholly or partially beyond our control, as we rely heavily on our information technology systems, including digital ordering solutions through which more than 85% of our domestic sales originate. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology systems, these systems and the proprietary, confidential internal and customer information that resides on or is transmitted through them, are subject to the risk of a cybersecurity incident or disruption, and there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures, and those of our third party providers, will prevent breakdowns or incidents affecting our or our third party providers’ databases or systems that could adversely affect our business. For a discussion of these risks, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Information Technology and Cybersecurity Risks—Disruptions of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to compete and conduct our business” and “—Failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in damage to our reputation, loss of sales, and/or subject us to litigation, penalties or significant costs.”\n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nItem 2.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nOur common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “PZZA.” As of February 22, 2024, there were 1,326 record holders of our common stock. However, there are significantly more beneficial owners of our common stock than there are record holders. \n\nOn January 30, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.46 per common share. The dividend was paid on February 23, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 12, 2024. \n\nWe anticipate continuing the payment of quarterly cash dividends. The actual amount of such dividends is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, results of operations, capital requirements, our financial condition, contractual restrictions, including the terms of the agreements governing our debt and any future indebtedness we may incur and other relevant factors. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at the current rate or at all.\n\nOn October 28, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with an indefinite duration for up to $425.0 million of the Company’s common stock. In fiscal 2023, approximately 2,523,000 shares with an aggregate cost of $209.6 million and an average price of $83.10 per share were repurchased under our share repurchase program. This includes the repurchase of approximately 2.2 million shares from certain funds affiliated with, or managed by, Starboard Value LP; refer to “Note 6. Stockholders’ Deficit” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional details. Funding for the share repurchase program was provided through our operating cash flows and cash provided from borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility (the “PJI Revolving Facility”). \n\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase activity by fiscal period during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nFiscal Period| TotalNumberof SharesPurchased| AveragePricePaid perShare| Total Numberof Shares Purchasedas Part of PubliclyAnnounced Plansor Programs| Maximum DollarValue of Sharesthat May Yet BePurchased Under thePlans or Programs  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n9/25/2023 - 10/22/2023| —| $| — | —| $| 90,160   \n10/23/2023 - 11/19/2023| —| — | —| 90,160   \n11/20/2023 - 12/31/2023| —| — | —| 90,160   \nTotal| —| $| — | —| $| 90,160   \n  \nWe did not repurchase any shares subsequent to year-end.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nIntroduction and Overview \n\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors. \n\nThis section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022. Discussion of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between the years ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022. \n\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December of each year. All fiscal years presented consist of 52 weeks except for the 2023 fiscal year, which consists of 53 weeks.\n\nPapa John’s International, Inc. (referred to as the “Company,” “Papa John’s,” “Papa Johns” or in the first-person notations of “we,” “us” and “our”) began operations in 1984. At December 31, 2023, there were 5,906 Papa John’s restaurants in operation, consisting of 648 Company-owned and 5,258 franchised restaurants. Our revenues are derived from retail sales of pizza and other food and beverage products to the general public by Company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties, and sales of franchise and development rights. Additionally, approximately 50% of our North America revenues in each of the last two fiscal years were derived from sales to franchisees of various items including food and paper products from our Domestic Quality Control Centers (“QC Centers”), operation of our International QC Center in the United Kingdom, contributions received by Papa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”) which is our national marketing fund, printing and promotional items and information systems equipment, and software and related services. We believe that in addition to supporting both Company and franchised profitability and growth, these activities contribute to product quality and consistency throughout the Papa John’s system. \n\nRecent Business Matters \n\nIn 2023, the Company focused on executing strategic priorities and building a foundation for long-term success, while navigating a dynamic macroeconomic environment. Our progress and significant transactions during the year are described below.\n\nGrowth Strategy. The Company delivered its eighteenth consecutive quarter of Global system-wide restaurant sales growth, fueled by continued product innovation and expansion both domestically and internationally. We launched the “Back to BETTER” initiative in late 2022, which focused on improving operational execution at the restaurant level in order to drive better financial performance. We have improved out-the-door times and overall customer satisfaction, and focused on increasing orders and optimization. Running BETTER operations is intended to increase customer and employee satisfaction, as well as drive customer loyalty. We are seeing improvement in our restaurant level operating margins, and we experienced a 3.4% increase in comparable sales for Domestic Company-owned restaurants for 2023. Focusing on future growth, we recently announced “Back to BETTER 2.0,” which is comprised of long-term strategic initiatives focused on driving systemwide sales through enhancing North America national marketing investment and effectiveness and accelerating North America development. In addition, we are evolving our Domestic Commissary business to provide cost savings for our franchisees and incremental profit for our business model. \n\n•Product innovation: Our menu and digital innovations are an important part of our long-term strategy to drive new customers and ticket sales. We focus our menu innovations on products that add both value and variety for our customers but do not add complexity to our restaurant operations or to our supply chain. Our menu innovation calendar is expansive, flexible and differentiated and allows us to adjust our offerings depending on what customers want – whether that is extending a Limited-Time-Offer or building upon existing platforms. We believe our digital innovations, like our website, digital app, third-party aggregator partnerships and Papa Call call centers are a differentiator for our customers and provide attractive channels that promote customer retention and help us grow our customer base. In 2023, approximately 85% of our Domestic transactions came through these digital channels. \n\n•Marketing strategy: We are activating a new marketing strategy in 2024. Based on a comprehensivereview of our creative and media strategy, we have identified opportunities to improve audience selection, offer differentiated category solutions, improve marketing return on ad spend, sustain loyalty and create cultural buzz. \n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nCorrespondingly, our franchisees have voted to increase the contribution rate to PJMF by 20%, or 100 basis points of sales. This change is intended to increase the productivity of franchisees’ marketing contributions by leveraging the scale that national investments deliver. At the same time, we have made local marketing optional for franchisees, resulting in a net decrease in required marketing spend and an opportunity to increase the overall profitability of restaurants. \n\n•Development strategy: Our expanding development pipeline is also a key long-term growth driver as we believe there is significant opportunity to offer our differentiated, premium position to more customers globally and domestically. In 2023, we expanded our global footprint by 3.7%, with 208 net new units comprised of 57 net unit openings in North America and 151 net unit openings in International markets. \n\nTo pursue the significant opportunities we have identified in the U.S. and accelerate development in 2024 and beyond, we have designed a new development incentive intended to deliver higher restaurant-level profit margins for new restaurants opened in 2024 through a waiver of PJMF contributions during the first five years of operations. We are also offering a three-year waiver of PJMF contributions for new restaurants opened in 2025. This new incentive is intended to improve profitability for franchisees, add scale in key markets and attract growth-driven franchisees. \n\nWe are pleased with the performance of our recently opened restaurants in North America and expect net new unit development for North America to increase by more than 20% in 2024 relative to 2023 net unit openings. From an International perspective, we are approaching 2024 with caution taking into account the ongoing dynamic geopolitical environment. In addition, this year we anticipate an increased number of strategic restaurant closures in certain markets which will likely have an impact on our ability to execute on our net new unit development goals in the near-term. In 2024, we expect gross openings of more than 100 new International restaurants. Additionally, we will evaluate making strategic restaurant closures in markets to improve marketplace health and exit unprofitable restaurants. As such, our anticipated gross openings could be offset by the closure of underperforming Company-owned and franchised restaurants to enhance long-term profitability. \n\n•Domestic commissary growth strategy: To drive profitable growth and overall supply chain productivity that provides cost savings and incremental profit for the system, we are evolving our commissary business. Beginning in 2024, we will increase the fixed operating margin that Domestic QC Centers charge by 100 basis points in each of the next four years, moving from 4% in 2023 to 8% in 2027. In total, this change should equate to approximately 100 basis points of cost at the restaurant level. To mitigate this cost for franchisees, we will offer new opportunities for franchisees to earn annual incentive-based rebates as they increase volume and open new restaurants. Franchisees who increase case-volume purchases at the highest volume growth could realize target market rates lower than the current 4% rate. Additionally, we expect the incremental volume driven by increased marketing and additional development will reduce the shared supply chain costs across the system. Lastly, we will be focused on driving continued productivity throughout the supply chain through improved operations and supplier relationships.\n\n•International strategy: In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company launched several initiatives as part of the International Transformation Plan described in Note 16. Restructuring of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” to evolve its international business structure, which resulted in charges of $2.2 million in the fourth quarter. These initiatives include the following:\n\n◦Establish International Regional Hubs – To deliver a frictionless, locally-valued offering with a recognizable and consistent customer experience, we are establishing hubs in our key regions – APAC (Asia Pacific), EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), and Latin America. These regional hubs will be led by experienced General Managers and their teams who will partner with franchisees to create a holistic strategy to boost performance in their markets. These teams will align global best practices in operations, marketing and technology with local preferences and needs to accomplish our long-term objective of increasing market share in key markets around the world. \n\n◦Increase Technology Investments – To further our ability to deliver impactful innovations, targeted marketing, and enhanced value in key international markets, we are increasing our investment in consumer-facing technology, digital infrastructure and enhanced reporting. By investing in expanded ordering capabilities through its website and app and leveraging analytics, we expect to improve purchase conversion, increase customer retention and deliver faster consumer insights to franchisees. \n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\n◦Optimize UK Business Model– Over the past two years, the Papa Johns restaurants in the UK have experienced declines in sales. As we have navigated a dynamic economic environment and worked towards repositioning the market, we established a Company-owned restaurant portfolio in the UK, acquiring 118 restaurants in the second and third quarters of 2023. These Company-owned restaurants incurred operating losses in 2023. In order to set up our largest international market for long-term success, we will continue to focus on driving profitability and strengthening our franchisee base within the UK. As a result, multiple low-performing franchised restaurants were closed in the fourth quarter of 2023. In February 2024, our Board of Directors approved the planned closure of approximately 50 underperforming Company-owned restaurants in the United Kingdom during the first six months of 2024. As a result of the planned closures, the Company expects to incur restructuring charges of approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million, which we expect will primarily be comprised of non-cash lease and fixed asset impairment charges and will be recognized during 2024 within our International segment. We are continuing to evaluate our restaurant portfolio in the UK, which may result in additional strategic restaurant closures or divestitures. Future closures would likely result in additional restructuring charges comprised primarily of lease, loan, and fixed asset impairment, though the amounts and nature of future expenses are currently not estimable as specific actions to effect those closures have not yet been determined. The Company currently expects any resulting restructuring costs to be recognized in 2024 and 2025. See Note “16. Restructuring” and Note “25. Subsequent Events”of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\n\nSignificant 2022 transactions\n\nRefranchising. In 2022, the Company sold its 51 percent controlling interest in a joint venture between Papa Johns and Blue and Silver Ventures, Ltd. (“Blue and Silver Ventures”). Sun Holdings, Inc. (“Sun Holdings”), a leading multi-brand franchisee operator and one of Papa John’s largest Domestic franchise partners, assumed control of the 90 Papa John’s restaurants in Texas that operated under the joint venture. By strategically refranchising its controlling interests in its joint venture with Blue and Silver Ventures to Sun Holdings, the Company provided Sun Holdings substantial scale to support new restaurant openings under its current, 100-restaurant development agreement with the Company. This commitment is in addition to the 90 refranchised restaurants. As a result, the deal is expected to accelerate the Company’s Domestic development, contributing to long-term earnings via high-margin franchise royalty growth. The restaurants were consolidated in the Company’s results through the date of the transaction, and their results are included in the Company’s North America franchise royalties and fees beginning March 29, 2022. See “Note 22. Divestitures” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information.\n\nSuspension of Franchisee Support in Russia. The Company has no Company-owned restaurants in Russia or Ukraine. At the end of fiscal year 2021, 188 franchised restaurants were located in Russia, all of which were operated and supplied through a master franchisee. As of March 2022, Papa John’s suspended its corporate operations and support for franchised restaurants in Russia, and fully reserved all receivables from the aforementioned master franchisee. The Company recognized $17.4 million in one-time, non-cash charges related to reserves for certain loans and impairments of reacquired franchised rights due to the conflict in Ukraine and subsequent international government actions and sanctions, which were recorded as Refranchising and impairment loss of $2.8 million and General and administrative expenses of $14.6 million. All assets related to the franchised operations in Russia have been fully reserved or impaired, so there are no additional Russia related charges for reserves, write-offs, or impairments of amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nPresentation of Financial Results\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A number of our significant accounting policies involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. On an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its estimates, including those related to insurance reserves, long-lived assets, the allowance for credit losses on franchisee notes receivable, and income taxes. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and significant changes in assumptions and/or conditions in our critical accounting policies could materially impact our operating results. The Company’s significant accounting policies, including recently issued accounting pronouncements, are more fully described in “Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”\n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nWe believe that our most critical accounting estimates are:\n\nInsurance Reserves\n\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability and property insurance coverage are funded by the Company up to certain retention levels. Retention limits range up to $0.5 million. We record the liability for losses based upon undiscounted estimates of the liability for claims incurred and for events that have occurred but have not been reported using certain third-party actuarial projections and our historical claims loss experience. \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our insurance reserves were $56.8 million compared to $67.3 million at December 25, 2022. Reserves are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our insurance reserves primarily relate to auto liability and workers’ compensation claims and include the gross up of claims above our retention levels, with a corresponding receivable recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The insurance reserves represent the mid-point of the range as determined by our actuarial analysis, which considered various actuarial valuation methodologies. The determination of the recorded insurance reserves is highly complex due to the significant uncertainty in the potential value of reported claims and the number and potential value of incurred but not reported claims. \n\nProperty and Equipment, Net and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nWe record property and equipment at its historical cost, which includes all costs necessarily incurred to bring the asset to the condition and location necessary for its intended use. Purchases of property and equipment were $76.6 million in 2023, $78.4 million in 2022, and $68.6 million in 2021. Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets provide a benefit to the Company. The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets as well as other information regarding condition and utility of the assets. Our asset useful lives are generally five to ten years for restaurant, commissary, and other equipment, twenty to forty years for buildings and improvements, and five years for technology, communication assets, and capitalized software. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the respective lease, including the first renewal period (generally five to ten years). Depreciation expense was $54.3 million in 2023, $45.6 million in 2022 and $43.0 million in 2021.\n\nWe evaluate property and equipment and other long-lived assets (primarily right-of-use operating lease assets) for potential indicators of impairment at least annually, or as facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We perform these assessments at the operating market level, as this represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If we determine there are indicators of impairment, we compare the net carrying value of the asset group to the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group exceeds the amount of estimated future undiscounted cash flows, then we estimate the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss if the carrying value exceeds fair value. If indicators of impairment are present, calculating projected undiscounted cash flows requires management to make assumptions and estimates for factors that include future comparable sales growth and gross margin based on internal projections as well as the historical performance of the market and whether that is an indicator of future performance. These assumptions for future growth are subjective and may be negatively impacted by future changes in operating performance or economic conditions. We did not record any impairment losses on property and equipment during 2023 or 2021, and recognized lease impairment charges of $0.9 million in 2022 related to the termination of a specific and significant franchisee in the UK.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Franchisee Notes Receivable\n\nThe Company has provided financing (recorded as notes receivable) to select Domestic and International franchisees principally for use in the construction and development of their restaurants and for the purchase of restaurants from the Company or other franchisees. Most notes receivable bear interest at fixed or floating rates and are generally secured by the assets of each restaurant and the ownership interests in the franchise. The Company has also provided long-term financing to certain franchisees with royalty payment plans.\n\nThe Company establishes an allowance for credit losses on franchisee notes receivables based on management’s estimate of the lifetime expected loss on the notes. The allowance for credit losses on notes receivable is judgmental and subjective based on management’s evaluation of historical collection experience and external market data and other factors, including those related to current market conditions and events. The Company is provided collateral rights of the franchisee’s restaurants (e.g., underlying franchise business, property and equipment) and personal guarantees from the operators to recover the carrying value of the outstanding note receivable in the event collectability concerns arise. Therefore, the \n\n36\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nCompany considers the fair value of the underlying collateral rights (e.g., underlying franchisee business, property and equipment) and any guarantees when assessing the allowance for credit losses (which may require third-party valuations of fair value). Notes receivable balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased. \n\nFranchisee notes receivable was $33.6 million with an allowance for credit losses of $16.1 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to $42.6 million with an allowance for credit losses of $14.5 million as of December 25, 2022. See “Note 10. Allowance for Credit Losses” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information.\n\nIncome Tax Accounts and Tax Reserves\n\nPapa John’s is subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining Papa John’s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable and those deferred. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax attribute carryforwards (e.g., net operating losses, capital losses, and foreign tax credits). The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the new tax rate is enacted. \n\nValuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to realize and were $37.6 million and $32.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is based on the evaluation of historical profitability, future market growth, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company assesses deferred taxes and the adequacy or need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.\n\nTax authorities periodically audit the Company. We record reserves and related interest and penalties for identified exposures as income tax expense. We evaluate these issues and adjust for events, such as statute of limitations expirations, court rulings or audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. \n\nIn the event the Company is unable to generate future taxable income, there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the tax laws change unfavorably, then we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate. We estimate that a one percent change in the effective income tax rate would impact the 2023 income tax expense by $1.0 million. See “Note 17. Income Taxes” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. \n\nGlobal Restaurant Sales and Unit Information\n\n“Comparable sales” represents the change in year-over-year sales for the same base of restaurants for the same fiscal periods. Comparable sales excludes sales of restaurants that were not open during both the current and prior fiscal periods and franchisees for which we suspended corporate support. “Global system-wide restaurant sales” represents total restaurant sales for all Company-owned and franchised restaurants open during the comparable periods, and “Global system-wide restaurant sales growth (decline)” represents the change in total system restaurant sales year-over-year. Global system-wide restaurant sales and global system-wide sales growth (decline) exclude franchisees for which we suspended corporate support. \n\n“Equivalent units” represents the number of restaurants open at the beginning of a given period, adjusted for restaurants opened, closed, acquired or sold during the period on a weighted average basis.\n\nWe believe North America, International and global restaurant and comparable sales growth (decline) and Global system-wide restaurant sales information is useful in analyzing our results since our franchisees pay royalties and marketing fund contributions that are based on a percentage of franchise sales. Comparable sales and Global system-wide restaurant sales results for restaurants operating outside of the United States are reported on a constant dollar basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. Franchise sales also generate commissary revenue in the United States and in certain international markets. Franchise restaurant and comparable sales growth information is also useful for comparison to industry trends and evaluating the strength of our brand. Management believes the presentation of franchise restaurant sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, provides investors with useful information regarding underlying sales \n\n37\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\ntrends and the impact of new unit growth without being impacted by swings in the external factor of foreign currency.

The UK franchisee acquisitions impact the composition of International revenues and the results of the International segment. Additionally, the 2022 refranchising resulted in 90 restaurants moving from Domestic Company-owned restaurants into North America franchising, effective as of the second quarter of 2022, impacting revenues for both of these segments. See “Note 24. Acquisitions” and “Note 22. Divestitures” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on these transactions.\n\nAdditionally, results for the year ended December 31, 2023 are not directly comparable with the results for the year ended December 25, 2022, as year-over-year comparisons are affected by an additional week of operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to the 53-week fiscal year in 2023. The estimated impact of the Company’s 53rd week on 2023 results has been highlighted in the discussion below to enhance comparability between the periods.\n\nTotal revenues increased $33.6 million, or 1.6% to $2.14 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year. Revenues for the 53rd week of operations in 2023 contributed approximately $41 million, or an increase of 1.9%. Other increases include a $31 million increase from our Domestic Company-owned restaurants, a $3 million increase in North America franchise royalties and a $24 million increase in International revenues primarily related to the UK franchisee acquisitions. These increases were offset by a $44 million decrease in North America commissary revenues reflecting lower commodity prices and transaction volume in 2023, a $3.4 million decrease primarily resulting from the sale of Preferred Marketing and a $17.8 million decrease resulting from the 2022 refranchising. \n\nDomestic Company-owned restaurant sales increased $18.0 million, or 2.5%for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. The benefit of the 53rd week of operations in 2023 was approximately $14 million, and 2022 included revenues of $27.3 million from the restaurants that were part of the 2022 refranchising. Excluding the impact of the 2022 refranchising and the additional week in 2023, Domestic Company-owned restaurant sales would have increased $31 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to increased comparable sales of 3.4% and equivalent unit growth of 1.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\nNorth America franchise royalties and fees increased $7.2 million, or 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. The benefit of the 53rd week of operations in 2023 was approximately $3 million. The 2023 increase resulting from the 2022 refranchising was $1.4 million. Excluding the 2022 refranchising and the additional week, North America franchise royalties and fees would have increased approximately $3 million, or 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to positive comparable sales of 0.1%, equivalent unit growth of 2.5% and fewer royalty waivers in 2023. \n\nNorth America franchise restaurant sales, excluding the impact of the 2022 refranchising, increased 3.4% to $3.09 billion ($3.03 billion on a 52-week basis) for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. North America franchise restaurant sales are not included in Company revenues; however, our North America franchise royalties are derived from these sales.\n\nNorth America commissary revenue decreased $17.3 million or 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. The benefit from the 53rd week of operations was approximately $19 million, or 2%.

Excluding the impact of the 2022 refranchising and the 53rd week, North America commissary revenue decreased approximately $44 million, or a decline of 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decline in North America commissary revenues was primarily a result of lower commodity prices, primarily poultry, cheese and wheat, in addition to lower volumes. \n\nInternational revenues increased $27.3 million, or 21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. The benefit of the 53rd week of operations in 2023 was approximately $4 million. The impact of the UK franchisee acquisitions was a net increase of approximately $20.3 million in 2023, representing sales attributable to the acquired UK franchisee restaurants less prior year franchise royalty and food distribution revenue generated from the UK formerly franchised restaurants. Excluding the impact of the UK franchisee acquisitions and the additional week, revenues would have increased approximately $3 million, or 2.9% primarily due to new unit development in 2023 and positive foreign currency fluctuations. These increases were partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 3.1% in International markets. \n\nInternational franchise restaurant sales increased $21.1 million to $1.19 billion ($1.16 billion on a 52-week basis) for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $1.17 billion for the prior year. Excluding the impact of the UK franchisee acquisitions, the previously disclosed franchisee suspended restaurants, and foreign currency fluctuations, International franchise restaurant sales increased $88.3 million or 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023. International franchise restaurant sales are not included in Company revenues; however, our International royalty revenue is derived from these sales.\n\nOther revenues, which primarily includes our national marketing fund, online and mobile ordering business and our previously wholly-owned print and promotions subsidiary, decreased $1.5 million, or 0.6% in 2023. The benefit of the 53rd week of operations was approximately $2 million, and the impact of the UK franchisee acquisitions decreased Other revenues by $3.2 million in 2023. Excluding the impact of the UK franchisee acquisitions and the additional week, Other revenues would have been flat as increased technology services from higher comparable sales and equivalent units were offset by the sale of our previously wholly-owned print and promotions subsidiary, Preferred Marketing, in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Adjusted operating income was $157.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $157.5 million for the prior year, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 0.3%. The 53rd week contributed approximately $8 million to operating income in 2023. The changes in adjusted operating income compared to the prior year were primarily due to the following: \n\n•Domestic Company-owned restaurants increased $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The 53rd week of operations contributed approximately $4 million to operating income in 2023. The impact of the 2022 refranchising decreased the segment’s operating income by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Excluding the impact of the additional week and the 2022 refranchising, Domestic Company-owned restaurants would have increased approximately $8 millionprimarily due to comparable sales growth of 3.4%, partially offset by higher benefits and utility expenses. \n\n•North America franchising increased $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The 53rd week of operations contributed approximately $3 million to operating income in 2023. The impact of the 2022 refranchising increased the segment’s operating income by $1.4 million in 2023. Excluding the impact of the additional week and the 2022 refranchising, the segment would have increased $2 millionprimarily due to an increase in comparable sales of 0.1%, higher equivalent units of 2.5% and fewer royalty waivers in 2023. \n\n•North America commissaries increased $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The 53rd week of operations contributed approximately $1 million to operating income in 2023. The impact of the 2022 refranchising decreased the segment’s operating income by $0.3 million in 2023. Excluding the additional week and the impact of the 2022 refranchising, operating income would have been down $1 million to 2022. \n\n•International decreased $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The 53rd week of operations contributed approximately $0.8 million to operating income during 2023. The impact of the UK franchisee acquisitions was a decrease of approximately $9 million in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by 2023 operating losses attributable to the recently acquired UK Company-owned restaurants that previously generated royalty \n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nincome in 2022. Excluding the additional week and the impact of the UK franchisee acquisitions, operating income would have increased $1.7 million primarily due to equivalent unit growth, partially offset by comparable sales declines of 3.1%. \n\n•All Others, which primarily includes our online and mobile ordering business and our marketing funds, were flat year over year.\n\n•Unallocated corporate expenses increased $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due higher incentive compensation and benefits costs, higher insurance costs and higher depreciation expense related to our investments in technology support initiatives and additional costs for our operators conference held in 2023.\n\nItems Below Operating Income\n\nThe following table sets forth the various items below Operating income from the Consolidated Statements of Operations:\n\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)| Year Ended  \n---|---  \nDecember 31, 2023| December 25, 2022| Change  \nOperating income| $| 147,142 | $| 109,030 | $| 38,112   \nNet interest expense| (43,469)| (25,261)| (18,208)  \nIncome before income taxes| 103,673 | 83,769 | 19,904   \nIncome tax expense| 20,874 | 14,420 | 6,454   \nNet income before attribution to noncontrolling interests| 82,799 | 69,349 | 13,450   \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests| (701)| (1,577)| 876   \nNet income attributable to the Company| $| 82,098 | $| 67,772 | $| 14,326   \nCalculation of net income for earnings per share:  \nNet income attributable to the Company| $| 82,098 | $| 67,772 | $| 14,326   \nDividends paid to participating securities| — | (306)| 306   \nNet income attributable to participating securities| — | (104)| 104   \nNet income attributable to common shareholders| $| 82,098 | $| 67,362 | $| 14,736   \n—   \nBasic earnings per common share| $| 2.49 | $| 1.90 | $| 0.59   \nDiluted earnings per common share| $| 2.48 | $| 1.89 | $| 0.59   \n  \nNet Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense increased approximately $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average outstanding debt on our senior secured revolving credit facility (the “PJI Revolving Facility”) as well as an increase in borrowing rates in 2023. The higher outstanding debt on our PJI Revolving Facility was primarily utilized to finance share repurchases in the first quarter of 2023. Total debt outstanding was $764.0 million and $605.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively.

Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, a non-GAAP measure, was $2.71 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $2.94 for the year ended December 25, 2022, representing a decrease of $0.23. See “Non-GAAP Measures” for additional information. These changes were driven by the same factors impacting operating income and adjusted operating income as discussed above. In addition, diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share reflect higher interest expense compared with 2022 due to higher borrowings used to fund share repurchases in the first quarter of 2023. \n\n45\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nNon-GAAP Measures \n\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP measures, which present results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the following: adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted earnings per common share. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they reflect metrics that our management team and Board of Directors utilize to evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and administer employee incentive plans. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted earnings per common share are operating income, net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share, respectively. These non-GAAP measures should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the Company’s performance than the Company’s U.S. GAAP results.

Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, and returning value to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases. Our capital priorities are:\n\n•investing for growth\n\n•maintaining a strong balance sheet, and\n\n•returning capital to shareholders\n\nThe Company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity, along with cash generated by operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements, cash dividends, interest payments and share repurchases over the next twelve months and beyond.\n\nCash Flows \n\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for each of the last two fiscal years (in thousands):\n\n2023| 2022  \n---|---  \nTotal cash provided by (used in):  \nOperating activities| $| 193,055 | $| 117,808   \nInvesting activities| (75,123)| (62,793)  \nFinancing activities| (124,076)| (76,240)  \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents| (642)| (2,012)  \nChange in cash and cash equivalents| $| (6,786)| $| (23,237)  \n  \nOperating Activities\n\nTotal cash provided by operating activities was $193.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $117.8 million for the prior year. The increase of $75.2 million primarily reflects higher net income in 2023 and favorable working capital changes. Favorable working capital changes were principally related to higher incentive compensation payments and deferred payroll tax payments related to the CARES Act made during the prior year, as well as current year increases in accounts payable due to extension of certain vendor terms within our North America commissary business and a reduction in inventory levels during 2023. These favorable changes were partially offset by the provision for allowance for credit losses of $20.5 million (See “Note 10. Allowance for Credit Losses” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”) and refranchising and impairment losses of $12.1 million (discussed above in “Results of Operations”) that were incurred during the prior year.\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nTotal cash used in investing activities was $75.1 million in 2023 compared to $62.8 million in 2022, an increase of $12.3 million. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash proceeds of $13.6 million, net of cash transferred, received from the 2022 refranchising during the year ended December 25, 2022, fewer note repayments during 2023, and payment of $5.6 million to purchase 37 International and Domestic restaurants during the year ended December 31, 2023. This activity was partially offset by a slight reduction in capital expenditures and fewer note issuances during 2023.\n\nFinancing Activities\n\nTotal cash used in financing activities was $124.1 million in 2023 compared to $76.2 million in 2022, an increase of $47.8 million. In 2023, cash used for financing activities includes outflows of $210.3 million in share repurchases and $58.5 million of dividends paid to common shareholders, partially offset by net borrowings of $159.0 million from the PJI Revolving Facility. In 2022, outflows included $125.0 million in share repurchases as well as dividends paid to common shareholders of $54.8 million, partially offset by $115.0 million in net borrowings from the PJI Revolving Facility.\n\n48\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nDebt\n\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company issued $400.0 million of 3.875% senior notes (the “Notes”) which will mature on September 15, 2029. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) replacing the Company’s previous credit agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for the PJI Revolving Facility, a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate available principal amount of $600.0 million, of which up to $40.0 million is available as swingline loans and up to $80.0 million is available as letters of credit. The PJI Revolving Facility will mature on September 14, 2026. \n\nOur outstanding debt as of December 31, 2023 was $764.0 million, which was comprised of $400.0 million outstanding under the Notes and $364.0 million outstanding under the PJI Revolving Facility. Remaining availability under the PJI Revolving Facility was $236.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, require customary reporting obligations, and restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, the consummation of certain mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and similar transactions, the making of investments, equity distributions and other restricted payments, and transactions with affiliates. The Company is also subject to certain financial covenants, as shown in the following table, that could restrict or impose constraints on the liquidity of our business:\n\nPermitted Ratio| Actual Ratio for theYear EndedDecember 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nLeverage ratio| Not to exceed 5.25 to 1.0| 3.2 to 1.0  \nInterest coverage ratio| Not less than 2.00 to 1.0| 3.3 to 1.0  \n  \nOur leverage ratio is defined as outstanding debt divided by Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), for the most recent four fiscal quarters. Our interest coverage ratio is defined as the sum of Consolidated EBITDA and consolidated rental expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters divided by the sum of consolidated interest expense and consolidated rental expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn addition, the Indenture governing the Notes contains customary covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock; prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; make loans and investments; sell assets; incur liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. \n\nPJMF, our national marketing fund, has a $30.0 million revolving line of credit (the “PJMF Revolving Facility”) pursuant to a Revolving Loan Agreement, dated September 30, 2015 with U.S. Bank National Association, as lender. On September 30, 2023, the Company amended the PJMF Revolving Facility to, among other items: (i) extend the maturity date to September 30, 2024; (ii) amend the variable interest rate to one-month SOFR plus 1.975%; and (iii) expand the capacity from $20.0 million to $30.0 million.\n\nThe PJMF Revolving Facility is secured by substantially all assets of PJMF. The PJMF Revolving Facility matures on September 30, 2024, but is subject to annual amendments. The borrowings under the PJMF Revolving Facility accrue interest at a variable rate of the one-month SOFR plus 1.975%. There was no debt outstanding under the PJMF Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2023 or December 25, 2022. The PJMF operating results and the related debt outstanding do not impact the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\n\nSee “Note 12.

On October 28, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with an indefinite duration for up to $425.0 million of the Company’s common stock. \n\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase activity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022:\n\n(In thousands, except average price per share)Year Ended| TotalNumberof SharesPurchased| AveragePricePaid per Share| AggregateCost ofSharesPurchased| Maximum DollarValue of Sharesthat May Yet BePurchased Under thePlans or Programs  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nDecember 31, 2023| 2,523| $| 83.10 | $| 209,640 | $| 90,160   \nDecember 25, 2022| 1,343| $| 93.07 | $| 125,000 | $| 299,800   \n  \nWe did not repurchase any shares subsequent to December 31, 2023. Approximately $90.2 million remained available under the Company’s share repurchase program as of February 22, 2024.\n\nThe Company utilizes a written trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, from time to time to facilitate the repurchase of shares of our common stock under this share repurchase program. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock either through a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or otherwise.\n\nDividends\n\nThe Company paid aggregate cash dividends to common stockholders of $58.5 million ($1.76 per share) and $54.8 million ($1.54 per share) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively.\n\nOn January 30, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.46 per common share, representing a $15.1 million aggregate dividend that was paid on February 23, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 12, 2024. The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows) less the purchases of property and equipment. We view free cash flow as an important financial measure because it is one factor that management uses in determining the amount of cash available for discretionary investment. Free cash flow is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our measure of free cash flow might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash flow should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the Company’s performance than the Company’s GAAP measures. \n\nThe Company’s free cash flow for the last two years was as follows (in thousands):\n\nYear Ended  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2023| December 25, 2022  \nNet cash provided by operating activities| $| 193,055| $| 117,808  \nPurchases of property and equipment| (76,620)| (78,391)  \nFree cash flow| $| 116,435| $| 39,417  \n  \nContractual Obligations\n\nThe Company’s cash requirements greater than twelve months from contractual obligations and commitments include: \n\n•Debt Obligations and Interest Payments: Refer to “Note 12.

This estimate includes development of Company-owned restaurants and technology enhancements. We intend to fund our capital expenditures with cash generated by operations and borrowings under the PJI Revolving Facility, as necessary.\n\nWe guarantee leases for certain Papa Johns North American franchisees who have purchased restaurants that were previously Company-owned. We are contingently liable on these leases. The leases have varying terms, the latest of which expires in 2036. As of December 31, 2023, the estimated maximum amount of undiscounted payments the Company could be required to make in the event of nonpayment by the primary lessees was approximately $7.3 million. \n\nWe have certain other commercial commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. With our insurance programs, we are party to surety bonds with off-balance sheet risk for a total of $20.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses. See “Note 12. Debt” and “Note 19. Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to contractual and other commitments.\n\nImpact of Inflation\n\nWe experienced price increases in food items and other commodities, labor and benefits, and fuel and other energy costs during 2022, which began to gradually ease throughout 2023 and which we expect to continue to moderate during 2024. Inflationary pressures affect our profitability both directly, in our company-owned restaurants and delivery mechanisms and through gross margins experienced by sales of food and supply items via our QC Centers, as well as indirectly, through higher food ingredient and paper and supply costs, rising fees from delivery aggregators driven by higher wage demands and increases in the cost of gasoline that, once reflected in upward price adjustments on their fees, can exert downward pressure on unit sales, reducing royalty fees we realize from our Domestic and International franchisees. Compensating menu price increases are subject to competitive pressure in the markets in which we operate. Expense control measures are also deployed to offset higher costs when possible. Food costs, in particular the cost of cheese, are managed to an extent by pricing agreements with suppliers and forward purchase contracts we enter into, as discussed in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain matters discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other Company communications that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Generally, the use of words such as “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “will,” “forecast,” “outlook”, “plan,” “project,” or similar words identify forward-looking statements that we intend to be included within the safe harbor protections provided by the federal securities laws.

\n\n•increases in insurance claims and related costs for programs funded by the Company up to certain retention limits, including medical, owned and non-owned vehicles, workers’ compensation, general liability and property; \n\n•disruption of our supply chain or commissary operations which could be caused by our sole source of supply of mozzarella cheese, desserts, garlic cups or limited source of suppliers for other key ingredients or more generally due to weather, natural disasters including drought, disease, or geopolitical or other disruptions beyond our control; \n\n•increased risks associated with our International operations, including economic and political conditions and risks associated with the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, instability or uncertainty in our international markets, especially emerging markets, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulty in meeting planned sales targets and new restaurant growth;\n\n•the impact of current or future claims and litigation and our ability to comply with current, proposed or future legislation that could impact our business including compliance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation;

Item 1A. — Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and they may be updated from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nWe are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on our PJI Revolving Facility. We attempt to minimize interest rate risk exposure by fixing our interest rate through the utilization of interest rate swaps, which are derivative financial instruments. Our swaps are entered into with financial institutions that participate in the PJI Revolving Facility. By using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we expose ourselves to credit risk due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We do not enter into contracts for trading \n\n52\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\npurposes and do not use leveraged instruments. See “Note 12. Debt” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our debt obligations and derivative instruments.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk \n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from our operations outside of the United States, which can adversely impact our revenues, net income and cash flows. Our International operations principally consist of distribution sales to franchised Papa John’s restaurants located in the UK, operation of Company-owned restaurants in the UK, and our franchise sales and support activities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our International franchisees. Approximately 7.4% of our 2023 revenues, 6.2% of our 2022 revenues and 7.3% of our 2021 revenues were derived from these International operations.\n\nWe have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of approximately $1.7 million on our total revenues in 2023, compared to an unfavorable impact of approximately $13.3 million in 2022 and a favorable impact of approximately $8.1 million in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.9 million on our operating income in 2023 compared to an unfavorable impact of $2.0 million in 2022 and a favorable impact of $1.4 million in 2021. A 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our International markets would result in a negative impact on annual revenue and operating income of approximately $14.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, based on annual revenue and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\nCommodity Price Risk\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the food and paper products we purchase, including cheese (our largest ingredient cost), are subject to seasonal fluctuations, weather, availability, demand and other factors that are beyond our control. We have pricing agreements with some of our vendors, including forward pricing agreements for a portion of our cheese purchases for our Domestic Company-owned restaurants, which are accounted for as normal purchases; however, we still remain exposed to ongoing commodity volatility, and increases in commodity prices or food costs, including as a result of inflation, could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have not historically entered into other financial instruments that would be accounted for as hedging instruments to manage this risk.\n\n53\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 29, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\n55\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nMeasurement and valuation of insurance reserves  \n---  \nDescription of the Matter| As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is self-insured for certain obligations up to stated retention levels under its retention programs related to workers’ compensation, automobile, property and general liability programs. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has $56.8 million accrued for self-insurance reserves (“Insurance Reserves”). Judgments and estimates are used by the Company in determining the potential value associated with incurred but not reported claims.Auditing the measurement and valuation of the Insurance Reserves is highly judgmental and complex due to the significant uncertainty in estimating the potential value of reported claims, estimating the number and potential value of incurred but not reported claims and the use of actuarial valuation methods. The reserve estimate is sensitive to actuarial assumptions (e.g., future emergence of losses, incurred but not reported claims) used to estimate the ultimate liability for reported claims and claims that have been incurred but have not been reported.   \nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit| We tested controls related to the measurement and valuation of the Insurance Reserves. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the assumptions and methods used to establish the estimate, the underlying data, significant actuarial assumptions and the related reconciliations.To test the measurement and valuation of the Insurance Reserves, our audit procedures included, among others, performing transactional tests of details over the completeness and accuracy of claims data and vouching payments made to third parties. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in the evaluation of the key assumptions and methodologies used by management to determine the Insurance Reserves.  \n  \n/s/ Ernst & Young

Description of Business\n\nPapa John’s International, Inc. (referred to as the “Company,” “Papa John’s,” “Papa Johns” or in the first person notations of “we,” “us” and “our”), operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants under the trademark “Papa Johns,” in 50countries and territories as of December 31, 2023. Our revenues are derived from retail sales of pizza and other food and beverage products to the general public by Company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties and sales of franchise and development rights, printing and promotional items and information systems equipment, and software and related services. We generate revenues from the operation of our Quality Control Centers (“QC Centers”) which supply pizza sauce, dough, food products, paper products, smallwares and cleaning supplies to restaurants. We also derive revenue from contributions received into our national marketing fund.\n\nIn discussions of our business, “Domestic” is defined as within the contiguous United States, “North America” includes Canada, and “International” includes the rest of the world other than North America.\n\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Papa John’s International, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nVariable Interest Entity\n\nPapa John’s Domestic restaurants, both Company-owned and franchised, participate in Papa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”), a nonstock corporation designed to operate at break-even as it spends all annual contributions received from the system. PJMF collects a percentage of revenues from Company-owned and franchised restaurants in the United States for the purpose of designing and administering advertising and promotional programs. PJMF is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) that funds its operations with ongoing financial support and contributions from the Domestic restaurants, of which approximately 85 percent are franchised, and does not have sufficient equity to fund its operations without these ongoing financial contributions. Based on an assessment of the governance structure and operating procedures of PJMF, the Company determined it has the power to control certain significant activities of PJMF, and therefore, is the primary beneficiary. The Company has consolidated PJMF in its financial results in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, “Consolidation.”\n\nFiscal Year\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December of each year. All fiscal years presented consist of 52 weeks except for the 2023 fiscal year, which consists of 53 weeks.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include the allowance for credit losses on accounts and notes receivable, intangible assets, contract assets and contract liabilities including the customer loyalty program obligation, property and equipment, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, gift card breakage, insurance reserves and tax reserves. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could significantly differ from these estimates.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in contracts with customers and excludes waivers or incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties, primarily sales tax. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the \n\n64\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nCompany from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Delivery costs, including freight associated with our Domestic commissary and other sales, are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in operating costs. \n\nThe following describes principal activities, separated by major product or service, from which the Company generates its revenues: \n\nDomestic Company-owned Restaurant Sales \n\nThe Domestic Company-owned restaurants principally generates revenues from retail sales of pizza, Papadias, and side items, including breadsticks, Papa Bites, cheesesticks, boneless chicken wings and bone-in chicken wings, dessert items and canned or bottled beverages. Revenues from Company-owned restaurants are recognized when the products are delivered to or carried out by customers. \n\nOur North American customer loyalty program, Papa Rewards, is a spend-based program that rewards customers with points for each purchase. Papa Rewards points are accumulated and redeemed for dollar off discounts (“Papa Dough”), and points expire after a year of inactivity. Once points are redeemed, Papa Dough may be used on future purchases within a six-month expiration window. The accrued liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and corresponding reduction of Company-owned restaurant sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, is for the estimated reward redemptions at Domestic Company-owned restaurants based upon estimated redemption patterns. The liability related to Papa Rewards is calculated using the estimated redemption value for which the points and accumulated rewards are expected to be redeemed. Revenue is recognized when the customer redeems the Papa Dough reward and when the points or Papa Dough reward expires. \n\nFranchise Royalties and Fees\n\nFranchise royalties, which are based on a percentage of franchise restaurant sales, are recognized as sales occur. Incentives offered from time to time, including new restaurant incentives, will reduce the contractual royalty rate paid. Any royalty reductions, including waivers or those offered as part of a new restaurant development incentive or as incentive for other behaviors, including acceleration of restaurant remodels or equipment upgrades, are recognized at the same time as the related royalty, as they are not separately distinguishable from the full royalty rate. Our current standard franchise agreement requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 5% of sales, and the majority of our existing franchised restaurants have a 5% contractual royalty rate in effect. Franchise royalties are billed on a monthly basis. \n\nThe majority of initial franchise license fees and area development exclusivity fees are from International locations. Initial franchise license fees are billed at the restaurant opening date. The pre-opening services provided to franchisees do not contain separate and distinct performance obligations from the franchise right; thus, the fees collected will be deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis beginning at the restaurant opening date through the term of the franchise agreement, which is typically 10 years. Franchise license renewal fees for both Domestic and International locations, which generally occur every 10 years, are billed before the renewal date. Fees received for future license renewal periods are deferred and amortized over the life of the renewal period. Area development exclusivity fees are billed upon execution of the development agreements which grant the right to develop franchised restaurants in future periods in specific geographic areas. Area development exclusivity fees are allocated on a pro rata basis to all restaurants opened under that specific development agreement. These fees are deferred and amortized over the term of the related franchise agreements, which is typically 10 years. \n\nCommissary Revenues\n\nCommissary revenues are comprised of food and supplies sold to franchised restaurants and are recognized as revenue upon shipment of the related products to the franchisees. Payments are generally due within 30 days. \n\nThere are various incentive programs available to franchisees related to new restaurant openings including discounts on initial commissary orders and new restaurant equipment incentives, at substantially no cost to franchisees. Commissary revenues are reduced to reflect incentives in the form of direct discounts on initial commissary orders. The new restaurant equipment incentive is also recorded as a reduction of commissary sales over the term of the incentive agreement, which is generally three to five years.\n\nOther Revenues\n\nFranchise Marketing Fund revenues represent a required established percentage of monthly restaurant sales collected by PJMF, which is our national marketing fund, and various other international and Domestic marketing funds (“Co-op” or \n\n65\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\n“Co-operative” Funds) where we have determined for purposes of accounting that we have control over the significant activities of the funds. PJMF funds its operations with ongoing financial support and contributions from Domestic Papa John’s restaurants, of which approximately 85% are franchised restaurant members. Contributions are based on a percentage of monthly restaurant sales and are billed monthly. When we are determined to be the principal in these arrangements, advertising fund contributions and expenditures are reported on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our obligation related to these funds is to develop and conduct advertising activities in a specific country, region, or market, including the placement of electronic and print materials.\n\nThere are no expiration dates and we do not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift cards. While the Company and the franchisees continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, the likelihood of redemption may be determined to be remote for certain cards due to long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, the Company recognizes breakage revenue for amounts not subject to unclaimed property laws. Based upon our analysis of historical gift card redemption patterns, we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote. Breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to estimated redemption patterns as Other revenues. Commissions on gift cards sold by third parties are recorded as a reduction to Deferred revenue and a reduction to Other revenues based upon estimated redemption patterns.\n\nFees for information services, including software maintenance fees, help desk fees, centralized call center fees, and online ordering fees are recognized as revenue as such services are provided and are included in Other revenues.\n\nRental income, primarily derived from properties leased by the Company and subleased to franchisees in the UK, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective operating lease terms.\n\nAdvertising and Related Costs\n\nDomestic Company-owned advertising and related costs of $53.9 million, $55.2 million and $61.7 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, include the costs of Domestic Company-owned local restaurant activities such as mail coupons, door hangers and promotional items and advertising activities administered through PJMF and various local market cooperative advertising funds. PJMF is responsible for developing and conducting marketing and advertising for the Domestic Papa John’s system. The Co-op Funds are responsible for developing and conducting advertising activities in a specific market, including the placement of electronic and print materials developed by PJMF. The marketing fund investments are included in General and administrative expenses within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and are accrued and expensed when the franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as PJMF is designed to operate at break-even.\n\nLeases\n\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease term for operating leases, whereas lease expense follows an accelerated expense recognition for finance leases. A lease term often includes option periods, available at the inception of the lease. Lease expense is comprised of operating and finance lease costs, short-term lease costs, and variable lease costs, which primarily include common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and insurance for the Company’s real estate leases. Lease costs also include variable rent, which is primarily related to the Company’s supply chain tractor and trailer leases that are based on a rate per mile.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nCompensation expense for equity grants is estimated on the grant date, net of projected forfeitures, and is recognized over the vesting period (graded vesting over three years). We have elected a policy to estimate forfeitures in determining the amount of stock-based employee compensation expense. Restricted stock is valued based on the market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. Management evaluates its award grants and modifications and will adjust the fair value if any are determined to be spring-loaded.\n\nCash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less at date of purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\n66\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nSubstantially all accounts receivable is due from franchisees for purchases of food, paper products, point of sale equipment, information systems and related services, marketing and royalties. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the franchisee’s financial condition and collateral is generally not required. An allowance for credit losses is an estimate, even if remote, based upon historical account write-off trends, facts about the current financial condition of the debtor, forecasts of future operating results based upon current trends of select operating metrics and macroeconomic factors. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased.\n\nNotes Receivable \n\nThe Company has provided financing to select Domestic and International franchisees principally for use in the construction and development of their restaurants and for the purchase of restaurants from the Company or other franchisees. Most notes receivable bear interest at fixed or floating rates and are generally secured by the assets of each restaurant and the ownership interests in the franchise. The Company has provided long-term financing to certain franchisees with royalty payment plans. We establish an allowance for credit losses for franchisee notes receivables to reduce the outstanding notes receivable to their net realizable values based on a review of each franchisee’s economic performance and market conditions after consideration of the fair value of our underlying collateral rights (e.g., underlying franchisee business, property and equipment) and any guarantees. Note balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased. \n\nInterest income recorded on franchisee loans was approximately $1.1 million in 2023, $1.3 million in 2022 and $1.9 million in 2021 and is reported in Net interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nInventories\n\nInventories, which consist of food products, paper goods, supplies and smallwares are stated at the lower of cost, determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally five to ten years for restaurant, commissary and other equipment, twenty to forty years for buildings and improvements, and five years for technology and communication assets). Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including the first renewal period (generally five to ten years).\n\nDepreciation expense was $54.3 million in 2023, $45.6 million in 2022 and $43.0 million in 2021.\n\nDeferred Costs\n\nWe capitalize certain information systems development and related costs that meet established criteria. Amounts capitalized, which are included in property and equipment, are amortized principally over periods not exceeding five years upon completion of the related information systems project. Total costs capitalized were approximately $4.1 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021. The unamortized information systems development costs approximated $9.9 million and $9.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively.\n\nIntangible Assets — Goodwill\n\nWe evaluate goodwill annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever we identify certain triggering events or circumstances that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of our reporting units, which includes our Domestic Company-owned restaurants, United Kingdom (“PJUK”), China, and Preferred Marketing Solutions operations, which were sold on October 22, 2023. We may perform a qualitative assessment or move directly to the quantitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period if we believe that it is more efficient or if impairment indicators exist.\n\nWe elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our Domestic Company-owned restaurants, PJUK, and China as of the first day of the fourth quarter of 2023; we excluded the goodwill associated with our Preferred Marketing Solutions reporting unit, as the business was sold shortly after the date of our assessment and the balance was not material to the consolidated financial statements. As a result of our qualitative analysis, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not \n\n67\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nthat the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts. Subsequent to completing our goodwill impairment tests, no indicators of impairment were identified. See “Note 11. Goodwill” for additional information.\n\nDeferred Income Tax Accounts and Tax Reserves\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable and those deferred. \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted by tax jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax attribute carryforwards (e.g., net operating losses, capital losses, and foreign tax credits). The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the new tax rate is enacted. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to realize.\n\nTax authorities periodically audit the Company. We record reserves and related interest and penalties for identified exposures as income tax expense. We evaluate these issues and adjust for events, such as statute of limitations expirations, court rulings or audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. See “Note 17. Income Taxes” for additional information.\n\nInsurance Reserves\n\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability and property insurance coverage provided to our employees are funded by the Company up to certain retention limits which range up to $0.5 million.\n\nLosses are accrued based upon undiscounted estimates of the liability for claims incurred and for events that have occurred but have not been reported using certain third-party actuarial projections and our claims loss experience. The determination of the recorded insurance reserves is highly judgmental and complex due to the significant uncertainty in the potential value of reported claims and the number and potential value of incurred but not reported claims, the application of significant judgment in making those estimates and the use of various actuarial valuation methods. The estimated insurance claims losses could be significantly affected should the frequency or ultimate cost of claims differ significantly from historical trends used to estimate the insurance reserves recorded by the Company. The Company records estimated losses above retention within its reserve with a corresponding receivable for expected amounts due from insurance carriers. \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our insurance reserve was $56.8 million as compared to $67.3 million as of December 25, 2022 and was primarily related to auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. Of these amounts, approximately $27.2 million and $29.7 million were recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $29.5 million and $37.6 million were recorded in Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively. Our reserves include claim costs above our retention that have a corresponding receivable. Our insurance receivable for claims above retention totaled $34.5 million and $38.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately $16.8 million and $17.0 million were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, and $17.8 million and $21.4 million were recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nWe recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. At inception and on an ongoing basis, we assess whether each derivative that qualifies for hedge accounting continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. If the derivative meets the hedge criteria as defined by certain accounting standards, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.

As further described in “Note 22. Divestitures,” the Company divested its 51 percent interest in one joint venture that owned 90 restaurants in the second quarter of 2022. Consolidated net income is required to be reported separately at amounts attributable to both the Company and the noncontrolling interests held by third parties. Additionally, disclosures are required to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the Company and the interests of the noncontrolling owners, including a disclosure on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations of income attributable to the noncontrolling interest holder.\n\nThe following summarizes the redemption feature, location and related accounting within the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these joint venture arrangements:\n\nType of Joint Venture Arrangement| Location within the Consolidated Balance Sheets| Recorded Value  \n---|---|---  \nJoint ventures with no redemption feature| Permanent equity| Carrying value  \nJoint venture with option to require the Company to purchase the noncontrolling interest - not currently redeemable or redemption not probable| Temporary equity| Carrying value  \n  \nSee “Note 9. Noncontrolling Interests”for additional information regarding noncontrolling interests.\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\nThe local currency is the functional currency for each of our foreign subsidiaries. Revenues and expenses are translated into United States (“U.S.”) dollars using monthly average exchange rates, while assets and liabilities are translated using year-end exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of AOCL, net of income taxes. Foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses are included in determining net income.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSegment Disclosures\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The ASU expands the scope and frequency of segment disclosures and introduces the concept of a “significant expense principle,” which requires entities to disclose significant expense categories and amounts that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within the reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. The ASU also changes current disclosure requirements by allowing entities to report multiple measures of a segment’s profit or loss, provided the reported measures are used by the CODM to assess performance and allocate resources and that the measure closest to GAAP is also provided. Finally, the ASU requires all segment profit or loss and assets disclosures to be provided on both an annual and interim basis and requires entities to disclose the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and shall be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the standard and determining the extent of additional interim and annual segment disclosures that will be required.\n\nIncome Tax Disclosures\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” The ASU provides for additional levels of details within the required rate reconciliation table to include additional categories of information about federal, state, and foreign income taxes and requires entities to further disaggregate information about income taxes paid, net of refunds. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and shall be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the standard and determining the extent of additional disclosures that will be required.\n\n3. Leases\n\nThe Company has significant leases that include most Domestic Company-owned restaurant and commissary locations as well as our corporate office located in Atlanta, Georgia. Other Domestic leases include tractor and trailer leases used by our distribution subsidiary as well as commissary equipment.

The Company’s leases have terms as follows:\n\nAverage lease term  \n---  \nDomestic Company-owned restaurants| Five years, plus at least one renewal  \nUK Company-owned and franchise-owned restaurants| 15 years  \nDomestic commissary locations| 10 years, plus at least one renewal  \nDomestic and International tractors and trailers| Five to seven years  \nDomestic and International commissary and office equipment| Three to five years  \n  \nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception and recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. For all of its leases in which it is a lessee, the Company has elected to include both the lease and non-lease components as a single component and account for it as a lease. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less but greater than one month are not recorded on the balance sheet for select asset classes. The lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments as of the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset recognized is based on the lease liability adjusted for prepaid and deferred rent and unamortized lease incentives. An operating lease right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recognized as a single lease cost against the operating lease liability. A finance lease right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis, with interest costs reported separately, over the lesser of the useful life of the leased asset or lease term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in Operating costs or General and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe Company uses its incremental borrowing rates as the discount rate for its leases, which is equal to the rate of interest the Company would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. The lease terms for all the Company’s leases include the contractually obligated period of the leases, plus any additional periods covered by Company options to extend the leases that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.\n\nCertain leases provide that the lease payments may be increased annually based on the fixed rate terms or adjustable terms such as the Consumer Price Index. Future base rent escalations that are not contractually quantifiable as of the lease commencement date are not included in our lease liability. \n\nThe following schedule details the total right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022 (in thousands):\n\nLeases| Classification| December 31,2023| December 25,2022  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets  \nFinance lease assets, net| Finance lease right-of-use assets, net| $| 31,740| $| 24,941  \nOperating lease assets, net | Operating lease right-of-use assets| 164,158| 172,425  \nTotal lease assets| $| 195,898| $| 197,366  \nLiabilities  \nCurrent finance lease liabilities| Current finance lease liabilities| $| 9,029| $| 6,850  \nCurrent operating lease liabilities| Current operating lease liabilities| 24,076| 23,418  \nNoncurrent finance lease liabilities| Long-term finance lease liabilities| 24,144| 19,022  \nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities| Long-term operating lease liabilities| 151,050| 160,905  \nTotal lease liabilities| $| 208,299| $| 210,195  \n  \n70\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nLease costs for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021 were as follows:\n\n(Dollars in thousands)| Year Ended  \n---|---  \nDecember 31, 2023| December 25, 2022| December 26, 2021  \nFinance lease:  \nAmortization of right-of-use assets| $| 8,949| $| 5,704| $| 4,980  \nInterest on lease liabilities| 1,542| 1,029| 1,140  \nOperating lease:  \nOperating lease cost| 41,514| 42,815| 43,072  \nShort-term lease cost| 4,239| 4,171| 2,032  \nVariable lease cost| 10,005| 9,129| 8,572  \nTotal lease costs| 66,249| 62,848| 59,796  \nSublease income| (9,842)| (11,654)| (12,039)  \nTotal lease costs, net of sublease income| $| 56,407| $| 51,194| $| 47,757  \n  \nFuture minimum lease payments under contractually-obligated leases and associated sublease income as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\n\nFiscal Year| FinanceLease Costs| OperatingLeaseCosts| Expected Sublease Income  \n---|---|---|---  \n2024| $| 10,266| $| 31,274| $| 8,318  \n2025| 8,616| 35,153| 7,949  \n2026| 7,588| 31,254| 7,229  \n2027| 5,550| 25,418| 6,565  \n2028| 2,610| 19,903| 5,990  \nThereafter| 1,970| 78,136| 27,945  \nTotal future minimum lease payments| 36,600| 221,138| 63,996  \nLess imputed interest| (3,427)| (46,012)| —  \nTotal present value of lease liabilities| $| 33,173| $| 175,126| $| 63,996  \n  \nLessor Operating Leases\n\nThe Company subleases certain retail space to our franchisees in the UK which are primarily operating leases. At December 31, 2023, we leased and subleased approximately 322 Papa John’s restaurants to franchisees in the UK. The initial lease terms on the franchised sites in the UK are generally 15 years. The Company has the option to negotiate an extension toward the end of the lease term at the landlord’s discretion. The initial lease terms of the franchisee subleases are generally five to ten years. Rental income, primarily derived from properties leased and subleased to franchisees in the UK, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective operating lease terms. The Company recognized total sublease income of $9.8 million, $11.7 million and $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively, within Other revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nLease Guarantees\n\nAs a result of assigning our interest in obligations under property leases as a condition of the refranchising of certain restaurants, we are contingently liable for payment of approximately 48 Domestic leases. These leases have varying terms, the latest of which expires in 2036. As of December 31, 2023, the estimated maximum amount of undiscounted payments the Company could be required to make in the event of nonpayment by the primary lessees was $7.3 million. This contingent liability is not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets or future minimum lease obligation. The fair value of the guarantee is not material.\n\nThere were no leases recorded between related parties.\n\n71\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nSupplemental Cash Flow & Other Information\n\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021:\n\n(Dollars in thousands)| Year Ended  \n---|---  \nDecember 31, 2023| December 25, 2022| December 26, 2021  \nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:  \nOperating cash flows from finance leases| $| 1,542| $| 1,029| $| 1,140  \nFinancing cash flows from finance leases| $| 8,821| $| 5,416| $| 4,566  \nOperating cash flows from operating leases (a)| $| 37,814| $| 35,573| $| 38,530  \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities| $| 16,734| $| 9,875| $| 9,486  \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities| $| 24,380| $| 53,869| $| 64,420  \nCash received from sublease income| $| 8,855| $| 10,847| $| 11,597  \nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years):  \nFinance leases| 4.30| 4.43| 4.51  \nOperating leases| 7.81| 8.44| 8.30  \nWeighted-average discount rate:  \nFinance leases| 4.87%| 4.59%| 5.08%  \nOperating leases| 5.62%| 5.63%| 6.20%  \n  \n______________________________\n\n(a)Included within the change in Other assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows offset by non-cash operating lease right-of-use asset amortization and lease liability accretion.\n\n4.

Funding for the share repurchase programs will be provided through our credit facility, operating cash flow, stock option exercises and cash and cash equivalents. \n\nDividends on Common Stock\n\nThe Company paid aggregate cash dividends of approximately $58.5 million ($1.76 per share), $54.8 million ($1.54 per share) and $40.4 million ($1.15 per share) to common stockholders for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nOn January 30, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.46 per common share, representing a $15.1 million aggregate dividend that was paid on February 23, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 12, 2024. The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nThe Company has authorized 5.0 million shares of preferred stock (of which none were issued or outstanding at December 31, 2023 or December 25, 2022, respectively).\n\nOn May 11, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Repurchase Agreement with certain funds affiliated with, or managed by, Starboard Value LP (collectively, “Starboard”), pursuant to which (i) the Company repurchased from Starboard 78,387 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Series B Preferred Stock”) and (ii) Starboard converted the remaining 171,613 shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it owned into 3,458,360 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation of the Series B Preferred Stock. On June 3, 2021, the Company entered into agreements with certain franchisee investors to repurchase 1,000 shares of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock and convert the remaining 1,530 shares of Series B Preferred Stock into 30,769 shares of common stock. The Company paid Starboard and the franchisee investors aggregate one-time cash payments of $188.6 million for the repurchase and conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The excess of the cash payment over the carrying value of the respective Series B Preferred Stock redeemed resulted in $109.9 million of dividends on redemption of Series B Preferred Stock in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which reduced net income attributable to common stockholders and also reduced diluted earnings per share by $3.10 for the year ended December 26, 2021. As a result of the repurchase and conversion, there were no shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued or outstanding at December 31, 2023 or December 25, 2022. \n\nDividends on Series B Preferred Stock\n\nThe Company paid common stock “pass-through” dividends on an as-converted basis to Series B Preferred Stockholders of $1.1 million and preferred dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock of $3.0 million in 2021. The Company also paid $1.5 million of common stock deemed dividend distributions in connection with the repurchase and conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock in 2021.\n\n7. Earnings per Share\n\nWe compute earnings per share using the two-class method. The two-class method requires an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common shareholders and participating security holders according to dividends declared and participating rights in undistributed earnings. Time-based restricted stock awards are participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights and participate in undistributed earnings with common stock. Under the two-class method, total dividends provided to the holders of participating securities and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, are subtracted from net income attributable to the Company in determining net income attributable to common shareholders.\n\nBasic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing the net income attributable to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding consist of basic weighted average common shares outstanding plus weighted average awards outstanding under our equity compensation plans, which are dilutive securities.\n\n75\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nThe calculations of basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021 are as follows (in thousands, except per share data): \n\n2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---  \nBasic earnings per common share  \nNet income attributable to the Company| $| 82,098 | $| 67,772 | $| 120,016  \nDividends on redemption of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock| — | — | (109,852)  \nDividends paid to participating securities| — | (306)| (6,091)  \nNet income attributable to participating securities| — | (104)| —  \nNet income attributable to common shareholders| $| 82,098 | $| 67,362 | $| 4,073  \nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding| 32,931 | 35,497 | 35,007  \nBasic earnings per common share| $| 2.49 | $| 1.90 | $| 0.12  \nDiluted earnings per common share  \nNet income attributable to common shareholders| $| 82,098 | $| 67,362 | $| 4,073  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding| 32,931 | 35,497 | 35,007  \nDilutive effect of outstanding equity awards (a)| 228 | 220 | 330  \nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding| 33,159 | 35,717 | 35,337  \nDiluted earnings per common share| $| 2.48 | $| 1.89 | $| 0.12  \n  \n______________________________\n\n(a)Excludes 194,846 shares underlying equity awards for the year ended December 31, 2023, as the effect of including such awards would have been anti-dilutive, and none in 2022 or 2021.\n\nSee “Note 20. Equity Compensation” for additional information regarding our equity awards, including restricted stock.\n\n8. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n\nThe Company determines the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability to a market participant. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n\n•Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\n•Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\n•Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\n\nFair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity specific measurement. Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value; accordingly, the fair values presented do not necessarily indicate what the Company or its debtholders could realize in a current market exchange.\n\n76\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nOur financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022 are as follows:\n\nCarryingValue| Fair Value Measurements  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3  \nDecember 31, 2023  \nFinancial assets:  \nCash surrender value of life insurance policies (a)| $| 29,449 | $| 29,449 | $| — | $| —  \nInterest rate swaps (b)| $| 107 | $| — | $| 107 | $| —  \nFinancial liabilities:  \nInterest rate swaps (b)| $| 483 | $| — | $| 483 | $| —  \nDecember 25, 2022  \nFinancial assets:  \nCash surrender value of life insurance policies (a)| $| 30,120 | $| 30,120 | $| — | $| —  \nInterest rate swaps (b)| $| 986 | $| — | $| 986 | $| —  \n  \n______________________________\n\n(a)Represents life insurance policies held in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. See “Note 21. Employee Benefit Plans” for additional information.\n\n(b)The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based on the sum of all future net present value cash flows. The future cash flows are derived based on the terms of our interest rate swaps, as well as considering published discount factors, and projected Secured Overnight Financing Rates (“SOFR”). Interest rate swaps entered into prior to 2023 were based on LIBOR.\n\nThere were no transfers among levels within the fair value hierarchy during fiscal 2023 or 2022.\n\nThe fair value of certain assets and liabilities approximates carrying value because of the short-term nature of the accounts, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net of allowances, and accounts payable. The carrying value of notes receivable, net of allowances, also approximates fair value. The Company’s revolving credit facilities under the Company’s credit agreement approximate carrying value due to their variable market-based interest rate. The Company’s 3.875% senior notes are classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement since the Company estimates the fair value by using recent trading transactions, and have the following estimated fair values and carrying values (excluding the impact of unamortized debt issuance costs) as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022:\n\nDecember 31, 2023| December 25, 2022  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)| CarryingValue| FairValue| CarryingValue| FairValue  \n3.875% Senior Notes| $| 400,000 | $| 352,500 | $| 400,000 | $| 339,500  \n  \n9.

Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nEstimates of expected credit losses, even if remote, are based upon historical account write-off trends, facts about the current financial condition of the debtor, forecasts of future operating results based upon current trends of select operating metrics, and macroeconomic factors. Credit quality is monitored through the timing of payments compared to the prescribed payment terms and known facts regarding the financial condition of the franchisee or customer.

The Notes are guaranteed by each of the Company’s existing and future Domestic restricted subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) or other certain indebtedness. The Notes were offered and sold either to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or to persons outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year at a fixed interest rate of 3.875% per annum. In connection with the Notes, the Company recorded $7.1 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized into Net interest expense over the term of the Notes.\n\nThe net proceeds from the Notes, together with borrowings under the Credit Agreement (as defined below), were used to repay outstanding revolver and term loan borrowings under the Company’s Previous Credit Agreement (as defined below).\n\n79\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nThe Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after September 15, 2024 at established redemption prices ranging from 97 to 194 basis points depending on when the Notes are redeemed. At any time prior to September 15, 2024, the Company may also redeem up to 40% of the Notes with net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 103.875% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, excluding the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to September 15, 2024, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and an applicable “make-whole” premium. The Notes also contain customary redemption provisions related to asset sales and certain change of control transactions.\n\nThe Indenture governing the Notes contains customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default, failure to comply with covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or the Notes and certain provisions related to bankruptcy events. The Indenture also contains customary negative covenants.\n\nCredit Agreement\n\nConcurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) replacing the previous credit agreement (“Previous Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate available principal amount of $600.0 million (the “PJI Revolving Facility”), of which up to $40.0 million is available as swingline loans and up to $80.0 million is available as letters of credit. The PJI Revolving Facility will mature on September 14, 2026. The Credit Agreement was amended on May 30, 2023 to update the borrowing benchmark from LIBOR to SOFR with a fixed credit spread adjustment of 0.10%. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company recorded $2.1 million of debt issuance costs during the year ended December 26, 2021, which are being amortized into Net interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement. The remaining availability under the PJI Revolving Facility was $236.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nUp to $50.0 million of the PJI Revolving Facility may be advanced in certain agreed foreign currencies, including Euros, Pounds Sterling, Canadian Dollars, Japanese Yen, and Mexican Pesos. Additionally, the Credit Agreement includes an accordion feature allowing for a future increase of the PJI Revolving Facility and/or incremental term loans in an aggregate amount of up to $500.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from one or more new or existing lenders to provide such increased amounts and ongoing compliance with financial covenants. \n\nLoans under the PJI Revolving Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company’s election, either a SOFR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% or a base rate (generally determined according to the greater of a prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or a SOFR rate plus 1.00%) plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00%. In each case, the actual margin is determined according to a ratio of the Company’s total indebtedness to an earnings calculation, Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), for the then most recently ended four quarter period (the “Leverage Ratio”). An unused commitment fee ranging from 18 to 30 basis points per annum, determined according to the Leverage Ratio, applies to the underutilized commitments under the PJI Revolving Facility. Loans outstanding under the PJI Revolving Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs in the case of borrowings for which a SOFR rate election is in effect.\n\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, require customary reporting obligations, and restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, the consummation of certain mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and similar transactions, the making of investments, equity distributions and other restricted payments, and transactions with affiliates. The Company is subject to the following financial covenants: (1) a maximum Leverage Ratio of 5.25 to 1.00, subject to the Company’s election to increase the maximum Leverage Ratio by 0.50 to 1.00 in connection with material acquisitions if the Company satisfies certain requirements, and (2) a minimum interest coverage ratio defined as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rental expense of 2.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2023.\n\nObligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain direct and indirect material Domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantors”) and are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the capital stock and equity interests of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ Domestic and first tier material foreign subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default including, among other things, payment defaults, breach of covenants, cross acceleration to material indebtedness, bankruptcy-related defaults, judgment defaults, and the occurrence of certain change of control events. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the termination of the PJI Revolving Facility, acceleration of repayment obligations and the exercise of remedies by the Lenders with respect to the Guarantors.\n\n80\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nPJMF Revolving Facility\n\nPJMF has a revolving line of credit (the “PJMF Revolving Facility”) pursuant to a Revolving Loan Agreement, dated September 30, 2015 with U.S. Bank National Association, as lender. On September 30, 2023, the Company amended the PJMF Revolving Facility to, among other items: (i) extend the maturity date to September 30, 2024; (ii) amend the variable interest rate to one-month SOFR plus 1.975%; and (iii) expand the capacity from $20.0 million to $30.0 million.\n\nThe PJMF Revolving Facility is secured by substantially all assets of PJMF. The PJMF Revolving Facility matures on September 30, 2024, but is subject to annual amendments. The borrowings under the PJMF Revolving Facility accrue interest at a variable rate of the one-month SOFR plus 1.975%. There was no debt outstanding under the PJMF Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2023 or December 25, 2022. The PJMF operating results and the related debt outstanding do not impact the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments \n\nOn June 23, 2023, the Company entered into a new interest rate swap with an initial notional value of $100.0 million to replace the Company’s prior interest swaps, which had a notional value of $125.0 million and matured on April 30, 2023. The objective of the interest rate swap is to mitigate the Company’s exposure to the impact of interest rate changes associated with our variable rate debt under the PJI Revolving Facility. We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and will assess hedge effectiveness at regular intervals through the maturity date of June 30, 2025. The interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value at each reporting date, and any unrealized gains or losses are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified to Net interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affect earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have the following interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $100.0 million:\n\nEffective Dates| Floating Rate Debt | Fixed Rates   \n---|---|---  \nJune 23, 2023 through June 30, 2025| $| 50 | million| 4.55 | %  \nJune 23, 2023 through June 30, 2025| $| 50 | million| 4.55 | %  \n  \nIn 2021, our prior interest rate swaps, which matured on April 30, 2023, were de-designated as cash flow hedges following the issuance of the Notes and remained undesignated as hedges through June 26, 2022. For these de-designated hedges, the portion of gains or losses on the derivative instruments previously recognized in AOCL were reclassified into earnings as adjustments to Net interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the originally hedged transactions. \n\nAs of June 27, 2022, the interest rate swaps were re-designated as cash flow hedges to provide a hedge against changes in variable rate cash flows regarding fluctuations in the LIBOR rate previously utilized under the PJI Revolving Facility. Therefore, beginning in the third quarter of 2022 and through the maturity date of April 30, 2023, our prior interest rate swaps were accounted for utilizing cash flow hedge accounting treatment.\n\nWe recognized income of $1.5 million ($1.1 million after tax), $4.8 million ($3.7 million after tax) and $6.8 million ($5.3 million after tax) in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in other comprehensive income for the net change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps.\n\nThe following table provides information on the location and amounts of our swaps in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):\n\nInterest Rate Swap Derivatives  \n---  \nBalance Sheet Location| Fair ValueDecember 31,2023| Fair ValueDecember 25,2022  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets| $| 107 | $| 986  \nOther long-term liabilities| $| 483 | $| —  \n  \nAs of December 31, 2023, the portion of the aggregate $0.4 million interest rate swap liability that would be reclassified into interest expense during the next twelve months is a benefit of approximately $0.1 million.\n\n81\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nThe effect of derivative instruments on the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements is as follows (in thousands):\n\nDerivatives - Cash FlowHedgingRelationships| Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in AOCLon Derivative| Location of (Loss)or Gain Reclassified from AOCL intoIncome| Amount of (Loss)or GainReclassified from AOCL intoIncome| Net Interest Expenseon Consolidated Statements ofOperations  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nInterest rate swaps:  \n2023| $| 1,125 | Net interest expense| $| 173 | $| (43,469)  \n2022| $| 3,663 | Net interest expense| $| (2,384)| $| (25,261)  \n2021| $| 5,273 | Net interest expense| $| (5,965)| $| (17,293)  \n  \nInterest paid, including payments made or received under the swaps, was $37.3 million, $24.4 million and $13.4 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n13.

Restructuring\n\nInternational Restructuring \n\nIn December 2023, the Company announced international transformation initiatives (“International Transformation Plan”) designed to evolve our business structure to deliver an enhanced value proposition to our International customers and franchisees, ensure targeted investments and efficient resource management, and better position our largest markets, including the UK, for long-term profitable growth and brand strength. During the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company commenced approved initiatives under the International Transformation Plan related to establishing new regional hubs across APAC (Asia Pacific), EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), and Latin America that will be led by experienced general managers and their teams.\n\nThe Company incurred restructuring related costs of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the International Transformation Plan. Restructuring related costs associated with the approved initiatives primarily relate to employee severance benefits accounted for under ASC 712, “Compensation - Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits”, professional services, recruiting and relocation costs, and stock-based compensation forfeitures on unvested awards. These costs were included in General and administrative expensesin the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total estimated pre-tax costs associated with approved initiatives in 2023 are approximately $3.0 million to $6.0 million, all of which will be recorded within our International segment, and we expect to incur the remainder of these costs through 2024. These estimates will be updated as additional initiatives associated with the International Transformation Plan are developed and approved. Refer to Note 25. Subsequent Events for further details on initiatives approved by our Board of Directors subsequent to December 31, 2023.\n\nThe following table summarizes restructuring related costs recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,2023  \n---  \nEmployee severance| $| 1,522  \nProfessional services| 527  \nRecruiting| 150  \nTotal international transformation costs| 2,199  \nStock-based compensation forfeitures on unvested awards| (21)  \nTotal international transformation costs, net of stock-based award forfeitures| $| 2,178  \n  \nThe following table presents changes in the balance of accrued expenses relating to approved initiatives, which are recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands): \n\n83\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nEmployee severance| Professional services| Recruiting| Total  \n---|---|---|---  \nBalance as of December 25, 2022| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| —  \nCharges | 1,522| 527| 150| 2,199  \nPayments | (295)| —| (121)| (416)  \nBalance as of December 31, 2023| $| 1,227| $| 527| $| 29| $| 1,783  \n  \nStrategic Corporate Reorganization (2021)\n\nOn September 17, 2020, we announced plans to open an office in Atlanta, Georgia located in Three Ballpark Center at The Battery Atlanta, which opened in October 2021. The space is designed to drive continued menu innovation and optimize integration across marketing, communications, customer experience, operations, human resources, diversity, equity and inclusion, financial planning and analysis, investor relations and development functions. Our information technology, finance, supply chain, and legal teams continue to operate in our Louisville, Kentucky office, which remains critical to our success. We also maintain an office outside of London, UK, where our International operations are managed. Employees whose positions were relocated to the new Atlanta office were either offered an opportunity to continue with the organization or were offered a severance package. As a result, we incurred one-time corporate reorganization costs of approximately $13.1 million during the year ended December 26, 2021 as detailed in the table below (in thousands). \n\nDecember 26,2021  \n---  \nEmployee severance and other employee transition costs| $| 5,429  \nRecruiting and professional fees| 3,815  \nRelocation costs| 3,100  \nOther costs| 750  \nTotal strategic corporate reorganization costs| $| 13,094  \n  \nThere were no additional corporate reorganization costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 or December 25, 2022, and all costs incurred during 2021 were paid by December 25, 2022.\n\nWe record severance as a one-time termination benefit and recognize the expense ratably over the employees’ required future service period. All other costs, including employee transition costs, recruitment and relocation costs, and third-party costs, are recognized in the period incurred. All strategic corporate reorganization costs were recorded in General and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n17.

Our ability to utilize these foreign tax credit carryforwards is dependent on our ability to generate foreign earnings in future years sufficient to claim foreign tax credits in excess of foreign taxes paid in those years. The Company provided a full valuation allowance of $23.9 million and $20.2 million for these foreign tax credit carryforwards as we believe realization based on the more-likely-than-not criteria has not been met as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively.\n\nCash for income taxes paid were $12.5 million in 2023, $11.7 million in 2022 and $32.6 million in 2021.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company, with few exceptions, is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-US income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2019. The Company is currently undergoing examinations by various tax authorities.\n\nThe Company had $1.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2023 which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties is as follows, which is recorded in Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):\n\nBalance at December 26, 2021| $| 896  \n---|---|---  \nAdditions for tax positions of prior years| 331  \nReductions for tax positions of prior years| (65)  \nBalance at December 25, 2022| $| 1,162  \nAdditions for tax positions of prior years| 217  \nReductions for tax positions of prior years| (321)  \nBalance at December 31, 2023| $| 1,058  \n  \nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense. The Company has accrued approximately $0.1 million for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022.\n\n18. Related Party Transactions \n\nShaquille O’Neal\n\nOn March 21, 2019, Shaquille O’Neal was appointed to our Board of Directors. On June 11, 2019, PJMF entered into an Endorsement Agreement (the “Original Endorsement Agreement”), effective March 15, 2019, with ABG-Shaq, LLC (“ABG-Shaq”), an entity affiliated with Mr. O’Neal, for the personal services of Mr. O’Neal. Pursuant to the Original Endorsement Agreement, the Company received the right and license to use Mr. O’Neal’s name, nickname, initials, autograph, voice, video or film portrayals, photograph, likeness and certain other intellectual property rights (individually and collectively, the “Personality Rights”), in each case, solely as approved by ABG-Shaq, in connection with the advertising, promotion and sale of Papa John’s-branded products. Mr. O’Neal also agreed to provide brand ambassador services related to appearances, social media and public relations matters, and to collaborate with us to develop one or more co-branded products using the Personality Rights. Mr. O’Neal and the Company developed a co-branded extra-large pizza product using the Personality Rights under an amendment to the Original Endorsement Agreement signed July 27, 2020 (the “First Amendment”).\n\nAs consideration for the rights and services granted under the Original Endorsement Agreement, the Company agreed to pay to ABG-Shaq aggregate cash payments of $4.1 million over the three years of the Original Endorsement Agreement. The Company also paid expenses related to the marketing and personal services provided by Mr. O’Neal. In addition, the Company agreed to grant 87,136 restricted stock units to Mr. O’Neal (as agent of ABG) under our 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. \n\nOn July 29, 2021, the Company and PJMF entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Second Amendment”) to the Original Endorsement Agreement with ABG-Shaq. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company was granted the ability to use the Personality Rights for a limited time to promote, advertise, and sell our co-branded extra-large pizza developed under the First Amendment. ABG-Shaq did not receive any additional royalty fees from the Company beyond the cash payment already contemplated under the Original Endorsement Agreement under the Amendment. In addition, the Company \n\n87\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\ndonated one U.S. dollar for each unit of the pizza sold in the United States and one Canadian dollar for each unit sold in Canada to The Papa John’s Foundation for Building Community. \n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Original Endorsement Agreement expired by its terms. On April 10, 2022, the Company and PJMF entered into a new Endorsement Agreement (the “New Endorsement Agreement”), effective March 15, 2022, with ABG-Shaq, LLC (“ABG-Shaq”), to replace the Original Endorsement Agreement.\n\nThe terms of the New Endorsement Agreement are substantially similar to the Original Endorsement Agreement. As consideration for the rights and services granted under the New Endorsement Agreement, the Company and PJMF agreed to pay to ABG-Shaq aggregate cash payments of $5.6 million over the three years of the New Endorsement Agreement. The Company and PJMF will also pay ABG-Shaq a royalty fee for the co-branded pizza product if the total amount of royalties in a given contract year (calculated as $0.20 per co-branded pizza sold) exceeds the contractual cash payment for that year, in which case the amount of the royalty payment will be the excess of the royalties over the cash payment amount. The Company did not pay royalties in 2023 and 2022 for the co-branded pizza promotion. The Company and PJMF will also pay expenses related to the marketing and personal services provided by Mr. O’Neal.\n\nIn addition, the Company agreed to grant 55,898 restricted stock units (the “RSUs”) to Mr. O’Neal (as agent of ABG) under the Company’s 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The RSUs will vest into an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s common stock according to the following vesting schedule:\n\n● 33% (18,632) of the RSUs vested on April 12, 2023;\n\n● 33% (18,632) of the RSUs will vest on March 15, 2024; and\n\n● 33% (18,634) of the RSUs will vest on March 15, 2025.\n\nThe initial term of the New Endorsement Agreement ends on March 15, 2025, with an option for a one-year extension upon the parties’ mutual agreement. The New Endorsement Agreement also includes customary exclusivity, termination and indemnification clauses.\n\nEffective August 1, 2023, the Company and PJMF entered into Amendment No. 1 to the New Endorsement Agreement (“Amendment No. 1”). As consideration for rights and services granted within Amendment No. 1, the Company agreed to a pay a minimum donation of $375,000 for the benefit of The Shaquille O’Neal Foundation, of which $125,000 was paid during 2023 with the remaining $250,000 to be paid during 2024.\n\nStarboard Share Repurchase\n\nOn March 1, 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares from certain funds affiliated with, or managed by, Starboard Value LP (collectively, “Starboard”), at $82.52 per share, for a total aggregate consideration of $179.6 million. The transaction was negotiated by an independent committee of the Board of Directors formed for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction involving Starboard, and was approved by the full Board upon such independent committee’s recommendation. Starboard’s Chief Executive Officer is Jeffrey Smith, who previously served as the Company’s Chairman of the Board until his resignation on March 1, 2023.\n\n19. Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies\n\nLitigation\n\nThe Company is involved in a number of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those specifically identified below, consisting of intellectual property, employment, consumer, commercial and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with ASC 450, “Contingencies,” the Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. \n\nIn re Papa John’s Employee & Franchise Employee Antitrust Litigation is a putative class action filed in December 2018 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. The suit alleges that the “no-poaching” provision previously contained in the Company’s franchise agreement constituted an unlawful agreement or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. On April 14, 2022, the parties reached a \n\n88\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nsettlement in principle to resolve the case. Pursuant to the terms of the proposed settlement, in exchange for the Company’s payment of a total aggregate settlement amount of $5.0 million and other non-monetary consideration, all claims in the action will be dismissed, the litigation will be terminated, and the Company will receive a release. The settlement amount was recorded in General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the first quarter of 2022 and remained accrued in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023. The proposed settlement is subject to approval by the District Court and contains certain customary contingencies. The Company continues to deny any liability or wrongdoing in this matter. \n\nCommitments and Contingencies\n\nWe have certain other commercial commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. With our insurance programs, we are party to surety bonds with off-balance sheet risk for a total of $20.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses. These arrangements have not had, and are unlikely to have in the future, a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nWe guarantee leases for certain Papa Johns North American franchisees who have purchased restaurants that were previously Company-owned. We are contingently liable on these leases. The leases have varying terms, the latest of which expires in 2036. As of December 31, 2023, the estimate maximum amount of undiscounted payments the Company could be required to make in the event of nonpayment by the primary lessees was approximately $7.3 million. This contingent liability is not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets or our future minimum lease obligations. The fair value of the guarantee is not material.\n\n20. Equity Compensation\n\nWe award time-based restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock units, and stock options from time to time under the Papa John’s International, Inc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. There were approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock authorized for issuance and remaining available under the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2023, which includes 5.9 million shares transferred from the Papa John’s International 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan. \n\nWe recorded stock-based employee compensation expense of $17.9 million in 2023, $18.4 million in 2022 and $16.9 million in 2021. At December 31, 2023, there was $18.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards, of which the Company expects to recognize $12.4 million in 2024, $5.6 million in 2025 and $0.9 million in 2026.\n\nStock Options\n\nOptions exercised, which were issued from authorized shares, included 43,000 shares in 2023, 82,000 shares in 2022 and 212,000 shares in 2021. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $1.2 million, $3.4 million and $10.1 million, respectively. \n\nThere were no options granted in 2023, 2022 or 2021. Information pertaining to option activity during 2023 is as follows (number of options and aggregate intrinsic value in thousands):\n\nNumberofOptions| WeightedAverageExercisePrice| WeightedAverageRemainingContractualTerm(In Years)| AggregateIntrinsicValue  \n---|---|---|---  \nOutstanding at December 25, 2022| 235| $| 56.53  \nExercised| (43)| 52.56  \nCancelled| (1)| 70.96  \nOutstanding at December 31, 2023| 191| $| 57.35 | 3.60| $| 3,681  \nExercisable at December 31, 2023| 191| $| 57.35 | 3.60| $| 3,681  \n  \nRestricted Stock\n\nWe granted shares of restricted stock that are time-based and generally vest in equal installments over three years (190,000 in 2023, 165,000 in 2022 and 130,000 in 2021). Upon vesting, the shares are issued from treasury stock.

We consider time-based restricted stock awards to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights. We declared dividends totaling $0.5 million ($1.76 per share) in 2023, $0.5 million ($1.54 per share) in 2022 and $0.4 million ($1.15 per share) in 2021 to holders of time-based restricted stock. \n\nWe granted 14,000, 69,000 and 11,000 restricted stock units that are time-based and vest over a period of one to three years in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Upon vesting, the units are issued from treasury stock. Total dividends declared for these awards were insignificant to the results of our operations.\n\nAdditionally, we granted stock settled performance-based restricted stock units to executive management (80,000 units in 2023, 64,000 units in 2022, and 61,000 units in 2021). \n\nThe performance-based restricted stock units require the achievement of certain performance and market factors, which consist of the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to a predetermined peer group. The grant-date fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units was determined through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe following is a summary of the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n\nAssumptions:| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nRisk-free interest rate| 4.5 | %| 1.5 | %| 0.2 | %  \nExpected volatility| 38.6 | %| 45.0 | %| 48.3 | %  \n  \nThe risk-free interest rate for the periods within the contractual life of the performance-based restricted stock unit is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility was estimated using the Company’s historical share price volatility for a period similar to the expected life of the performance-based restricted stock unit.\n\nThe performance-based restricted stock units granted vest over three years (cliff vest) and are expensed over the performance period. The weighted average grant-date fair value of performance-based restricted stock units granted during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $88.43, $113.90 and $103.14, respectively.\n\nThe fair value of time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units is based on the market price of the Company’s shares on the grant date. Information pertaining to these awards during 2023 is as follows (shares in thousands):\n\nShares| WeightedAverageGrant-DateFair Value  \n---|---  \nTotal as of December 25, 2022| 518| $| 91.23  \nGranted| 283| 84.13  \nForfeited| (92)| 95.18  \nVested| (226)| 75.88  \nTotal as of December 31, 2023| 483| $| 93.27  \n  \n21. Employee Benefit Plans\n\nThe Papa John’s International, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), is a defined contribution benefit plan in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 401(k) Plan is open to employees who meet certain eligibility requirements and allows participating employees to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and contribute such amount to one or more investment funds. \n\nIn addition, we maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan available to certain employees and directors. Under this plan, the participants may defer a certain amount of their compensation, which is credited to the participants’ accounts. The participant-directed investments associated with this plan are included in Other assets ($29.4 million and $30.1 million \n\n90\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nat December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively) and the associated liabilities ($28.3 million at December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022) are included in Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nWe contributed a matching payment of 4% of a participating employee’s earnings deferred into the 401(k) Plan in 2023 and 2022. In 2021, we contributed a discretionary matching payment of 4%, up to a maximum of 6% of a participating employee’s earnings deferred into both the 401(k) Plan and the non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Such costs were $4.3 million in 2023, $4.4 million in 2022 and $3.5 million in 2021.\n\n22. Divestitures\n\nDivestiture of Preferred Marketing Solutions\n\nOn October 22, 2023, we sold the operations of Preferred Marketing Solutions, our previously wholly-owned print and promotions company, for upfront consideration of $0.6 million as well as a percentage of future revenues to be paid on a quarterly basis over the next ten years. In connection with the divestiture, we deconsolidated total net assets of approximately $1.2 million, which primarily included property and equipment of $0.6 million and goodwill of $0.4 million associated with Preferred Marketing Solutions. There was no gain or loss recognized on the sale, and the impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements was not material for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nRefranchising Loss\n\nOn March 28, 2022, we refranchised our 51.0% ownership interest in a 90-restaurant consolidated joint venture in Texas for $14.0 million, net of transaction costs. In connection with the divestiture, we recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $8.4 million in Refranchising and impairment loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which reflects net sale proceeds of $14.0 million, the noncontrolling interest of $4.2 million, and the recognition of an unearned royalty stream of $12.2 million to be recognized as revenue over the 10-year term of the franchise agreement executed concurrent with the disposition in accordance with ASC 810, “Consolidation.” Goodwill of $9.9 million was allocated to the disposal group based on relative fair value within the Domestic Company-owned restaurants reporting group. The $8.4 million of the one-time, non-cash refranchising loss was recorded in the first quarter of 2022 and realized upon consummation of the sale in the second quarter of 2022. \n\nImpairment of Reacquired Master Franchise Rights\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded an impairment of $2.8 million in Refranchising and impairment loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for reacquired franchise rights due to the financial and operational impact of the conflict in Ukraine and government actions taken in response to that conflict, including, but not limited to, international sanctions. The reacquired franchise rights were previously acquired from a former master franchisee and capitalized by the Company.\n\n23. Segment Information\n\nWe have four reportable segments: Domestic Company-owned restaurants, North America franchising, North America commissaries, and International operations. The Domestic Company-owned restaurant segment consists of the operations of all Domestic Company-owned restaurants and principally generates revenues from retail sales of pizza, Papadias, and side items, including breadsticks, Papa Bites, cheesesticks, boneless chicken wings and bone-in chicken wings, dessert items and canned or bottled beverages. The North America franchising segment consists of our franchise sales and support activities and derives its revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and collection of royalties from our franchisees located in the United States and Canada. The North America commissary segment consists of the operations of our regional dough production and product distribution centers and derives its revenues principally from the sale and distribution of food and paper products to Domestic Company-owned and franchised restaurants in the United States and Canada. The International segment consists of the operations of all Company-owned restaurants located in the UK, as well as distribution sales to franchised Papa Johns restaurants located in the UK and our franchise sales and support activities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our International franchisees. International franchisees are defined as all franchise operations outside of the United States and Canada. All other business units that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments, which are not operating segments, we refer to as “all other,” which consists of operations that derive revenues from the sale, principally \n\n91\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nto Company-owned and franchised restaurants, of printing and promotional items, franchise contributions to marketing funds and information systems and related services used in restaurant operations, including our point-of-sale system, online and other technology-based ordering platforms.\n\nGenerally, we evaluate performance and allocate resources based on operating income. Certain administrative and capital costs are allocated to segments based upon predetermined rates or estimated resource usage.

These amounts include marketing fund contributions and sublease rental income from International franchisees in the UK that provide no significant contribution to income before income taxes but must be reported on a gross basis under accounting requirements. The related expenses for these Other revenues are reported in Other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n24. Acquisitions\n\nUK Franchisee Acquisitions\n\nAs part of our investment to reposition our UK business, in 2023 we acquired a portfolio of Company-owned restaurants in the UK market that were previously franchised. Our control and ownership of this portfolio enables us to implement operating model enhancements in the restaurants including revenue management capabilities, product and technological innovation and operational efficiencies to improve sales and restaurant-level profitability, and to drive initiatives for future growth and profitability in the Company’s largest market outside of North America. As part of this investment, the Company acquired 91 Papa Johns restaurants previously operated by the M25 division of Drake Food Service International in the United Kingdom on June 2, 2023 for total consideration of approximately $13.7 million. The Company acquired an additional 27 Papa Johns restaurants in the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2023 for total consideration of approximately $1.5 million. Collectively, we refer to these acquisitions as the “UK franchisee acquisitions.”\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred $2.1 million of acquisition and transition costs related to the UK franchisee acquisitions. These expenses were recorded within General and administrative expenses and within the International segment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The results of operations of the acquired restaurants after their respective acquisition dates are included within the International segment in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impact of the acquisitions was not material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe UK franchisee acquisitions have been accounted for as business combinations. As such, the Company concluded that the consideration was measured at fair value and has recorded the preliminary estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the respective acquisition dates. Total consideration was approximately $15.2 million, of which $13.7 million was pre-existing accounts receivable and notes receivable and is classified as a noncash investing transaction within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2023. Assets acquired include approximately $10.6 million of property and equipment, net, $0.3 million of inventories and other assets and $4.3 million of goodwill. No measurement period adjustments related to the UK franchisee acquisitions have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023\n\nThe total goodwill recognized in conjunction with the UK franchisee acquisitions, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, has been assigned to the International operating segment. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired, which resulted in the recognition of goodwill, primarily due to synergies created from expected future benefits stemming from implementation of the Company’s operational capabilities and further control of the \n\n95\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nCompany’s brand name in our most prominent international market. Goodwill also includes certain other benefits that do not qualify for recognition as intangible assets, such as an assembled workforce.\n\nDomestic Acquisitions\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we acquired ten Domestic restaurants for a total purchase price of $4.1 million, which was classified as cash used in investing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The impact of the acquisitions was not material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquired assets recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 primarily included restaurant property and equipment of $1.6 million, reacquired franchise rights of $1.3 million, and goodwill of $1.1 million. These amounts include measurement period adjustments to increase property and equipment and reduce reacquired franchise rights by $0.2 million, which were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe amounts recorded as a result of our preliminary acquisition accounting for the UK franchisee acquisitions and Domestic acquisitions are subject to change and further refinement. The Company is finalizing its valuation of acquired property and equipment as well as gathering and assessing information regarding leases and other assets. The Company expects all outstanding items to be finalized prior to the one-year anniversary date of the respective acquisitions.\n\n25. Subsequent Events\n\nIn February 2024, as the next phase of the International Transformation Plan discussed in Note 16, “Restructuring,” the Board of Directors approved a plan to close approximately 50 underperforming Company-owned restaurants in the United Kingdom during the first six months of 2024. The purpose of this plan is to optimize the Company's restaurant portfolio in the UK and improve overall profitability by closing unprofitable locations and allowing us to focus on improving profitability across our remaining portfolio of Company-owned restaurants and franchisee base in the UK.\n\nAs a result of this decision, the Company expects to incur restructuring charges of approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million, which will be recognized during 2024 within our International segment. These charges are expected to primarily consist of lease right-of-use asset and fixed asset impairment charges, employee severance, and other related expenses. The estimated range of restructuring charges is based on management's best estimate at the time of this filing and is subject to change as additional information becomes available. The actual charges may differ from the estimates due to various factors, including the evaluation of our ability to sublease the closed restaurant properties and the number of employees affected by the restaurant closures.\n\n96\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nItem 9.

Controls and Procedures\n\n(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\n\n(b)Management’s Report on our Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission (“2013 Framework”). Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\n\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of its audit, has issued an attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n(c)Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n97\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Papa John’s International, Inc. \n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited Papa John’s International, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Papa John’s International, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based onthe COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company, and our report dated February 29, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on our Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nLouisville, Kentucky\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\n98\n\n[Table of Contents](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)[ ](#i51615056582e47258ee73fc319371b9c_7)\n\nItem 9B.

Business\nGeneral\nPapa John’s International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as the “Company,” “Papa John’s,” “Papa Johns” or in the first person notations of “we,”\n“us” and “our”), operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants and, in certain international markets, dine-in and delivery restaurants under\nthe trademark “Papa John’s.” Papa John’s began operations in 1984. At December 25, 2022, there were 5,706 Papa John’s restaurants in operation,\nconsisting of 522 Company-owned and 5,184 franchised restaurants operating in 48 countries and territories. Our Company-owned restaurants include 98\nrestaurants operated under three joint venture arrangements. All of our International restaurants are franchised. In discussions of our business, “Domestic”\nis defined as within the contiguous United States, “North America” includes Canada, and “International” includes the rest of the world other than North\nAmerica.\nStrategy\nWe are committed to delivering on our brand promise “BETTER INGREDIENTS. BETTER PIZZA.®” and a business strategy designed to drive\nsustainable long-term, profitable growth. Papa John’s is driven by five strategic priorities:\nBuild a culture of leaders who believe in diversity, inclusivity and winning. A diverse, inclusive environment is essential to attracting the talent that makes\nPapa Johns the world’s best pizza delivery company. See the “Human Capital” section below where we discuss our ongoing initiatives in this area.\nRe-establish the superiority of our pizza via commercial platforms. We believe that using high quality ingredients leads to superior quality pizzas. Our\noriginal crust pizza dough is made from six simple ingredients and is fresh, never frozen. We also top our pizzas with our signature pizza sauce made with\nvine-ripened tomatoes, real cheese and meat full of flavor, not filler. Our marketing and menu strategies focus on menu innovations that provide both value\nand variety to our customers, but importantly, do not add significant complexity to our restaurant operations or to supply chain needs. Over the past three\nyears, we have made purposeful additions to our menu, ensuring these additions are well-timed for our growth, without sacrificing our premium quality.\nThis deliberate strategy focuses on innovation that adds value to our system rather than short-term discounts, contributing to more productive ticket growth\nand, most importantly, higher customer satisfaction. We believe in the importance of providing options that appeal to our customers’ diverse dietary needs\nand preferences, and our nutritionists and food innovation teams are continuously looking for ways to reflect this in our menu. Our product innovations\nform the foundation of our strategy for growing comparable sales and improving unit economics.\nImprove unit-level profitability and performance of our Company and franchisee restaurants. We have been intent on taking proactive steps to drive\nprofitable growth, especially under the current challenging operating environment. This includes growing ticket and transactions through menu\ninnovations, customer insights and strategic pricing actions. In addition to increasing average unit volumes, our strategy focuses on further sharpening our\nexecution and driving BETTER customer experience for faster service while optimizing labor allocation, enhancing operational efficiencies and effectively\nmanaging margins.\nLeverage our technology infrastructure to drive our business operations. We utilize technology to deliver a better customer experience, improve\noperational efficiencies and inform our decision-making. Approximately 85% of our Domestic sales are through digital channels, including website, apps,\nthird party aggregators, and centralized call centers, providing a significant competitive advantage when compared with other QSR models. We are\ncontinuously investing in technology to enhance our digital capabilities for both our customers as well as our employees. Our loyalty program (“Papa\nRewards”) and one-to-one marketing platforms help us retain loyal customers and attract new ones. We also partner with top domestic delivery aggregators\nto meet customer demand for our products. Aggregators have also helped navigate the labor shortage that the Company is experiencing by providing\nsupplemental delivery drivers, especially during peak times when our delivery teams are working at full capacity. Our integrations with the aggregator\nmarketplaces and our nationwide integration with a third-party delivery service provider have been key tools allowing us to continue to meet our customers\nin the channel of their choice.\nProfitably expand our footprint domestically and internationally. We continue to pursue a growth strategy by expanding our footprint, both domestically\nand internationally. We partner with large local investors to expand into new regions and markets, seeking to ensure our partners are aligned with our\nstrategic priorities and committed to the Papa Johns brand. Nearly all of our top-25 North American franchisees now have development agreements in\nplace. Internationally, our teams\n3\nTable of Contents\nare laying the groundwork for the future by accelerating growth in our established markets, identifying attractive new markets to enter and attracting new\nwell-capitalized franchisees to partner with.\nA large majority of Papa John’s restaurants are franchised. We believe a franchised model provides resiliency of earnings and presents us with an\nopportunity to enhance growth with less capital investment than a traditional company-operated restaurant model. We seek to attract and retain franchisees\nwith experience in restaurant or retail operations and with the financial resources and management capabilities to open single or multiple locations. While\neach Papa John’s franchisee manages and operates its own restaurants and business, we devote significant resources to providing franchisees with\nassistance in restaurant operations, quality assurance, technology, training, marketing, site selection and restaurant design. Papa John’s franchise owners\nbenefit from our award-winning brand, food service capabilities and the Papa John’s digital and delivery model.\nSegment Overview\nPapa John’s has four defined reportable segments: Domestic Company-owned restaurants, North America franchising, North America commissaries\n(Quality Control Centers), and International operations.\nDomestic Company-owned Restaurants\nThe Domestic Company-owned restaurant segment consists of the operations of all Domestic Company-owned restaurants and derives its revenues\nprincipally from retail sales of pizza, Papadias, and side items, including breadsticks, Papa Bites, cheesesticks, chicken poppers and wings, dessert items\nand canned or bottled beverages.\nOf the total 3,376 North American restaurants open as of December 25, 2022, 522 units, or approximately 15%, were Company-owned. In 2022, the 514\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants included in the full year’s comparable restaurant base generated average annual unit sales of $1.3 million.\nOperating Company-owned restaurants allows us to improve operations, training, marketing and quality standards for the benefit of the entire Papa John’s\nsystem.\nNorth America franchising\nThe North America franchising segment consists of our franchise sales and support activities and derives its revenues from the sale of franchise and\ndevelopment rights and the collection of royalties from our franchisees located in the United States and Canada. Our North American franchised\nrestaurants, which included 2,472 restaurants in the full year’s comparable base for 2022, generated average annual unit sales of $1.1 million. These sales,\nwhile not included in the Company’s revenues, contribute to our royalty revenues, franchisee marketing fund contributions, and commissary revenue.\nNorth America commissary\nThe North America commissary segment comprises 11 full-service regional dough production and distribution Quality Control Centers (“QC Centers”) in\nthe United States, which supply pizza sauce, dough, food products, paper products, smallwares and cleaning supplies twice weekly to each traditional\nrestaurant served. This system enables us to monitor and control product quality and consistency while lowering food and other costs. We also have one QC\nCenter in Canada, which produces and distributes fresh dough. We evaluate the QC Center system capacity in relation to existing restaurants’ volumes and\nplanned restaurant growth, and facilities are developed or upgraded as operational or economic conditions warrant. To ensure consistent food quality, each\nDomestic franchisee is required to purchase dough and pizza sauce from our QC Centers and to purchase all other supplies from our QC Centers or other\napproved suppliers.\nInternational\nInternational franchisees are defined as all franchise operations outside of the United States and Canada. As of December 25, 2022, there were 2,330\nInternational restaurants, all of which are franchised. The International segment principally consists of distribution sales to franchised Papa John’s\nrestaurants located in the UK and our franchise sales and support activities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the\ncollection of royalties from our International franchisees. The Company currently operates one International QC Center, which is in the UK. Other QC\nCenters outside North America are operated by franchisees pursuant to license agreements or by other third parties.\n4\nTable of Contents\nAll others\nAll other business units that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments, which are not operating segments, we refer to as\n“all others.” These consist of operations that derive revenues from franchise contributions to our marketing funds and the sale, principally to Company-\nowned and franchised restaurants, of information systems and related services used in restaurant operations, including our point-of-sale system, online and\nother technology-based ordering platforms, and printing and promotional items.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 23. Segment Information” of “Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements” for financial information about our segments.\nDevelopment\nAt December 25, 2022, there were 5,706 Papa John’s restaurants operating in 48 countries and territories, as follows:\nDomestic Company- Franchised North\nowned America Total North America International(a) System-wide\nBeginning - December 26, 2021 600 2,739 3,339 2,311 5,650\nOpened 10 76 86 292 378\nClosed — (49) (49) (85) (134)\nSold — (2) (2) — (2)\nAcquired 2 — 2 — 2\nRefranchised (90) 90 — — —\nSuspended (a) — — — (188) (188)\nEnding - December 25, 2022 522 2,854 3,376 2,330 5,706\nNet unit growth/(decline) (a) (78) 115 37 207 244\n______________________________\n(a) As previously disclosed, the Company has suspended corporate support for all franchised restaurants located in Russia. These suspended restaurants are excluded from net unit growth\ncalculations.\nOur Company-owned restaurant growth strategy is to continue to open Domestic restaurants in existing markets as appropriate, thereby increasing\nconsumer awareness and enabling us to take advantage of operational and marketing scale efficiencies. Our experience in developing markets indicates that\nmarket penetration through the opening of multiple restaurants in a particular market results in increased average restaurant sales in that market over time.\nWe have co-developed Domestic markets with some franchisees or divided markets among franchisees and will continue to use market co-development in\nthe future, where appropriate.\nFranchise Program\nWe continue to attract qualified and experienced franchisees, whom we consider to be a vital part of our system’s continued growth. We believe our\nrelationship with our franchisees is fundamental to the performance of our brand and we strive to maintain a collaborative relationship with our franchisees.\nFranchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant’s business background, restaurant operating experience and financial resources.\nNorth America Development and Franchise Agreements. We enter into development agreements with our franchisees in North America for the opening of a\nspecified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area. The franchise agreement is generally executed once a\nfranchisee secures a location. Our current standard franchise agreement requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 5% of sales, and the majority of our\nexisting franchised restaurants have a 5% contractual royalty rate in effect. Incentives to franchisees offered from time to time may reduce the contractual\nroyalty rate paid.\nSubstantially all existing franchise agreements have an initial 10-year term with a 10-year renewal option. We have the right to terminate a franchise\nagreement for a variety of reasons, including a franchisee’s failure to make payments when due or failure to adhere to our operational policies and\nstandards. Many state franchise laws limit our ability as a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise.\n5\nTable of Contents\nInternational Development and Franchise Agreements. In international markets, we have either a development agreement or a master franchise agreement\nwith a franchisee for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area. Under a master\nfranchise agreement, the franchisee has the right to sub-franchise a portion of the development to one or more sub-franchisees approved by us.\nOur current standard international master franchise and development agreements provide for payment to us of a royalty fee of 5% of sales. For international\nmarkets with sub-franchise agreements, the effective sub-franchise royalty received by the Company is generally 3% of sales and the master franchisee\ngenerally receives a royalty of 2% of sales. The remaining terms applicable to the operation of individual restaurants are substantially equivalent to the\nterms of our Domestic franchise agreement. Development agreements will be negotiated at other-than-standard terms for fees and royalties, and we may\noffer various development and royalty incentives.\nFranchise Operations. All franchisees are required to operate their Papa John’s restaurants in compliance with our policies, standards and specifications,\nincluding matters such as menu items, ingredients, and restaurant design. Franchisees have full discretion in human resource practices, and generally have\nfull discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers, but we generally have the authority to set maximum price points for nationally advertised\npromotions.\nFranchisee Loans. Selected Domestic and International franchisees have borrowed funds from us, principally for the purchase of restaurants from us or\nother franchisees or, in certain international markets, for construction and development of new restaurants. Loans made to franchisees can bear interest at\nfixed or floating rates and in most cases are secured by the fixtures, equipment and signage of the restaurant and/or are guaranteed by the franchise owners.\nAt December 25, 2022, net loans outstanding totaled $28.1 million. See “Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements” for additional information.\nMarketing Programs\nOur Domestic marketing strategy consists of both national and local components. Our national strategy includes national advertising via television, print,\ndirect mail, digital, mobile marketing and social media channels. Our digital marketing activities have increased significantly over the past several years in\nresponse to increasing customer use of online and mobile technology. Local advertising programs include television, radio, print, direct mail, store-to-door\nflyers, digital, mobile marketing and local social media channels.\nDomestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s restaurants within a defined market may be required to join an area advertising cooperative (“Co-\nop”). Each member restaurant contributes a percentage of sales to the Co-op for market-wide programs, such as television, radio, digital and print\nadvertising, and sports sponsorships. The rate of contribution and uses of the monies collected are determined by a majority vote of the Co-op’s members.\nThe restaurant-level and Co-op marketing efforts are supported by media, print, digital and electronic advertising materials that are produced by Papa\nJohn’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”), our national marketing fund. PJMF is a consolidated nonstock corporation, designed to operate at break-even for\nthe purpose of designing and administering advertising and promotional programs for all participating Domestic restaurants. PJMF produces and buys air\ntime for Papa John’s national television commercials and advertises the Company’s products through digital media including banner advertising, paid\nsearch-engine advertising, mobile marketing, social media advertising and marketing, text messaging, and email. PJMF also engages in other brand-\nbuilding activities, such as consumer research and public relations activities. Domestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s restaurants are\nrequired to contribute a certain minimum percentage of sales to PJMF.\nIn international markets, our marketing focuses on reaching customers who live or work within a small radius of a Papa John’s restaurant. Our international\nmarkets use a combination of advertising strategies, including television, radio, print, digital, mobile marketing and local social media depending on the\nsize of the local market.\nHuman Capital\nOur team members are critical to our success. As of December 25, 2022, we employed approximately 12,000 persons, of whom approximately 9,600 were\nteam members at Company-owned restaurants, approximately 700 were management personnel at Company-owned restaurants, approximately 700 were\ncorporate personnel and approximately 1,100 were QC Center and our print and promotions subsidiary personnel. Our team members are non-unionized,\nand most restaurant team members work part-time and are paid on an hourly basis.\n6\nTable of Contents\nOur franchisees are independent business owners, so their employees are not our employees and therefore are not included in our employee count. We\nestimate the total number of persons in the Papa John’s system, including our team members, franchisees and the team members of franchisees, was\napproximately 115,000 as of December 25, 2022.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nAt Papa Johns, we welcome a wide array of voices to our table. A diverse, inclusive environment is essential to attracting the talent that makes Papa Johns\nthe world’s best pizza delivery company. As such, we welcome all entrepreneurial spirits, innovators and pizza lovers. We are building a culture that both\nreflects our corporate values of People First and Everyone Belongs and creates a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining talent. Across our\nrestaurants, Quality Control Centers and corporate hubs, Papa Johns team members are valued for their contributions, treated equitably, encouraged to share\ntheir feedback and ideas, provided the tools needed to ensure their safety and total wellness and given ample opportunities to grow in their careers. After\nbeing recognized by Forbes in 2021 as one of America’s Best Employers for Diversity, Papa John’s joined Forbes’ annual list of the World’s Best\nemployers in 2022. We were honored to rank #1 amongst all pizza companies and #2 in the entire restaurant category. Also, for the second year in a row,\nwe received a score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2022 Corporate Equality Index.\nCreating an inclusive and diverse culture that supports and values team members is important to attracting and retaining talented, dedicated employees.\nWe’re implementing initiatives to diversify our workforce and leadership pipeline by attracting, recruiting, developing and supporting talent who represent\nour customers and communities, to embed policies and practices that ensure fairness, build trust and hold ourselves accountable, and to instill and reward\nbehaviors across the organization that foster belonging and increase employee engagement. We have also initiated multiple corporate initiatives over the\npast several years, including required unconscious bias training for team members, annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion training for all team members,\nthe launch of The Papa John’s Foundation for Building Community, our Day of Service with Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and the creation of eight\nglobal inclusion resource groups with leaders engaging across the organization.\nTalent Attraction, Retention and Development\nOur ability to attract and retain hourly employees in our restaurants has become more challenging, especially as the job market has become more\ncompetitive. Our goal to help all Papa John's employees succeed begins with efforts to attract and recruit a wide range of people from different\nbackgrounds, cultures, education experiences, religions and other indicators of diversity because we know a workforce that reflects the diversity of our\ncustomers and communities brings more innovative thinking and better ideas and solutions to our business. In 2022, we expanded our efforts to recruit\ndiverse talent by implementing anti-bias training for our recruiters. To meet job candidates where they live, and gain a deeper understanding of their\npersonal, educational and professional goals, we sponsor and attend job fairs, scholarship programs and university and professional organization events.\nOur recruiting strategy aims to diversify the candidate pool for all manager level and above positions. We offer our team members hiring and referral\nbonuses as well as expanded health, wellness and paid time off.\nTo help our team members succeed in their roles and to ensure consistent operational execution, we emphasize continuous training and development\nopportunities, including providing innovative tools and materials for the operational training and development of team members. Operations personnel\ncomplete our management training program and ongoing development programs, including multi-unit training, in which instruction is given on all aspects\nof our systems and operations. In addition, to further support our team members’ development, we established our Dough & Degrees program, which\nallows our team members to earn a college degree for free or at a reduced tuition in partnership with Purdue University Global and the University of\nMaryland Global Campus, among others. In 2022, we made enhancements to the program, including expanded educational offerings and less restrictive\neligibility requirements. Employees working at least ten hours per week can now obtain their High School Diplomas, learn English as a second language,\nand earn associate’s, bachelor’s and/or master’s degrees. We also offer a tuition reimbursement program that provides another opportunity for our team\nmembers to advance their careers.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOne of our core values is People First. As such, we are committed to providing competitive pay and benefits to attract and retain top talent, whether in our\nDomestic Company-owned stores, in our supply chain centers or in our corporate offices. We pay competitive wages to our front line team members in our\nDomestic Company-owned stores.\nPapa John’s offers a comprehensive benefits package to eligible team members. We also make available to our team members several benefits designed to\npromote an inclusive workplace like paid parental leave, adoption support, and health\n7\nTable of Contents\nplans that are available to dependents, spouses, and domestic partners. We offer eligible team members a 401(k) plan, with a competitive Company\nmatching component to encourage retirement savings.\nBeyond basic insurance programs, Papa John’s offers wellness services to help team members manage and optimize their health. These no-cost programs\ninclude smoking cessation, diabetes and hypertension management, weight management, and mental health support through Papa John’s employee\nassistance program for all part-time and full-time team members and their dependents. Papa John’s also makes available the “Papa Cares” program that\nprovides corporate office team members an onsite health clinic that provides a wide range of primary care services for adults, adolescents and children.\nWorkplace Health and Safety\nAs part of the Company’s enterprise-wide safety management system, we invest in training, technology and people to protect both our customers and team\nmembers. All Papa John’s team members, from those at our corporate offices to those working in our warehouses and restaurants, receive annual safety\ntraining based on the requirements of their roles. Our QC Centers and restaurant operations undergo annual safety audits, as well as random safety checks\nby regional safety managers and field safety coordinators.\nWe have also taken steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our team members and our customers by implementing extra health and\nsafety measures across our business, including No Contact Delivery and enhanced cleaning and sanitization measures.\nIndustry and Competition\nThe United States Quick Service Restaurant pizza (“QSR Pizza”) industry is mature and highly competitive with respect to price, service, location, food\nquality, customer loyalty programs and product innovation. The QSR Pizza category is largely fragmented, and competitors include a few large national\nchains and many smaller regional chains, as well as a large number of local independent pizza operators, any of which can utilize a growing number of\nfood delivery services. Some of our competitors have been in existence for substantially longer periods than Papa John’s, have substantially greater\nresources than Papa John’s and can have higher levels of restaurant penetration and stronger, more developed brand awareness in markets where we\ncompete. Competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery concepts also continues to increase.\nInternationally, the pizza delivery model is not as mature as the Domestic market and presents a growth opportunity for Papa John’s. We believe demand\nfrom international consumers will continue to increase as the demand for pizza delivery and carryout continues. We continue to execute on our growth\nstrategy and expand throughout the world.\nWith respect to the sale of franchises, we compete with many franchisors of restaurants and other business concepts. There is also active competition for\nmanagement personnel, drivers and hourly team members, and attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for Papa John’s restaurants.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe, along with our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses,\nincluding laws and regulations related to our marketing and advertising as well as the preparation and sale of food, food safety and menu labeling. Each\nPapa John’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation,\nbuilding and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, required licenses\nor approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant in a particular area. Our QC Centers are licensed and subject to regulation by state and\nlocal health and fire codes, and the operation of our trucks is subject to federal and state transportation regulations. We are also subject to federal and state\nenvironmental regulations. In addition, our Domestic operations are subject to various federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage\nrequirements, benefits, taxation, working conditions, citizenship requirements, and overtime.\nWe are subject to Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The laws of several\nstates also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise\ndisclosure document containing prescribed information. State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a significant\nnumber of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the U.S. franchisor-franchisee\nrelationship in certain respects if such bills were enacted. State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions\nand the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign\n8\nTable of Contents\ncountries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship. National, state and local\ngovernment regulations or initiatives, including health care legislation, “living wage,” or other current or proposed regulations, and increases in minimum\nwage rates affect Papa John’s as well as others within the restaurant industry. We are also subject to applicable laws in each non-US jurisdiction in which\nwe operate.\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nWe are subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally. The legal and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to\nevolve, and there has been an increase in attention given to privacy and data protection issues with the potential to impact our business. This includes\nrecently enacted laws and regulations in the United States and in other countries which require notification to individuals and government authorities of\nbreaches involving certain categories of personal information. Any changes in privacy and data protection laws or regulations could also adversely impact\nthe way we use e-mail, text messages and other marketing techniques and could require changes in our marketing strategies. We have a privacy policy\nposted on our website at www.papajohns.com. The security of our financial data, customer information and other personal information is a priority for us.\nTrademarks, Copyrights and Domain Names\nWe protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, foreign intellectual property laws,\nconfidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks,\nservice marks, domain names and copyrights. From time to time, we are made aware of the use by other persons in certain geographical areas of names and\nmarks that are the same as or substantially similar to our marks. It is our policy to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to vigorously\noppose any infringement of our marks.\nWe hold copyrights in authored works used in our business, including advertisements, packaging, training, website, and promotional materials. In addition,\nwe have registered and maintain Internet domain names, including “papajohns.com,” and country code domains patterned as “papajohns.cc,” or a close\nvariation thereof, with “.cc” representing a specific country code.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are not aware of any federal, state, local or international environmental laws or regulations that we expect to materially affect our earnings or\ncompetitive position or result in material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environment legislation or\nregulations on our operations. During 2022, we had no material environmental compliance-related capital expenditures, and no such material expenditures\nare anticipated in 2023.\nImpact of COVID-19\nPlease refer to “Recent Business Matters” within “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a\ndiscussion of recent business developments, including the impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our business and results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nAdditional Information\nAll of our periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities\nand Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are available, free of charge, through our website located at www.papajohns.com.

Risk Factors\nWe are subject to risks that could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks could cause actual\noperating results to differ from those expressed in certain “forward-looking statements” contained in this Form 10-K as well as in other Company\ncommunications. You should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all other information included in this Form 10-K and our other\npublicly filed documents.\nIndustry and Macroeconomic Risks\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have\ncontrol. An economic downturn or recession, including deterioration in the economic conditions in the U.S. or international markets where we compete, or\na slowing or stalled recovery therefrom, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including a\nreduction in the demand for our products, longer payment cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Poor economic\nconditions have in the past adversely affected and may in the future affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could also\ndisrupt our business and adversely affect our results. Higher inflation, and a related increase in costs, including rising interest rates, as well currency\nrestrictions and changes in foreign exchange rates, have impacted our franchisees and their ability to pay royalties, open new restaurants or operate existing\nrestaurants profitably. As we navigate this environment, we may need to offer support for certain franchisees in the form of royalty relief, loans or other\nsupport, close unprofitable restaurants or markets, and/or consider other alternatives such as acquiring or purchasing franchise restaurants, QC Centers or\noperations to operate them until they can be refranchised. In addition, adverse macroeconomic conditions and other business-related changes in\ncircumstances outside of our control may impact our ability to achieve our net unit development targets.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been and could continue to be adversely affected by deteriorating economic and business\nconditions in the United Kingdom. There are more than 500 franchised Papa John’s restaurants located in the United Kingdom, and we also operate an\nInternational QC Center in the United Kingdom. During 2022, our business in the United Kingdom was subject to adverse macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding high inflation, rising interest rates, an energy crisis, slowing economic growth, volatile exchange rates, and an increased VAT tax rate, which\nresulted in negative comparable sales and a challenging operating environment for our franchisees. These challenges also impacted the financial condition\nof our UK franchisees. We expect some of these conditions to continue in 2023. As we navigate this challenging economic environment, we are investing\nin capabilities to improve our operations and are working to re-position the franchise base to further strengthen our business in the United Kingdom. If our\nefforts to re-position the franchise base are unsuccessful, we might need to find new operators for certain unprofitable restaurants and/or close them, which\ncould adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operation in the region. In addition, the Company is providing financial support to\ncertain franchisees in the United Kingdom, including in the form of marketing support and loans. This franchisee support may not be sufficient to keep\nrestaurants in the United Kingdom from closing, particularly if current economic conditions worsen. The Company is unable to predict the duration or the\nextent of the macroeconomic deterioration in the United Kingdom or the extent to which franchised restaurants will be impacted.\nWe are also subject to ongoing risks and uncertainties associated with the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (referred to as “Brexit”),\nincluding implications for the free flow of labor and goods in the United Kingdom and the European Union and other financial, legal, tax and trade\nimplications.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine or other potential conflicts.\nThe global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict in Ukraine. Furthermore, governments in the United States, United Kingdom,\nand European Union have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in\nRussia. The Company has no company-owned restaurants in Russia or Ukraine and has suspended corporate support for its master franchisee in Russia,\nwhich operates and supplies all 188 franchised Papa John’s restaurants there. The Company is unable to predict how long the current environment will last\nor if it will resume corporate support to impacted franchised restaurants.\n10\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, our international business is subject to the risks of other geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including, for example, the ongoing military\nconflict between Russia and Ukraine described above, and changes in China-Taiwan and United States-China relations. We have franchised restaurants\nlocated in China and South Korea. Although we do not do business in North Korea, any future increase in tensions between South Korea and North Korea,\nsuch as an outbreak or escalation of military hostilities, or between Taiwan and China could materially adversely affect our operations in Asia or the global\neconomy, which in turn would adversely impact our business.\nOur International operations are subject to increased risks and other factors that may make it more difficult to achieve or maintain profitability or meet\nplanned growth rates.\nOur International operations could be negatively impacted by volatility and instability in international economic, political, security, or health conditions in\nthe countries in which the Company or our franchisees operate, especially in emerging markets. In addition, there are risks associated with differing\nbusiness and social cultures and consumer preferences. We may face limited availability for restaurant locations, higher location costs and difficulties in\nfranchisee selection and financing. We may be subject to difficulties in sourcing and importing high-quality ingredients (and ensuring food safety) in a cost-\neffective manner, hiring and retaining qualified team members, marketing effectively and adequately investing in information technology, especially in\nemerging markets.\nOur International operations are also subject to additional risk factors, including import and export controls, compliance with anti-corruption and other\nforeign laws, difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contract rights in foreign jurisdictions, the imposition of increased or new tariffs or trade\nbarriers and potential government seizures or nationalization. We intend to continue to expand internationally, which would make the risks related to our\nInternational operations more significant over time.\nOur International restaurants’ results, which are completely franchised, depend heavily on the operating capabilities and financial strength of our\nfranchisees. Any changes in the ability of our franchisees to run their restaurants profitably in accordance with our operating standards, or to effectively\nsub-franchise restaurants, could result in brand damage, a higher number of restaurant closures and a reduction in the number of new restaurant openings\n(which could cause us to miss our net unit development targets). For example, we currently have a large international franchisee restructuring its financing\nin Chile.\nSales made by our franchisees in international markets and certain loans we provide to such franchisees are denominated in their local currencies, and\nfluctuations in the U.S. dollar occur relative to the local currencies. Accordingly, changes in currency exchange rates will cause our revenues, investment\nincome and operating results to fluctuate. We have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Our International revenues and\nearnings may be adversely impacted as the U.S. dollar rises against foreign currencies because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars.\nAdditionally, the value of certain assets or loans denominated in local currencies may deteriorate. Other items denominated in U.S. dollars, including\nproduct imports or loans, may also become more expensive, putting pressure on franchisees’ cash flows. Our International franchisees may also be\nimpacted by currency restrictions imposed by governmental authorities, which could impact their ability to pay royalties in compliance with their franchise\nagreement. We have experienced situations with franchisees being subject to currency restrictions and unable pay royalties in U.S. dollars.\nWe are subject to risks related to epidemic and pandemic outbreaks, including COVID-19, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has had, and is continuing to have, adverse impacts on economic and market\nconditions and our business. COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in the regions in which we operate. We\nexpect that certain parts of our operations will continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of COVID-19, including resurgences and variants of the\nvirus. Our China market experienced COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. It remains\ndifficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the broader economy and how consumer behavior may change, and whether such change\nis temporary or permanent.\nThe potential adverse effects of COVID-19 or from other potential epidemics or outbreaks could also include, but may not be limited to, our ability to meet\nconsumer demand through the continued availability of our workforce and our franchisees’ workforce; other changes in labor markets affecting us, our\nfranchisees and suppliers; supply chain disruptions and increases in operating costs; adverse impacts from new laws and regulations affecting our business;\nincreased cyber risks and reliance on technology infrastructure to support our business and operations, including through remote-work protocols;\nfluctuations in foreign currency markets; credit risks of our customers and counterparties; and impairment of\n11\nTable of Contents\nlong-lived assets, the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets. However, given the evolving health, economic, social, and\ngovernmental environments, the specific impact that COVID-19 could have on these risks remains uncertain. To the extent that COVID-19 continues to\nadversely affect the U.S. and global economy, our business, financial conditions or results of operations, it may also heighten other risks described in this\nsection.\nOur profitability may suffer as a result of intense competition in our industry.\nThe QSR Pizza industry in the United States is mature and highly competitive. Competition is based on price, service, location, food quality, convenience,\nbrand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, use of technology, and the ability to identify and\nsatisfy consumer preferences. We may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures, which may\nadversely affect our profitability. When commodity and other costs increase, we may be limited in our ability to increase prices. With the significant level\nof competition and the pace of innovation, we may be required to increase investment spending in several areas, particularly marketing and technology,\nwhich can decrease profitability.\nIn addition to competition with our larger competitors, we face competition from local quick service pizza delivery restaurants and new competitors such as\nfast casual pizza concepts. We also face competitive pressures from an array of food delivery concepts and aggregators delivering for quick service or dine\nin restaurants, using new delivery technologies or delivering for competitors who previously did not have delivery capabilities, some of which may have\nmore effective marketing or delivery service capabilities. The emergence or growth of new competitors, in the pizza category or in the food service industry\ngenerally, may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our market share and could negatively impact our sales and our system-wide restaurant\noperations. We also face increasing competition from other home delivery services and grocery stores that offer an increasing variety of prepped or\nprepared meals in response to consumer demand. In addition, if our competitors respond more effectively to changes in consumer preferences or increase\ntheir market share, it could have a negative effect on our business. As a result, our sales can be directly and negatively impacted by actions of our\ncompetitors, the emergence or growth of new competitors, consumer sentiment or other factors outside our control.\nOne of our competitive strengths is our “BETTER INGREDIENTS. BETTER PIZZA.®” brand promise. This means we may use ingredients that cost more\nthan the ingredients some of our competitors may use. Because of our investment in higher-quality ingredients, we could have lower profit margins than\nsome of our competitors if we are not able to establish a quality differentiator that resonates with consumers. Our sales may be particularly impacted as\ncompetitors increasingly emphasize lower-cost menu options.\nChanges in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could adversely impact our results.\nChanges in consumer preferences and trends could negatively affect us (for example, changes in consumer perceptions of certain ingredients that could\ncause consumers to avoid pizza or some of its ingredients in favor of foods that are or are perceived as healthier, lower-calorie, or lower in carbohydrates or\notherwise based on their ingredients or nutritional content). Preferences for a dining experience such as fast casual pizza concepts could also adversely\naffect our restaurant business and reduce the effectiveness of our marketing and technology initiatives. Also, our success depends to a significant extent on\nnumerous factors affecting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer income and spending, such as general economic conditions, customer\nsentiment and employment levels. Any factors that could cause consumers to spend less on food or shift to lower-priced products could reduce sales or\ninhibit our ability to maintain or increase pricing, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nFood safety and quality concerns may negatively impact our business and profitability.\nIncidents or reports of food- or water-borne illness or other food safety issues, investigations or other actions by food safety regulators, food contamination\nor tampering, employee hygiene and cleanliness failures, improper franchisee or employee conduct, or presence of communicable disease at our restaurants\n(both Company-owned and franchised), QC Centers, or suppliers could lead to product liability or other claims. If we were to experience any such incidents\nor reports, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted. This could result in a significant decrease in customer traffic and could negatively\nimpact our revenues and profits. Similar incidents or reports occurring at quick service restaurants unrelated to us could likewise create negative publicity,\nwhich could negatively impact consumer behavior towards us.\nWe rely on our Domestic and International suppliers, as do our franchisees, to provide quality ingredients and to comply with applicable laws and industry\nstandards. A failure of one of our Domestic or International suppliers to meet our quality standards, or meet Domestic or International food industry\nstandards, could result in a disruption in our supply chain and negatively impact our brand and our results.\n12\nTable of Contents\nFailure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur results depend upon our ability to differentiate our brand and our reputation for quality. Damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact our\nbusiness and financial results. Our brand has been highly rated in past U.S. surveys, and we strive to build the value of our brand as we develop\ninternational markets.\nConsumer perceptions of our brand are affected by a variety of factors, such as the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the quality of the\ningredients we use, our marketing and advertising, our corporate culture, our policies and systems related to diversity, equity and inclusion, our business\npractices, our engagement in local communities and the manner in which we source the commodities we use.\nConsumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. Consumer perceptions may also be\naffected by third parties, including current or former spokespersons, employees and executives, presenting or promoting adverse commentary or portrayals\nof our industry, our brand, our suppliers or our franchisees, or otherwise making statements, disclosing information or taking actions that could damage our\nreputation. If we are unsuccessful in managing incidents that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents receive considerable\npublicity or result in litigation, our brand value and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media, influencers, and/or shareholder activism\ncould adversely impact our business.\nIn recent years, there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, chat platforms, social media websites, and other\nforms of internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other persons. The popularity of social media\nand other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination, and could hamper our ability to promptly\ncorrect misrepresentations or otherwise respond effectively to negative publicity, whether or not accurate. The dissemination of proprietary Company or\nnegative information, whether or not accurate, by customers, employees, social media influencers, and others via social media could harm our business,\nbrand, reputation, marketing partners, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information’s accuracy.\nIn addition, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers and the public in general. Failure to use social media effectively could lead to\na decline in brand value and revenue. Other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative\ncomments about our brand, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information.\nWe are also subject to the risk of negative publicity associated with various shareholder proposals, campaigns, and activism, including publicity related to\nthe environment, animal welfare, diversity, responsible sourcing, and other Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) topics. Despite our best efforts\nrelating to ESG policies, initiatives and reporting, media reports and social media campaigns can create a negative opinion or perception of the company’s\nefforts. Such media reports and negative publicity could impact customer or investor perception of our Company or industry and can have a material\nadverse effect on our financial results.\nIn addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of our ESG initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data,\nprocesses and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our goals within the scope of ESG on a timely basis,\nor at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.\nOur franchise business model presents a number of risks.\nOur success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence over their operations. Our\nfranchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants and compliance with\napplicable laws. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to maintain or grow their sales.\nIf our franchisees do not maintain or grow sales, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees,\nespecially in emerging markets and/or high-cost markets, their financial results may deteriorate, which in the past has resulted in, and could in the future\nresult in, among other things, required financial support from us, higher numbers of restaurant closures (which could cause us to miss our net unit\ndevelopment targets), reduced numbers of restaurant openings, franchisee bankruptcies or restructuring activities, delayed or reduced payments to us, or\nincreased franchisee assistance, which reduces our revenues.\n13\nTable of Contents\nOur success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our franchisees to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and marketing\nplans. Franchisees’ ability to continue to grow is also dependent in large part on the availability of franchisee funding at reasonable interest rates and may\nbe negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees. Our operating performance could also be\nnegatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety, compliance, or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and\nvalues, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation. If franchisees do not\nsuccessfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards or applicable laws, the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed,\nwhich in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\nWe may be adversely impacted by increases in the cost of food ingredients and other costs.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in prices of commodities. An increase in the cost or sustained high levels of the cost of cheese or other commodities could\nadversely affect the profitability of our system-wide restaurant operations, particularly if we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to offset\nincreased costs. We have recently experienced significant inflation in commodities prices, including food ingredients, which has significantly increased our\noperating expenses. Cheese, representing our largest food cost, and other commodities can be subject to significant cost fluctuations due to weather,\navailability, global demand and other factors that are beyond our control. Additionally, increases in labor, mileage, insurance, fuel, and other costs could\nadversely affect the profitability of our restaurant and QC Center businesses. Many of the factors affecting costs in our system-wide restaurant operations\nare beyond our control, and we may not be able to adequately mitigate these costs or pass along these costs to our customers or franchisees, given the\nsignificant competitive pricing pressures we face.\nChanges in privacy or data protection laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email, text messages, social media and postal mailings. Any future restrictions in federal,\nstate or foreign laws regarding marketing and solicitation or Domestic or International data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely\naffect the continuing effectiveness of email, text messages, social media and postal mailing techniques and could force changes in our marketing strategies.\nIf this occurs, we may need to develop alternative marketing strategies, which may not be as effective and could impact the amount and timing of our\nrevenues.\nHigher labor costs, increased competition for qualified team members and ensuring adequate staffing in our restaurants and QC Centers increase the cost\nof doing business. Additionally, changes in employment and labor laws, including health care legislation and minimum wage increases, could increase\ncosts for our system-wide operations.\nOur success depends in part on our and our franchisees’ ability to recruit, motivate, train and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an\nintensely competitive environment. We and our franchisees have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for restaurant positions\ndue to job market trends and conditions, which could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions. Our ability to attract and retain\nhourly employees in our restaurants has been impacted by these trends and conditions, and we expect staffing and labor challenges to continue into 2023.\nIncreased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in Company-owned and franchised restaurants have had,\nand may in the future have, a negative impact on our Company-owned restaurant margins and the margins of franchised restaurants. Competition for\nqualified drivers for both our restaurants and supply-chain function also continues to increase as more companies compete for drivers or enter the delivery\nspace, including third party aggregators. Additionally, economic actions, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations,\ncould adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers. Social media may be used to foster negative\nperceptions of employment with our Company in particular or in our industry generally, and to promote strikes or boycotts.\nWe are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime compensation, benefits, working\nconditions, citizenship requirements and discrimination and family and medical leave and employee related litigation. Labor costs and labor-related\nbenefits are primary components in the cost of operation of our restaurants and QC Centers. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care\nmandates could increase our system-wide labor costs.\nA significant number of hourly personnel are paid at rates at or above the federal and state minimum wage requirements. Accordingly, the enactment of\nadditional state or local minimum wage increases above federal wage rates or regulations related to exempt employees has increased and could continue to\nincrease labor costs for our Domestic system-wide\n14\nTable of Contents\noperations. A significant increase in the federal minimum wage requirement could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, while we do not currently have a unionized workforce, certain employees of other companies in our industry have recently become unionized.\nIf a significant portion of our corporate or franchisee’s workforce were to become unionized, labor costs could increase and our business could be\nnegatively affected by union requirements that increase costs, disrupt business, reduce flexibility and affect the employer-employee relationship. Further,\ncorporate or franchisees’ response to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived.\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to invest in or adapt to technological\ndevelopments or industry trends could harm our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including digital ordering solutions, through which a majority of our Domestic sales originate. We also rely\nheavily on point-of-sale processing in our Company-owned and franchised restaurants for data collection and payment systems for the collection of cash,\ncredit and debit card transactions, and other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends on the\nreliability and capacity of these technology systems. In addition, we anticipate that consumers will continue to have more options to place orders digitally,\nboth domestically and internationally. We plan to continue to invest in enhancing and improving the functionality and features of our information\ntechnology systems. However, we cannot ensure that our initiatives will be beneficial to the extent, or within the timeframes, expected or that the estimated\nimprovements will be realized as anticipated or at all. Our failure to adequately invest in new technology and adapt to technological developments and\nindustry trends, particularly our digital ordering capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share. Notwithstanding adequate\ninvestment in new technology, our marketing and technology initiatives may not be successful in improving our comparable sales results. Additionally, we\nare in an environment where the technology life cycle is short and consumer technology demands are high, which requires continued reinvestment in\ntechnology that will increase the cost of doing business and will increase the risk that our technology may not be customer-centric or could become\nobsolete, inefficient or otherwise incompatible with other systems.\nWe rely on our International franchisees to maintain their own point-of-sale and online ordering systems, which are often purchased from third-party\nvendors, potentially exposing International franchisees to more operational risk, including cyber and data privacy risks and governmental regulation\ncompliance risks.\nCompany Risks\nOur reorganization activities may increase our expenses, may not be successful, and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention.\nWe opened an office in Atlanta, Georgia in October 2021 and in February 2023, we announced a plan to sell our office building and campus in Louisville\nand move the office to a new location in Louisville. These plans could also impact the existing location of our QC Center in Louisville. As a result, we\nhave incurred and will incur certain non-recurring corporate reorganization costs, and these expenses have impacted and could adversely impact our results\nof operations during the relevant period, reduce our cash position and/or result in an impairment risk related to these assets. Additionally, our ability to\nachieve the anticipated benefits of our corporate reorganization are subject to assumptions and uncertainties. If we do not realize the anticipated benefits\nfrom these measures, or if we incur costs greater than anticipated, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, turnover in our Atlanta, Louisville and Milton Keynes, UK, corporate office support teams could distract our employees, decrease employee\nmorale, harm our reputation, and negatively impact the overall performance of our corporate support teams. As a result of these or other similar risks, our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to effectively market our products or maintain key marketing partnerships.\nThe success of our business depends on the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional plans. We may not be able to effectively execute our national or\nlocal marketing plans, particularly if we experienced lower sales that would result in reduced levels of marketing funds. In addition, our financial results\nmay be harmed if our marketing, advertising, and promotional programs are less effective than those of our competitors, who may have greater resources\nwhich enable them to invest more than us in advertising. We may be required to expend additional funds to effectively improve consumer sentiment and\nsales, and we may also be required to engage in additional activities to retain customers or attract new\n15\nTable of Contents\ncustomers to the brand. Such marketing expenses and promotional activities, which could include discounting our products, could adversely impact our\nresults.\nSpokespersons or marketing partners who endorse our products could take actions that harm their reputations, which could also cause harm to our brand.\nFrom time to time, in response to changes in the business environment and the audience share of marketing channels, we expect to reallocate marketing\nresources across social media and other channels. That reallocation may not be effective or as successful as the marketing and advertising allocations of our\ncompetitors, which could negatively impact the amount and timing of our revenues.\nWe may not be able to execute our strategy or achieve our planned growth targets, which could negatively impact our business and our financial results.\nOur growth strategy depends on our and our franchisees’ ability to open new restaurants and to operate them on a profitable basis. We expect substantially\nall of our International unit growth and much of our Domestic unit growth to be franchised units. Accordingly, our profitability increasingly depends upon\nroyalty revenues from franchisees. If our franchisees are not able to operate their businesses successfully under our franchised business model, our results\ncould suffer. Additionally, we may fail to attract new qualified franchisees or existing franchisees may close underperforming locations. Planned growth\ntargets and the ability to operate new and existing restaurants profitably are affected by economic, regulatory and competitive conditions and consumer\nbuying habits. A decrease in sales, or increased commodity or operating costs, including, but not limited to, employee compensation and benefits or\ninsurance costs, could slow the rate of new store openings or increase the number of store closings. Our business is susceptible to adverse changes in local,\nnational and global economic conditions, which could make it difficult for us to meet our growth targets. Additionally, we or our franchisees may face\nchallenges securing financing, finding suitable store locations at acceptable terms or securing required Domestic or foreign government permits and\napprovals. Declines in comparable sales, net store openings and related operating profits can impact our stock price. If we do not continue to grow future\nsales and operating results and meet our related growth targets or external expectations for net restaurant openings or our other strategic objectives in the\nfuture, our stock price could decline.\nOur franchisees remain dependent on the availability of financing to remodel or renovate existing locations, upgrade systems and enhance technology, or\nconstruct and open new restaurants. From time to time, the Company may provide financing to certain franchisees and prospective franchisees in order to\nmitigate store closings, allow new units to open, or complete required upgrades. If we are unable or unwilling to provide such financing, which is a\nfunction of, among other things, prevailing interest rates and a franchisee’s creditworthiness, the number of new restaurant openings may be slower or the\nrate of closures may be higher than expected and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. To the extent we provide financing to franchisees,\nour results could be negatively impacted by negative performance of these franchisee loans.\nOur dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers for some ingredients and other supplies could result in disruptions to our business.\nDomestic restaurants purchase substantially all food and related products from our QC Centers. We are dependent on Leprino Foods Dairy Products\nCompany (“Leprino”) as our sole supplier for mozzarella cheese, one of our key ingredients. Leprino, one of the major pizza category suppliers of cheese\nin the United States, currently supplies all of our mozzarella cheese domestically and substantially all of our mozzarella cheese internationally. We also\ndepend on a sole source for our supply of certain desserts and garlic sauce, which constitute less than 10% of our Domestic Company-owned restaurant\nsales. While we have no other sole sources of supply for key ingredients or menu items, we do source other key ingredients from a limited number of\nsuppliers. While we strive to engage in a competitive bidding process for our ingredients, because certain of these ingredients, including meat products,\nmay only be available from a limited number of vendors, we may not always be able to do so effectively. We may be subject to interruptions in supply or\nshortages of these items due to factors beyond our control or issues with our suppliers from time to time. Alternative sources of mozzarella cheese, desserts,\nother key ingredients or menu items may not be available on a timely basis or may not be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current\narrangements.\nIncrease in ingredient and other operating costs, including those caused by weather, climate change, COVID-19 and food safety, could adversely affect our\nresults of operations.\nOur Company-owned and franchised restaurants could also be harmed by supply chain interruptions including those caused by factors beyond our control\nor the control of our suppliers. However, prolonged disruption in the supply of products from or to our QC Centers due to weather, climate change, natural\ndisasters, COVID-19, crop disease, food safety incidents, regulatory compliance, labor dispute or interruption of service by carriers could increase costs,\nlimit the availability of\n16\nTable of Contents\ningredients critical to our restaurant operations and have a significant impact on results. Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in global\nweather patterns, including related to global climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients, energy\nand other materials throughout our supply chain. In particular, adverse weather or crop disease affecting the California tomato crop could disrupt the supply\nof pizza sauce to our and our franchisees’ restaurants. Insolvency of key suppliers could also cause similar business interruptions and negatively impact our\nbusiness.\nWe rely on third parties for certain business processes and services, and failure or inability of such third-party vendors to perform subjects us to risks,\nincluding business disruption and increased costs.\nWe depend on the performance of suppliers, aggregators and other third parties in our business operations. Third-party business processes we utilize\ninclude information technology, gift card authorization and processing, other payment processing, benefits, and other accounting and business services. We\nconduct third-party due diligence and seek to obtain contractual assurance that our vendors will maintain adequate controls, such as adequate security\nagainst data breaches. However, the failure of our suppliers to maintain adequate controls or comply with our expectations and standards could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nChanges in purchasing practices by our Domestic franchisees, or prolonged disruptions in our QC Center operations, could harm our commissary\nbusiness.\nAlthough our Domestic franchisees currently purchase substantially all food products from our QC Centers, the only required QC Center purchases by\nfranchisees are pizza sauce, dough and other items we may designate as proprietary or integral to our system. Any changes in purchasing practices by\nDomestic franchisees, such as seeking alternative approved suppliers of ingredients or other food products, could adversely affect the financial results of\nour QC Centers and the Company. In addition, any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our QC facilities, whether due to technical, systems,\noperational or labor difficulties, destruction or damage to the facility, real estate issues, limited capacity or other reasons, could adversely affect our\nbusiness and operating results.\nOur current insurance may not be adequate and we may experience claims in excess of our reserves.\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability, property, and health insurance coverage provided\nto our employees are funded by the Company up to certain retention levels under our retention programs. Retention limits generally range up to $0.5\nmillion. These insurance programs may not be adequate to protect us, and it may be difficult or impossible to obtain additional coverage or maintain current\ncoverage at a reasonable cost. We also have experienced claims volatility and high costs for our insurance programs. We estimate loss reserves based on\nhistorical trends, actuarial assumptions and other data available to us, but we may not be able to accurately estimate reserves. If we experience claims in\nexcess of our projections, our business could be negatively impacted. Our franchisees could be similarly impacted by higher claims experience, hurting\nboth their operating results and/or limiting their ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have incurred substantial debt obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition, and we may be able to incur substantially more\nindebtedness, including secured debt, and take other actions that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness or affect\nour ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nOur outstanding debt as of December 25, 2022 was $605.0 million, which was comprised of $400.0 million outstanding under our 3.875% senior notes due\n2029 (the “Notes”) and $205.0 million under our revolving credit facility (the “PJI Revolving Facility”) that forms part of our amended and restated credit\nagreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”). We had approximately $395.0 million of remaining availability under the PJI Revolving Facility as of\nDecember 25, 2022.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of\nour cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n• increase our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate,\nregulatory and economic conditions;\n• expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement will be subject to variable rates of interest;\n17\nTable of Contents\n• increase our vulnerability to a downgrade of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital\nmarkets;\n• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n• limit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nWe expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations. Our ability to meet our\nexpenses and to pay principal of and interest on our indebtedness when due thus depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial,\nbusiness, economic and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate\nand pressure from competitors.\nIn addition, subject to restrictions in the agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more\nindebtedness in the future, resulting in higher leverage. The Indenture and the Amended Credit Agreement allow us to incur additional indebtedness,\nincluding secured debt. Such additional indebtedness may be substantial. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other\nactions that are not prohibited by the Indenture or the Amended Credit Agreement could have the effect of exacerbating the risks associated with our\nsubstantial indebtedness or diminishing our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to\nfund acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, other growth opportunities and other general corporate purposes.\nThe agreements governing our debt, including the Indenture governing our Notes and the Amended Credit Agreement, contain various covenants that\nimpose restrictions on us.\nThe Indenture and the Amended Credit Agreement impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. In particular, such agreements limit or\nprohibit our ability to, among other things:\n• incur additional indebtedness;\n• make certain investments;\n• sell assets, including capital stock of certain subsidiaries;\n• declare or pay dividends, repurchase or redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;\n• consolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve;\n• enter into transactions with our affiliates; and\n• incur liens.\nIn addition, our Amended Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with specified leverage ratios under certain circumstances. Our ability to\ncomply with these provisions may be affected by our business performance or events beyond our control, and these provisions could limit our ability to\nplan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise conduct our business activities and plans.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of\nfinancing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities.\nFurthermore, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any\nof the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing\ncross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, and could increase the costs of availability of credit for us. Such a default would permit lenders to accelerate\nthe maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have\nsufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur\nadditional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted\nwaivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt\non terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe are exposed to variable interest rates under our Amended Credit Agreement, and increases in interest rates would also increase our debt service costs\nand could materially impact our profitability.\nWe are exposed to variable interest rates under the Amended Credit Agreement. We have entered into interest rate swaps that fix a portion of our variable\ninterest rate risk. However, by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we also expose ourselves to credit risk. Credit\nrisk is due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.\n18\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risks\nNatural disasters, hostilities, social unrest, severe weather and other catastrophic events may disrupt our operations or supply chain.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster, hostilities, cyber-attack, social unrest, terrorist activity, outbreak of epidemic, pandemic or other contagious disease,\npower outages, severe weather (such as tornados, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, heat waves, etc.) or other catastrophic events may disrupt our\noperations or supply chain and result in the closure of our restaurants (Company-owned or franchised), our corporate offices, any of our QC Centers or the\nfacilities of our suppliers, and can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence levels and supply availability and costs, any of which could\nmaterially adversely affect our results of operations.\nClimate change may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe operate in 48 countries globally and recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, as we noted\nabove, the supply and price of our food ingredients can be affected by multiple factors, such as weather and water supply quality and availability, which\nfactors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change. While we believe this geographic diversity is likely to lessen the impact of individual climate\nchange related events on our financial results, our restaurants and operations may nonetheless be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which\nare predicted to increase the frequency and severity of weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts. Such events have the\npotential to disrupt our and our franchisees’ operations, cause store closures, disrupt the business of our third-party suppliers and impact our customers, all\nof which may cause us to suffer losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\nIncreasingly complex laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in an increasingly complex regulatory environment, and the cost of regulatory compliance is increasing. Our failure, or the failure of any of our\nfranchisees, to comply with applicable U.S. and international labor, health care, food, health and safety, consumer protection, franchise, anti-bribery and\ncorruption, competition, environmental, and other laws may result in civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties. Enforcement of existing laws\nand regulations, changes in legal requirements, and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs\nand create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Increased regulatory\nscrutiny of food matters, online advertising, product marketing claims, and increased litigation and enforcement actions may increase compliance and legal\ncosts and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Governments may also impose\nrequirements and restrictions that impact our business. For example, some local government agencies have implemented ordinances that restrict the sale of\ncertain food and drink products, or the type of packaging and utensils that may be used.\nCompliance with new or additional Domestic and International government laws or regulations, including the European Union General Data Protection\nRegulation (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), and several other data privacy and\nbiometric laws adopted by U.S. states, which could increase costs for compliance. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number,\nchange frequently and increasingly conflict among the various states and countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and\ncosts. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, it could damage our brand and subject the Company to reputational damage, significant litigation,\nmonetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in various jurisdictions. For example, a failure to comply with the GDPR could result in fines\nup to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues.\nThere also has been increased stakeholder focus, including by US and foreign governmental authorities, investors, media and nongovernmental\norganizations, on environmental sustainability matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. Legislative,\nregulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in taxes, restrictions on or increases in\nthe costs of supplies, transportation and utilities, any of which could increase our operating costs and those of our franchisees, and necessitate future\ninvestments in facilities and equipment. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish additional goals to\ntake actions to meet them, which could expose us and our franchisees to market, operational, execution and reputational costs or risks. These initiatives or\ngoals could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a\nsufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of any disclosure.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the changing rules and regulations related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters imposed by governmental and self-\nregulatory organizations such as the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, a variety of third-party organizations and institutional investors evaluate the\nperformance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder\nexpectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and\nattention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress\nagainst those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and\nassumptions that are subject to change in the future.\nDisruptions of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to compete and conduct our business.\nOur critical business and information technology systems have in the past and could in the future be damaged or interrupted by power loss, various\ntechnological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks, ransomware sabotage or acts of God. In particular, the Company and our franchisees have experienced\noccasional interruptions of our digital ordering solutions, which make online ordering unavailable or slow to respond, negatively impacting sales and the\nexperience of our customers. If our digital ordering solutions do not perform with adequate speed and security, our customers may be less inclined to return\nto our digital ordering solutions.\nPart of our technology infrastructure, such as our Domestic point-of-sale system, is specifically designed for us and our operational systems, which could\ncause unexpected costs, delays or inefficiencies when infrastructure upgrades are needed or prolonged and widespread technological difficulties occur.\nSignificant portions of our technology infrastructure, particularly in our digital ordering solutions, are provided by third parties, and the performance of\nthese systems is largely beyond our control. Occasionally, we have experienced or could experience temporary disruptions in our business due to third-\nparty systems failing to adequately perform. Failure to manage future failures of these systems, particularly as our online sales grow, could harm our\nbusiness and the satisfaction of our customers. Such third-party systems could be disrupted either through system failure or if third party vendor patents and\ncontractual agreements do not afford us protection against similar technology. In addition, we may not have or be able to obtain adequate protection or\ninsurance to mitigate the risks of these events or compensate for losses related to these events, which could damage our business and reputation and be\nexpensive and difficult to remedy or repair.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in damage to our reputation, loss of sales, and/or subject us to litigation,\npenalties or significant costs.\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations. We collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data,\nincluding credit card data and other personally identifiable information of our employees and customers housed in the various information systems we use.\nConstantly changing information security threats, particularly persistent cyber security threats, pose risks to the security of our systems and networks, and\nthe confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and the availability and integrity of our critical business functions. As techniques used in cyber-\nattacks evolve, we may not be able to timely detect threats or anticipate and implement adequate security measures. The integrity and protection of the\ncustomer, employee, franchisee and Company data are critical to us. Our information technology systems and databases, and those provided by our third-\nparty vendors, including international vendors, have been and will continue to be subject to computer viruses, malware attacks, unauthorized user attempts,\nphishing and denial of service and other malicious cyber-attacks. The failure to prevent fraud or security breaches or to adequately invest in data security\ncould harm our business and revenues due to the reputational damage to our brand. Such a breach could also result in litigation, regulatory actions,\npenalties, and other significant costs to us and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. These costs could be significant and well in excess of,\nor not covered by, our cyber insurance coverage.\nWe have been and will continue to be subject to various types of investigations and litigation, including collective and class action litigation, which could\nsubject us to significant damages or other remedies.\nWe are subject to the risk of investigations and litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, franchisees, state and federal agencies,\nstockholders and employees. From time to time, we are involved in a number of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings consisting of securities,\nantitrust, intellectual property, employment, consumer, personal injury, corporate governance, commercial and other matters arising in the ordinary course\nof business.\nWe have been subject to claims in cases containing collective and class action allegations. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very\nlarge or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated.\nLitigation trends involving personal injury, employment\n20\nTable of Contents\nlaw, intellectual property, data privacy, and the relationship between franchisors and franchisees may increase our cost of doing business. We evaluate all of\nthe claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the amount of potential losses to us. In many\ncases, particularly collective and class action cases, we may not be able to estimate the amount of potential losses and/or our estimates may prove to be\ninsufficient. These assessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of\njudgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held\nliable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact earnings. Further, we may not\nbe able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.\nWe may be subject to harassment or discrimination claims and legal proceedings. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct policies prohibit harassment\nand discrimination in the workplace, in sexual or in any other form. To monitor and enforce these policies, we have ongoing programs for workplace\ntraining and compliance, and we investigate and take disciplinary action with respect to alleged violations. Nevertheless, actions by our team members\ncould violate those policies. Franchisees and suppliers are also required to comply with all applicable laws and govern themselves with integrity. Any\nviolations (or perceptions thereof) by our franchisees or suppliers could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business and create\nreputational or other harm to the Company.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on the Papa John’s brand name and rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property rights to\nprotect and promote our brand. We believe the success of our business depends on our continued ability to exclusively use our existing marks to increase\nbrand awareness and further develop our brand, both domestically and abroad. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights,\nand we may be required to pursue litigation to prevent consumer confusion and preserve our brand’s high-quality reputation. Litigation could result in high\ncosts and diversion of resources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, regardless of the outcome.\nWe may be subject to impairment charges.\nImpairment charges are possible due to the nature and timing of decisions we make about underperforming assets or markets, or if previously opened or\nacquired restaurants perform below our expectations. This could result in a decrease in our reported asset value and reduction in our net income.\nWe operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results.\nWe operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. We have international operations and generate substantial revenues and\nprofits in foreign jurisdictions. The Domestic and International tax environments continue to evolve as a result of tax changes in various jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate and changes in the tax laws in certain countries, including the United States, could impact our future operating results. A significant\nincrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate could negatively impact our financial results.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 2.

The initial term of most Domestic restaurant leases is five years with most\nleases providing for one or more options to renew for at least one additional term. Generally, the leases are triple net leases, which require us to pay all or a\nportion of the cost of insurance, taxes and utilities. As a result of assigning our interest in obligations under property leases as a condition of the\nrefranchising of certain restaurants, we are also contingently liable for payment of approximately 53 Domestic leases.\nOur corporate office in Atlanta, Georgia, is located in a leased space. Nine of our 12 North America QC Centers are located in leased spaces, with the\nremaining three QC Centers located in buildings we own. Our corporate office and our printing operations located in Louisville, KY are in buildings owned\nby us. We also maintain a Company-owned office and a full-service QC Center outside of London, UK, where our International operations are managed.\nAt December 25, 2022, we leased and subleased approximately 442 Papa John’s restaurant sites to franchisees in the UK. The initial lease terms on the\nfranchised sites in the UK are generally 15 years. The Company has the option to negotiate an extension toward the end of the lease term at the landlord’s\ndiscretion. The initial lease terms of the franchisee subleases are generally five to ten years. See “Note 3. Leases” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements” for additional information.\nItem 3.

However, there are significantly more beneficial owners of our common stock than there are record\nholders.\nOn January 26, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2023 dividend of $0.42 per common share. The dividend was paid on February 17,\n2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 6, 2023.\nWe anticipate continuing the payment of quarterly cash dividends. The actual amount of such dividends is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors\nand will depend upon future earnings, results of operations, capital requirements, our financial condition, contractual restrictions, including the terms of the\nagreements governing our debt and any future indebtedness we may incur and other relevant factors. There can be no assurance that the Company will\ncontinue to pay quarterly cash dividends at the current rate or at all.\nOn October 28, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with an indefinite duration for up to $425.0 million of the Company’s\ncommon stock. This share repurchase program operated alongside our previous $75.0 million share repurchase authorization, which began on November 4,\n2020 and expired on December 26, 2021. In fiscal 2022, approximately 1,343,000 shares with an aggregate cost of $125.0 million and an average price of\n$93.07 per share were repurchased under our share repurchase program. Funding for the share repurchase program was provided through our operating\ncash flows and our $600.0 million PJI Revolving Facility.\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase activity by fiscal period during the fourth quarter ended December 25, 2022 (in thousands, except per share\namounts):\nTotal Number Maximum Dollar\nTotal Average of Shares Purchas ed Value of Shares\nNumbe r Price as Part of Publicly that May Yet Be\nof Shares Paid pe r Announced Plans Purchased Under t he\nFiscal Period Purchased Share or Programs Plans or Programs\n9/26/2022 - 10/23/2022 — $ — — $ 329,800\n10/24/2022 - 11/20/2022 88 82.51 88 322,559\n11/21/2022 - 12/25/2022 273 83.34 273 299,800\nTotal 361 $ 83.14 361 $ 299,800\nSubsequent to year-end, we acquired an additional 319,307 shares at an aggregate cost of $27.6 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction and Overview\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data and the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThis section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between the years ended\nDecember 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021. Discussion of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between the years ended December 26, 2021 and\nDecember 27, 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2021.\nPapa John’s International, Inc. (referred to as the “Company,” “Papa John’s,” “Papa Johns” or in the first-person notations of “we,” “us” and “our”) began\noperations in 1984. At December 25, 2022, there were 5,706 Papa John’s restaurants in operation, consisting of 522 Company-owned and 5,184 franchised\nrestaurants. Our revenues are derived from retail sales of pizza and other food and beverage products to the general public by Company-owned restaurants,\nfranchise royalties, and sales of franchise and development rights. Additionally, approximately 48% to 52% of our North America revenues in each of the\nlast two fiscal years were derived from sales to franchisees of various items including food and paper products from our Domestic Quality Control Centers\n(“QC Centers”), operation of our International QC Center in the UK, contributions received by Papa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”) which is our\nnational marketing fund, printing and promotional items and information systems equipment, and software and related services. We believe that in addition\nto supporting both Company and franchised profitability and growth, these activities contribute to product quality and consistency throughout the Papa\nJohn’s system.\nRecent Business Matters\nIn 2022, the Company focused on executing strategic priorities and building a foundation for long-term success, while navigating a challenging\nmacroeconomic environment. Our progress and significant transactions during the year are described below.\nGrowth Strategy. The Company delivered its fourteenth consecutive quarter of Global system-wide restaurant sales growth and continues to expand both\ndomestically and internationally, as evidenced by our comparable sales and restaurant unit growth.\nOur menu and digital innovations are an important part of our long-term strategy to drive new customers and ticket sales. We focus our menu innovations\non products that add both value and variety for our customers but do not add complexity to our restaurant operations or to our supply chain. Our menu\ninnovation calendar is expansive, flexible and differentiated and allows us to adjust our offerings depending on what customers want – whether that is\nextending a Limited-Time-Offer or building upon existing platforms. We believe our digital innovations, like our website, digital app, third-party\naggregator partnerships and Papa Call call centers are a differentiator for our customers and provide attractive channels that promote customer retention\nand help us grow our customer base. In 2022, approximately 85% of our Domestic transactions came through these digital channels.\nOur expanding development pipeline is also a key long-term growth driver as there remains significant opportunity to offer our differentiated, premium\nposition to more customers globally and domestically. In 2022, we expanded our global footprint by 4.5%, with 244 net new units (excluding the 188\nrestaurants suspended in Russia in the first quarter of 2022 and discussed below). We expect this growth to accelerate in 2023 with global development to\nbe between 270 to 310 net new units. Our view of our long-term unit opportunity, both domestically and internationally, continues to expand as we sign\nhistoric deals to develop within key areas. In 2022, we announced that we expect 1,400 to 1,800 net new Papa Johns restaurants worldwide from 2022\nthrough the end of 2025. We plan to continue focusing on our strategic innovative products and restaurant development across our platforms to drive\nsustainable growth this year and beyond.\nGlobal Market Conditions. The differentiated brand positioning of Papa Johns and the agility of our business model have been critical to our success as we\nhave had to navigate a constantly changing environment in recent years. Our brand positioning and ability to adapt are no less important today as we\ncontinue to adjust to a more inflationary and uncertain environment and consumers are increasingly seeking out value. As consumer demand for dining has\nsoftened over the past year, pizza offers tremendous value relative to other quick service restaurants. Using Papa Rewards, our loyalty program, we are able\nto target more price-sensitive customers with high-value promotions. At the same time, we have continued our\n28\nTable of Contents\nsuccessful strategy of letting our customers, especially those who are less price sensitive, self-select into our premium priced menu innovations. While we\nhave increased pricing in response to inflation, partially offsetting higher food, labor and fuel costs in our supply chain and at our restaurants, our ticket\ngrowth has predominantly come through new premium products and add-ons over the past few years.\nMacroeconomic conditions in the United Kingdom, the largest region in our International segment, have declined in light of ongoing inflation, rising\ninterest rates and the recent energy crisis. Against this backdrop, the Company has experienced increasing declines in sales and profitability in the UK\nmarket. While uncertain how long these conditions will last, the Company is committed to its presence in the UK and is invested in the Company’s long-\nterm success in this region. As we navigate this challenging economic environment, we will be investing in capabilities to improve our operations and will\nwork to re-position the franchise base to further strengthen our UK business. The next step in our commitment includes a variety of support to help\nfranchisees through this difficult time, including targeted marketing incentives of approximately $2 million to $3 million.\nRefranchising. On March 28, 2022, the Company sold its 51 percent controlling interest in a joint venture between Papa Johns and Blue and Silver\nVentures, Ltd. (“Blue and Silver Ventures”). Sun Holdings, Inc. (“Sun Holdings”), a leading multi-brand franchisee operator and one of Papa John’s largest\nDomestic franchise partners, assumed control of the 90 Papa John’s restaurants in Texas that operated under the joint venture. By strategically refranchising\nits controlling interests in its joint venture with Blue and Silver Ventures to Sun Holdings, the Company provided Sun Holdings substantial scale to support\nnew restaurant openings under its current, 100-restaurant development agreement with the Company. This commitment is in addition to the 90 refranchised\nrestaurants. As a result, the deal is expected to accelerate the Company’s Domestic development, contributing to long-term earnings via high-margin\nfranchise royalty growth. The restaurants were consolidated in the Company’s results through the date of the transaction, and their results are included in\nthe Company’s North America franchise royalties and fees beginning March 29, 2022. See “Note 22. Divestitures” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for further information.\nSuspension of Franchisee Support in Russia. The Company has no Company-owned restaurants in Russia or Ukraine. At the end of fiscal year 2021, 188\nfranchised restaurants were located in Russia, all of which were operated and supplied through a master franchisee. As of March 2022, Papa John’s\nsuspended its corporate operations and support for franchised restaurants in Russia, and fully reserved all receivables from the aforementioned master\nfranchisee. The Company recognized $17.4 million in one-time, non-cash charges related to reserves for certain loans and impairments of reacquired\nfranchised rights due to the conflict in Ukraine and subsequent international government actions and sanctions, which were recorded as Refranchising and\nimpairment loss of $2.8 million and General and administrative expenses of $14.6 million. All assets related to the franchised operations in Russia have\nbeen fully reserved or impaired, so there are no additional Russia related charges for reserves, write-offs, or impairments of amounts recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nCoronavirus Pandemic and Related Market Impact. The restaurant industry has faced and managed staffing challenges since long before the pandemic.\nThese challenges intensified with the increased demand for employees in the service industry as the economy recovered last year. In early 2022, the\nOmicron variant further exacerbated the situation, given the spike in infection rates and number of people out sick or quarantined at home. Our team\nmembers have been working harder than ever to continue to safely serve their customers and communities and we have benefited from their dedication to\nmanage through staffing constraints. We will continue to strive to be the employer of choice in our industry and have taken many actions to create a strong\nculture and support our people.\nPresentation of Financial Results\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to select accounting policies for\ncritical accounting areas as well as estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s\nsignificant accounting policies, including recently issued accounting pronouncements, are more fully described in “Note 2. Significant Accounting\nPolicies” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” A number of our significant accounting policies are critical due to the fact that they involve a\nsignificant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations. Significant changes in assumptions and/or conditions in our critical accounting policies could materially impact the operating results.\n29\nTable of Contents\nInsurance Reserves\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability and property insurance coverage are funded by\nthe Company up to certain retention levels. Retention limits range up to $0.5 million. We record the liability for losses based upon undiscounted estimates\nof the liability for claims incurred and for events that have occurred but have not been reported using certain third-party actuarial projections and our\nhistorical claims loss experience.\nAs of December 25, 2022, our insurance reserves were $67.3 million compared to $88.1 million at December 26, 2021. Reserves are included in Accrued\nexpenses and other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our insurance reserves primarily relate to auto\nliability and workers’ compensation claims and include the gross up of claims above our retention levels, with a corresponding receivable recorded in\nPrepaid and other current assets and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The insurance reserves represent the mid-point of the range as\ndetermined by our actuarial analysis, which considered various actuarial valuation methodologies. The determination of the recorded insurance reserves is\nhighly complex due to the significant uncertainty in the potential value of reported claims and the number and potential value of incurred but not reported\nclaims.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Franchisee Notes Receivable\nThe Company has provided financing (recorded as notes receivable) to select Domestic and International franchisees principally for use in the construction\nand development of their restaurants and for the purchase of restaurants from the Company or other franchisees. Most notes receivable bear interest at fixed\nor floating rates and are generally secured by the assets of each restaurant and the ownership interests in the franchise. The Company has also provided\nlong-term financing to certain franchisees with royalty payment plans.\nThe Company establishes an allowance for credit losses on franchisee notes receivables based on management’s estimate of the lifetime expected loss on\nthe notes. The allowance for credit losses on notes receivable is judgmental and subjective based on management’s evaluation of historical collection\nexperience, external market data and other factors, including those related to current market conditions and events. The Company is provided collateral\nrights of the franchisee’s restaurants (e.g., underlying franchise business, property and equipment) and personal guarantees from the operators to recover\nthe carrying value of the outstanding note receivable in the event collectability concerns arise. Therefore, the Company considers the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral rights (e.g., underlying franchisee business, property and equipment) and any guarantees when assessing the allowance for credit\nlosses (which may require third-party valuations of fair value). Notes receivable balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have\nceased.\nFranchisee notes receivable was $42.6 million with an allowance for credit losses of $14.5 million as of December 25, 2022 compared to $49.4 million\nwith an allowance for credit losses of $1.5 million as of December 26, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily due to an\nincrease for certain notes receivable primarily associated with a master franchisee with operations principally in Russia and the termination of significant\nfranchisees in the UK. See “Note 10. Allowance for Credit Losses” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIncome Tax Accounts and Tax Reserves\nPapa John’s is subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining Papa John’s\nprovision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable\nand those deferred. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities\nand are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for\nthe estimated future effects of tax attribute carryforwards (e.g., net operating losses, capital losses, and foreign tax credits). The effect on deferred taxes of\nchanges in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the new tax rate is enacted.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to realize and were\n$32.1 million and $28.6 million as of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will\nbe realized is based on the evaluation of historical profitability, future market growth, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing\ntemporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company assesses deferred taxes and the adequacy or need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly\nbasis.\n30\nTable of Contents\nTax authorities periodically audit the Company. We record reserves and related interest and penalties for identified exposures as income tax expense. We\nevaluate these issues and adjust for events, such as statute of limitations expirations, court rulings or audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate\npayment for such exposures.\nIn the event the Company is unable to generate future taxable income, there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, the time period within\nwhich the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the tax laws change unfavorably, then we could be required to increase the\nvaluation allowance against deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate. We estimate that a one percent\nchange in the effective income tax rate would impact the 2022 income tax expense by $0.8 million. See “Note 17. Income Taxes” of “Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\nGlobal Restaurant Sales and Unit Information\n“Comparable sales” represents the change in year-over-year sales for the same base of restaurants for the same fiscal periods. Comparable sales excludes\nsales of restaurants that were not open during both the current and prior fiscal periods and franchisees for which we suspended corporate support. “Global\nsystem-wide restaurant sales” represents total restaurant sales for all Company-owned and franchised restaurants open during the comparable periods, and\n“Global system-wide restaurant sales growth (decline)” represents the change in total system restaurant sales year-over-year. Global system-wide restaurant\nsales and global system-wide sales growth (decline) exclude franchisees for which we suspended corporate support.\n“Equivalent units” represents the number of restaurants open at the beginning of a given period, adjusted for restaurants opened, closed, acquired or sold\nduring the period on a weighted average basis.\nWe believe North America, International and global restaurant and comparable sales growth and Global system-wide restaurant sales information is useful\nin analyzing our results since our franchisees pay royalties and marketing fund contributions that are based on a percentage of franchise sales. Comparable\nsales and Global system-wide restaurant sales results for restaurants operating outside of the United States are reported on a constant dollar basis, which\nexcludes the impact of foreign currency translation. Franchise sales also generate commissary revenue in the United States and in certain international\nmarkets. Franchise restaurant and comparable sales growth information is also useful for comparison to industry trends and evaluating the strength of our\nbrand. Management believes the presentation of franchise restaurant sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, provides investors with useful\ninformation regarding underlying sales trends and the impact of new unit growth without being impacted by swings in the external factor of foreign\ncurrency. Franchise restaurant sales are not included in the Company’s revenues.\nYear Ended\nAmounts below exclude the impact of foreign currency December 25, 2022 December 26, 2021\nComparable sales growth (decline):\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants (1.0)% 11.3 %\nNorth America franchised restaurants 1.2 % 12.0 %\nNorth America restaurants 0.7 % 11.8 %\nInternational restaurants (5.3)% 13.0 %\nTotal comparable sales growth (decline) (0.8)% 12.1 %\nSystem-wide restaurant sales growth:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants 1.3 % 11.1 %\nNorth America franchised restaurants 2.5 % 13.0 %\nNorth America restaurants 2.3 % 12.6 %\nInternational restaurants (a) 4.8 % 24.4 %\nTotal global system-wide restaurant sales growth (a) 2.9 % 15.4 %\n______________________________\n(a) The twelve months ended December 25, 2022 excludes the impact of franchisee suspended restaurants.\n31\nTable of Contents\nRestaurant Progression Year Ended\nDecember 25, 2022 December 26, 2021\nNorth America Company-owned:\nBeginning of period 600 588\nOpened 10 11\nAcquired 2 —\nRefranchised (90) 1\nEnd of period 522 600\nNorth America franchised:\nBeginning of period 2,739 2,701\nOpened 76 74\nClosed (49) (35)\nRefranchised 90 —\nSold (2) (1)\nEnd of period 2,854 2,739\nInternational franchised:\nBeginning of period 2,311 2,111\nOpened 292 304\nClosed (85) (104)\nSuspended (a) (188) —\nEnd of period 2,330 2,311\nTotal restaurants – end of period 5,706 5,650\nFull year net store growth (b) 244 250\n______________________________\n(a) As previously disclosed, the Company has suspended corporate support for all franchised restaurants located in Russia.

Divestitures” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\nTotal revenues increased $33.7 million, or 1.6% to $2.10 billion for the year ended December 25, 2022, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact\nof the 2022 refranchising, total revenues increased $86.9 million, or 4.4%, for the year ended December 25, 2022.\nDomestic Company-owned restaurant sales decreased $69.9 million, or 9.0% for the year ended December 25, 2022 compared to the prior year. Excluding\nthe impact of the 2022 refranchising, Domestic Company-owned restaurant sales increased $8.7 million, or 1.3% for the year ended December 25, 2022,\nprimarily due to innovations and strategic pricing actions to help offset food and labor inflation. Equivalent units also increased 3.7% for the year ended\nDecember 25, 2022, excluding the 2022 refranchising, and the related increase was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 1.0%.\nNorth America franchise royalties and fees increased $8.1 million, or 6.3% for the year ended December 25, 2022 compared to the prior year. Excluding\nthe impact of 2022 refranchising, North America franchise royalties and fees increased $4.2 million, or 3.1% for the year ended December 25, 2022,\nprimarily due to an increase in comparable sales of 1.2% and equivalent units of 1.4%.\nNorth America franchise restaurant sales, excluding the impact of the 2022 refranchising, increased 2.3% to $2.99 billion for the year ended December 25,\n2022 compared to the prior year. North America franchise restaurant sales are not included in Company revenues; however, our North America franchise\nroyalties are derived from these sales.\nNorth America commissary revenues increased $108.3 million or 14.2% for the year ended December 25, 2022 compared to the prior year. North America\ncommissaries have increased prices in line with rising commodity prices driven by inflation, principally in cheese, soy oil, proteins and wheat.\nInternational revenues decreased $20.9 million, or 13.8% for the year ended December 25, 2022 compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower UK\ncommissary revenues. The overall declines in our International revenue performance were largely attributable to a decrease in comparable sales of 5.3% for\nthe year ended December 25, 2022 related to inflationary pressures in the PJUK market.\nInternational franchise restaurant sales decreased to $1.17 billion for the year ended December 25, 2022 compared to $1.27 billion for the year ended\nDecember 26, 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the previously disclosed franchisee suspended restaurants, International\nfranchise restaurant sales increased $58.2 million or 4.8% for the year ended December 25, 2022. International franchise restaurant sales are not included in\nCompany revenues; however, our International royalty revenue is derived from these sales.\nOther revenues, which primarily includes our national marketing funds, online and mobile ordering business and our wholly-owned print and promotions\nsubsidiary, increased $8.1 million, or 3.2% in 2022 primarily due to higher revenues\n33\nTable of Contents\nfrom our technology services from higher equivalent units and higher revenues from Preferred Marketing, our wholly-owned print and promotions\ncompany as they return to pre-pandemic levels.\nCosts and Expenses\nThe following table sets forth the various components of Costs and expenses from the Consolidated Statements of Operations, expressed as a percentage of\nthe associated revenue component.\nYear Ended\nIncrease\n% of Related % of Related (Decrease) in % of\n(Dollars in thousands) December 25, 2022 Revenues December 26, 2021 Revenues Revenues\nCosts and expenses:\nOperating costs (excluding depreciation and amortization\nshown separately below):\nDomestic Company-owned restaurant expenses $ 585,307 82.6 % $ 621,871 79.9 % 2.7 %\nNorth America commissary expenses 811,446 93.3 % 703,622 92.4 % 0.9 %\nInternational expenses 76,001 58.5 % 87,286 57.9 % 0.6 %\nOther expenses 238,810 93.0 % 226,320 91.0 % 2.0 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses 217,412 10.3 % 212,265 10.3 % — %\nDepreciation and amortization 52,032 2.5 % 48,816 2.4 % 0.1 %\nTotal costs and expenses 1,981,008 94.2 % 1,900,180 91.9 % 2.3 %\nRefranchising and impairment loss (12,065) (0.6)% — — % (0.6)%\nOperating income $ 109,030 5.2 % $ 168,241 8.1 % (2.9)%\nTotal costs and expenses were approximately $1.98 billion, or 94.2% of total revenues in 2022, as compared to $1.90 billion, or 91.9% of total revenues for\nthe prior year. The increase in total costs and expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily due to the following:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurant expenses were $585.3 million, or 82.6% of related revenues in 2022, compared to expenses of $621.9 million, or\n79.9% of related revenues for the prior year. The expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased 2.7% primarily due to increased food cost attributable to\nhigher commodity prices driven by inflation and labor expenses as staffing levels recover at increased cost. Our strategic pricing actions implemented in\n2022 helped reduce the impact of the underlying cost pressures.\nNorth America commissary expenses were $811.4 million, or 93.3% of related revenues in 2022, compared to $703.6 million, or 92.4% of related\nrevenues, for the prior year. The expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased 0.9% primarily due to rising commodity prices driven by inflation,\nprincipally in cheese, soy oil, proteins and wheat, and higher delivery costs.\nInternational expenses were $76.0 million, or 58.5% of related revenues, for 2022 compared to $87.3 million, or 57.9% of related revenues for the prior\nyear. International expenses were flat as a percentage of revenues as lower labor costs and lower food costs from negative comparable sales were offset by\nhigher distribution costs as a percentage of revenues.\nOther expenses were $238.8 million, or 93.0% of related revenues in 2022, as compared to $226.3 million, or 91.0% of related revenues for the prior year.\nThe expenses, as a percentage of related revenues, increased 2.0% primarily due to timing of expenditures on technology platform initiatives to further\nenhance our digital capabilities and the customer experience.\n34\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $217.4 million, or 10.3% of total revenues for 2022 compared to\n$212.3 million, or 10.3% of total revenues for the prior year. G&A expenses consisted of the following (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 25, 2022 December 26, 2021\nAdministrative expenses (a) $ 181,538 $ 199,452\nStrategic corporate reorganization costs (b) — 13,094\nLegal settlement accruals (c) 15,000 —\nAdditional specific accounts receivable and notes receivable provisions (d) 18,376 —\nOther general expenses (e) 2,498 (281)\nGeneral and administrative expenses $ 217,412 $ 212,265\n______________________________\n(a) The decrease in administrative expenses of $17.9 million for the year ended December 25, 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower incentive\ncompensation linked to Company performance, which was partially offset by higher labor costs as well as travel and occupancy costs associated with the re-opening of\ncorporate headquarters in the first quarter of 2022.\n(b) Represents strategic reorganization costs associated with our new corporate office in Atlanta which concluded at the end of 2021.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $52.0 million, or 2.5% of revenues in 2022, as compared to $48.8 million, or\n2.4% of revenues for the prior year, primarily due and increase in capital expenditures for our technology platforms and new restaurants.\nRefranchising and Impairment Loss\nRefranchising and impairment loss was $12.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2022 as compared to zero for the prior year. The 2022 amount was\ncomprised of an $8.4 million loss on our 2022 refranchising, an impairment loss of $2.8 million for reacquired franchise rights due to the financial and\noperational impact of the conflict in Ukraine and lease impairment charges of $0.9 million related to the termination of a significant franchisee in the UK.\nSee “Note 22.

The decrease in adjusted operating income in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to the following:\n• Domestic Company-owned restaurants decreased $25.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2022. Excluding the impact of the 2022\nrefranchising in the second quarter, Domestic Company-owned restaurants decreased $21.3 million, primarily due to higher commodity and labor\ncosts, partially offset by lower bonuses and higher revenues related to strategic pricing actions.\n• North America franchising increased $6.9 million for the year ended December 25, 2022. Excluding the impact of the 2022 refranchising, North\nAmerica franchising increased $4.3 million, due to an increase in comparable sales of 1.2% and higher equivalent units of 1.4%.\n• North America commissaries increased $2.7 million for the year ended December 25, 2022. North America commissaries have increased prices in\nline with inflation, which has been partially offset with lower margins due to lower volume of items sold.\n• International decreased $7.4 million for the year ended December 25, 2022, primarily due to significant inflation and high energy prices in the UK\nthat attributed to lower comparable sales, which declined 5.3%.\n• All Others, which primarily includes our online and mobile ordering business and our marketing funds, decreased $7.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 25, 2022, compared to the prior year, primarily due to timing of expenditures for technology support initiatives.\n• Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $7.0 million for the year ended December 25, 2022, primarily due to lower incentive compensation\ncosts, partially offset by higher labor, travel, professional fees and occupancy cost associated with the re-opening of corporate headquarters in the\nfirst quarter of 2022.\n36\nTable of Contents\nItems Below Operating Income\nThe following table sets forth the various items below Operating income from the Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nYear Ended\n(Dollars in thousands) December 25, 2022 December 26, 2021 Change\nOperating income $ 109,030 $ 168,241 $ (59,211)\nNet interest expense (25,261) (17,293) (7,968)\nIncome before income taxes 83,769 150,948 (67,179)\nIncome tax expense 14,420 25,993 (11,573)\nNet income before attribution to noncontrolling interests 69,349 124,955 (55,606)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,577) (4,939) 3,362\nNet income attributable to the Company $ 67,772 $ 120,016 $ (52,244)\nCalculation of net income for earnings per share:\nNet income attributable to the Company $ 67,772 $ 120,016 $ (52,244)\nDividends on redemption of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock — (109,852) 109,852\nDividends paid to participating securities (306) (6,091) 5,785\nNet income attributable to participating securities (104) — (104)\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 67,362 $ 4,073 $ 63,289\n—\nBasic earnings per common share $ 1.90 $ 0.12 $ 1.78\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 1.89 $ 0.12 $ 1.77\nNet Interest Expense\nInterest expense increased approximately $8.0 million for the year ended December 25, 2022 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average\noutstanding debt on our revolving credit facility. Total debt outstanding was $605.0 million and $490.0 million as of December 25, 2022 and December 26,\n2021, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe effective income tax rate was 17.2% for both 2022 and 2021.

Diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 26, 2021 was reduced by $3.10 from a reduction in net\nincome attributable to common shareholders related to the repurchase and conversion of all of the shares of the Company’s previously outstanding Series B\nConvertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”) during the second quarter of 2021. This reduction reflected the excess of the one-time cash\npayment over the carrying value of the Series B Preferred Stock. See “Note 6. Stockholders’ Deficit” and “Note 7. Earnings per Share” of “Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements,” for additional information. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, a non-GAAP measure, was $2.94 for the year\nended December 25, 2022 compared to $3.51 for the year ended December 26, 2021, representing a decrease of $0.57. See “Non-GAAP Measures” for\nadditional information.\n38\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP measures, which present results on an adjusted basis.\nThese are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the following: adjusted\noperating income, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted earnings per common share. We believe that our non-\nGAAP financial measures enable investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results\nand relative to other companies. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they reflect metrics that our\nmanagement team and Board of Directors utilize to evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and administer employee incentive plans. The\nmost directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted\ndiluted earnings per common share are operating income, net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share,\nrespectively.

Please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Free Cash Flow” for a\ndiscussion of why we believe free cash flow provides useful information regarding our financial condition and results of operations, and a reconciliation of\nfree cash flow to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\n40\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. Our principal uses of cash\nare operating expenses, capital expenditures, and returning value to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases. Our capital\npriorities are:\n• investing for growth\n• maintaining a strong balance sheet, and\n• returning capital to shareholders\nThe Company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity, along with cash generated by operations, will be sufficient to\nsatisfy its cash requirements, cash dividends, interest payments and share repurchases over the next twelve months and beyond.\nCash Flows\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for each of the last two fiscal years (in thousands):\n2022 2021\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 117,808 $ 184,675\nInvesting activities (62,793) (63,512)\nFinancing activities (76,240) (180,526)\nChange in cash and cash equivalents, excluding the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash\nequivalents $ (21,225) $ (59,363)\nOperating Activities\nTotal cash provided by operating activities was $117.8 million for the year ended December 25, 2022 compared to $184.7 million for the prior year. The\ndecrease of $66.9 million primarily reflects lower net income in 2022 and a reduction in working capital. The working capital reduction is driven by lower\naccrued expenses at December 25, 2022 as compared to the prior year, primarily related to lower incentive compensation payable and lower taxes payable\nat December 25, 2022. The decrease in incentive compensation payable is linked to Company performance while the decrease in taxes payable is linked to\nthe timing of payments related to the CARES Act. These decreases were partially offset by the provision for allowance for credit losses of $20.5 million\n(See “Note 10. Allowance for Credit Losses” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”) and refranchising and impairment losses of $12.1 million\n(discussed above in “Results of Operations”).\nInvesting Activities\nTotal cash used in investing activities was $62.8 million in 2022 compared to $63.5 million in 2021, a decrease of $0.7 million. 2022 cash flows included\n$13.6 million in proceeds, net of transaction costs, from the impact of the 2022 refranchising in the first quarter of 2022. Repayments of notes, net of\nissuances were $3.7 million in 2022 as compared to $2.4 million in 2021, an increase in inflows of $1.3 million for the year. The increased inflows from\nrefranchising and notes were offset by larger purchases of property and equipment of $9.8 million in 2022, as the Company improved its digital\ninfrastructure. Cash flows for 2021 also included an inflow of $3.3 million related to the sale of land that did not recur in 2022.\nFinancing Activities\nTotal cash used in financing activities was $76.2 million in 2022 compared to $180.5 million in 2021, an decrease of $104.3 million. In 2022, cash used for\nfinancing activities includes outflows of $125.0 million in share repurchases and $54.8 million of common dividends paid, offset by net borrowings of\n$115.0 million from the credit facility. In 2021, outflows include $340.0 million in repayments of the term loan, $188.6 million in payment of cash\nconsideration for the repurchase and conversion of all of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, and dividends to common and preferred\nshareholders of $40.4 million, offset by inflows of $400.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and net borrowings from the credit facility\nof $80.0 million.\n41\nTable of Contents\nDebt\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company issued $400.0 million of 3.875% senior notes (the “Notes”) which will mature on September 15, 2029. Concurrently\nwith the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) replacing the\nprevious credit agreement (“Previous Credit Agreement”). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an\naggregate available principal amount of $600.0 million (the “PJI Revolving Facility”), of which up to $40.0 million is available as swingline loans and up\nto $80.0 million is available as letters of credit. The PJI Revolving Facility will mature on September 14, 2026.\nThe net proceeds from the Notes, together with borrowings under the PJI Revolving Facility, were used to repay outstanding revolver and term loan\nborrowings under the Company’s Previous Credit Agreement.\nOur outstanding debt as of December 25, 2022 was $605.0 million, which was comprised of $400.0 million outstanding under the Notes and $205.0 million\noutstanding under the PJI Revolving Facility. Remaining availability under the PJI Revolving Facility was $395.0 million as of December 25, 2022.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, require customary reporting obligations,\nand restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, the consummation of certain mergers, consolidations, sales of\nassets and similar transactions, the making of investments, equity distributions and other restricted payments, and transactions with affiliates. The Company\nis also subject to certain financial covenants, as shown in the following table, that could restrict or impose constraints on the liquidity of our business:\nActual Ratio for the\nYear Ended\nPermitted Ratio December 25, 2 022\nLeverage ratio Not to exceed 5.25 to 1.0 2.6 to 1.0\nInterest coverage ratio Not less than 2.00 to 1.0 4.1 to 1.0\nOur leverage ratio is defined as outstanding debt divided by Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in our credit agreement), for the most recent four fiscal\nquarters. Our interest coverage ratio is defined as the sum of Consolidated EBITDA and consolidated rental expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters\ndivided by the sum of consolidated interest expense and consolidated rental expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters. We were in compliance with all\nfinancial covenants as of December 25, 2022.\nIn addition, the Indenture governing the Notes contains customary covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability\nand the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions or\nrepurchase or redeem our capital stock; prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; make loans and\ninvestments; sell assets; incur liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nPJMF, our national marketing fund, has a $20.0 million revolving line of credit (the “PJMF Revolving Facility”) pursuant to a Revolving Loan Agreement,\ndated September 30, 2015 with U.S. Bank National Association, as lender. The PJMF Revolving Facility is secured by substantially all assets of PJMF. The\nPJMF Revolving Facility matures on September 30, 2023, but is subject to annual amendments. The borrowings under the PJMF Revolving Facility accrue\ninterest at a variable rate of the one-month LIBOR plus 1.60%. There was no debt outstanding under the PJMF Revolving Facility as of December 25, 2022\nor December 26, 2021. The PJMF operating results and the related debt outstanding do not impact the financial covenants under the Amended Credit\nAgreement.\nSee “Note 12. Debt” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\nShare Repurchases\nAs part of our long-term growth and capital allocation strategy, we are committed to investing in share repurchases to provide ongoing value and enhanced\nreturns to our shareholders. On October 28, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with an indefinite duration for up to $425.0\nmillion of the Company’s common stock. This share\n42\nTable of Contents\nrepurchase program operated alongside our previous $75.0 million share repurchase authorization, which began on November 4, 2020 and expired on\nDecember 26, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase activity for the years ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021:\nMaximum Dollar\nTotal Average Aggregate Value of Shares\n(In thousands, except average price per share)\nNumbe r Price Cost of that May Yet Be\nof Shares Paid pe r Shares Purchased Under t he\nYear Ended Purchased Share Purchase d Plans or Programs\nDecember 25, 2022 1,343 $ 93.07 $ 125,000 $ 299,800\nDecember 26, 2021 594 $ 121.96 $ 72,499 $ 424,800\nSubsequent to year-end, we acquired an additional 319,307 shares at an aggregate cost of $27.6 million. Approximately $272.2 million remained available\nunder the Company’s share repurchase program as of February 16, 2023.\nThe Company utilizes a written trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, from time to time to facilitate the\nrepurchase of shares of our common stock under this share repurchase program. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common\nstock either through a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or otherwise.\nDividends\nThe Company paid aggregate dividends to common stockholders of $54.8 million ($1.54 per share) for the year ended December 25, 2022.\nThe Company paid dividends of approximately $46.0 million for the year ended December 26, 2021, consisting of the following:\n• $40.4 million paid to common stockholders ($1.15 per share);\n• $3.0 million in preferred dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock (3.6% of the investment per annum)\n• $1.5 million of common stock deemed dividend distributions in conjunction with the repurchase and conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock;\n• $1.1 million in common stock “pass-through” dividends to Series B Preferred Stockholders on an as-converted basis ($0.45 per share).\nOn January 26, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2023 dividend of $0.42 per common share, representing a $14.6 million aggregate\ndividend that was paid on February 17, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 6, 2023. The declaration and payment of any\nfuture dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows) less\npurchases of property and equipment and dividends paid to preferred stockholders. We view free cash flow as an important financial measure because it is\none factor that management uses in determining the amount of cash available for discretionary investment. Free cash flow is not a term defined by GAAP,\nand as a result, our measure of free cash flow might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash flow should not be\nconstrued as a substitute for or a better indicator of the Company’s performance than the Company’s GAAP measures.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s free cash flow for the last two years was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 25, 2022 December 26, 2021\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 117,808 $ 184,675\nPurchases of property and equipment (78,391) (68,559)\nDividends paid to preferred stockholders (a) — (6,394)\nFree cash flow $ 39,417 $ 109,722\n______________________________\n(a) Excludes $188.6 million of cash consideration paid for the repurchase and conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock in the second quarter of 2021.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company’s cash requirements greater than twelve months from contractual obligations and commitments include:\n• Debt Obligations and Interest Payments: Refer to “Note 12. Debt” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information on\nour obligations and the timing of expected payments.\n• Operating and Finance Leases: Refer to “Note 3 Leases” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information on our\nobligations and the timing of expected payments.\nWe estimate that our capital expenditures during 2023 will be approximately $80 million to $90 million. This estimate includes development of Company-\nowned restaurants and technology enhancements. We intend to fund our capital expenditures with cash generated by operations and borrowings under our\nsenior secured revolving credit facility, as necessary.\nWe guarantee leases for certain Papa Johns North American franchisees who have purchased restaurants that were previously Company-owned. We are\ncontingently liable on these leases. The leases have varying terms, the latest of which expires in 2036. As of December 25, 2022, the estimate maximum\namount of undiscounted payments the Company could be required to make in the event of nonpayment by the primary lessees was approximately $9.2\nmillion.\nWe have certain other commercial commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. With our insurance programs, we are\nparty to surety bonds with off-balance sheet risk for a total of $26.3 million as of December 25, 2022. The surety bond arrangements expire within one year\nbut have automatic renewal clauses. See “Note 12. Debt” and “Note 19. Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements” for additional information related to contractual and other commitments.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe experienced price increases in food items and other commodities, labor and benefits, and fuel and other energy costs during 2022 and expect further\ninflationary pressure during 2023. Inflationary pressures affect our profitability both directly, in our company-owned restaurants and delivery mechanisms\nand through gross margins experienced by sales of food and supply items via our Quality Control Centers, as well as indirectly, through higher food\ningredient and paper and supply costs, rising fees from delivery aggregators driven by higher wage demands and increases in the cost of gasoline that, once\nreflected in upward price adjustments on their fees, can exert downward pressure on unit sales, reducing royalty fees we realize from our Domestic and\nInternational franchisees. Compensating menu price increases are subject to competitive pressure in the markets in which we operate. Expense control\nmeasures are also deployed to offset higher costs when possible. Food costs, in particular the cost of cheese, are managed to an extent by pricing\nagreements with suppliers and forward purchase contracts we enter into, as discussed in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market\nRisk.”\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other Company communications that are not statements of historical fact constitute\nforward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Generally, the use of words such as “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “believe,”\n“anticipate,” “will,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” or similar words identify forward-looking statements that we intend to be included within the\nsafe harbor protections provided\n44\nTable of Contents\nby the federal securities laws. Such forward-looking statements include or may relate to projections or guidance concerning business performance, revenue,\nearnings, cash flow, earnings per share, share repurchases, the current economic environment, the continuing impact of the coronavirus pandemic,\ncommodity and labor costs, currency fluctuations, profit margins, net unit growth, unit level performance, capital expenditures, restaurant and franchise\ndevelopment, labor shortages and price increases, inflation, royalty relief, franchisee support, the effectiveness of our menu innovations and other business\ninitiatives, investments in product and digital innovation, marketing efforts, liquidity, compliance with debt covenants, impairments, strategic decisions and\nactions, dividends, effective tax rates, regulatory changes and impacts, adoption of new accounting standards, and other financial and operational measures.\nSuch statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which are difficult to predict and many\nof which are beyond our control. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those matters expressed or implied in such forward-\nlooking statements. The risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are involved in our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:\n• the ability of the Company to manage challenging macroeconomic conditions in the United States and internationally, including the United\nKingdom;\n• the ability of the Company to manage staffing and labor shortages at Company and/or franchised restaurants and our quality control centers;\n• increases in labor costs, food costs or sustained higher other operating costs, including as a result of supply chain disruption, inflation or climate\nchange;\n• the potential for delayed new store openings, both domestically and internationally;\n• the increased risk of phishing, ransomware and other cyber-attacks;\n• risks to the global economy and our business related to the conflict in Ukraine and other international conflicts;\n• increased costs for branding initiatives and launching new advertising and marketing campaigns and promotions to boost consumer sentiment and\nsales trends, and the risk that such initiatives will not be effective;\n• risks related to social media, including publicity adversely and rapidly impacting our brand and reputation;\n• aggressive changes in pricing or other marketing or promotional strategies by competitors, which may adversely affect sales and profitability; and\nnew product and concept developments by food industry competitors;\n• changes in consumer preferences or consumer buying habits, including the growing popularity of delivery aggregators, as well as changes in\ngeneral economic conditions or other factors that may affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending, including higher unemployment;\n• the adverse impact on the Company or our results caused by global health concerns, product recalls, food quality or safety issues, incidences of\nfoodborne illness, food contamination and other general public health concerns about our Company-owned or franchised restaurants or others in\nthe restaurant industry;\n• the effectiveness of our technology investments and changes in unit-level operations;\n• the ability of the Company and its franchisees to meet planned growth targets and operate new and existing restaurants profitably, including\ndifficulties finding qualified franchisees, store level employees or suitable sites;\n• increases in insurance claims and related costs for programs funded by the Company up to certain retention limits, including medical, owned and\nnon-owned vehicles, workers’ compensation, general liability and property;\n• disruption of our supply chain or commissary operations which could be caused by our sole source of supply of mozzarella cheese, desserts, garlic\ncups or limited source of suppliers for other key ingredients or more generally due to weather, natural disasters including drought, disease, or\ngeopolitical or other disruptions beyond our control, including the coronavirus pandemic;\n• increased risks associated with our International operations, including economic and political conditions and risks associated with the withdrawal\nof the UK from the European Union, instability or uncertainty in our international markets, especially emerging markets, fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates, difficulty in meeting planned sales targets and new store growth;\n• the impact of current or future claims and litigation and our ability to comply with current, proposed or future legislation that could impact our\nbusiness including compliance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation;\n• the Company’s ability to continue to pay dividends to stockholders based upon profitability, cash flows and capital adequacy if restaurant sales and\noperating results decline;\n• continuing risks related to the outbreak of COVID-19 and other health crises;\n• disruption of critical business or information technology systems, or those of our suppliers, and risks associated with systems failures and data\nprivacy and security breaches, including theft of confidential Company, employee and customer information, including payment cards; and\n• changes in Federal or state income, general and other tax laws, rules and regulations and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\n45\nTable of Contents\nThese and other risk factors are discussed in detail in “Part I. Item 1A. — Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and they may be updated\nfrom time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-\nlooking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise, except as required by law.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on our PJI Revolving Facility. We attempt to minimize interest rate risk exposure by fixing our\ninterest rate through the utilization of interest rate swaps, which are derivative financial instruments. The interest rate swaps were eligible for hedge\naccounting for part of the period. Our swaps are entered into with financial institutions that participate in the PJI Revolving Facility. By using a derivative\ninstrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we expose ourselves to credit risk due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform\nunder the terms of the derivative contract. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. See “Note 12. Debt” of\n“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our debt obligations and derivative instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from our operations outside of the United States, which can adversely impact our revenues,\nnet income and cash flows. Our International operations principally consist of distribution sales to franchised Papa John’s restaurants located in the UK and\nour franchise sales and support activities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our\nInternational franchisees. Approximately 6.2% of our 2022 revenues, 7.3% of our 2021 revenues and 6.8% of our 2020 revenues were derived from these\nInternational operations.\nWe have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of\napproximately $13.3 million on our total revenues in 2022, compared to a favorable impact of approximately $8.1 million in 2021 and an unfavorable\nimpact of approximately $0.6 million in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $2.0 million on our operating\nincome in 2022 compared to a favorable impact of $1.4 million in 2021 and an unfavorable impact of $1.0 million in 2020. A 10% adverse change in the\nforeign currency rates for our International markets would result in an additional negative impact on annual revenue and operating income of\napproximately $13.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, based on annual revenue and operating income for the year ended December 25, 2022.\nCommodity Price Risk\nIn the ordinary course of business, the food and paper products we purchase, including cheese (our largest ingredient cost), are subject to seasonal\nfluctuations, weather, availability, demand and other factors that are beyond our control. We have pricing agreements with some of our vendors, including\nforward pricing agreements for a portion of our cheese purchases for our Domestic Company-owned restaurants, which are accounted for as normal\npurchases; however, we still remain exposed to on-going commodity volatility.\nThe following table presents the actual average block price for cheese by quarter in 2022, 2021 and 2020. Also presented is the projected 2023 average\nblock price by quarter (based on the February 16, 2023 Chicago Mercantile Exchange cheese futures prices):\n2023 2022 2021 2020\nProjected Block Block Block\nMarket Price Price Price\nQuarter 1 $ 1.951 $ 1.966 $ 1.676 $ 1.857\nQuarter 2 1.934 2.296 1.680 1.679\nQuarter 3 2.066 1.938 1.676 2.262\nQuarter 4 2.062 2.066 1.786 2.235\nFull Year $ 2.003 $ 2.067 $ 1.705 $ 2.008\n46\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 25, 2022 and December 26,\n2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2022, in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework), and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an\nunqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion\non the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n48\nTable of Contents\nMeasurement and valuation of insurance reserves\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is self-insured for certain\nobligations up to stated retention levels under its retention programs related to workers’ compensation,\nautomobile, property and general liability programs. As of December 25, 2022, the Company has $67.3\nmillion accrued for self-insurance reserves (“Insurance Reserves”). Judgments and estimates are used by the\nCompany in determining the potential value associated with incurred but not reported claims.\nAuditing the measurement and valuation of the Insurance Reserves is highly judgmental and complex due to\nthe significant uncertainty in estimating the potential value of reported claims, estimating the number and\npotential value of incurred but not reported claims and the use of actuarial valuation methods. The reserve\nestimate is sensitive to actuarial assumptions (e.g., future emergence of losses, incurred but not reported\nclaims) used to estimate the ultimate liability for reported claims and claims that have been incurred but have\nnot been reported.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in We tested controls related to the measurement and valuation of the Insurance Reserves. For example, we\nOur Audit tested controls over management’s review of the assumptions and methods used to establish the estimate, the\nunderlying data, significant actuarial assumptions and the related reconciliations.\nTo test the measurement and valuation of the Insurance Reserves, our audit procedures included, among\nothers, performing transactional tests of details over the completeness and accuracy of claims data and\nvouching payments made to third parties. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in the\nevaluation of the key assumptions and methodologies used by management to determine the Insurance\nReserves.\n/s/ Ernst & Young

Description of Business\nPapa John’s International, Inc. (referred to as the “Company,” “Papa John’s,” “Papa Johns” or in the first person notations of “we,” “us” and “our”),\noperates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants under the trademark “Papa John’s,” in 48 countries and territories as of December 25, 2022.\nOur revenues are derived from retail sales of pizza and other food and beverage products to the general public by Company-owned restaurants, franchise\nroyalties and sales of franchise and development rights, printing and promotional items and information systems equipment, and software and related\nservices. We generate revenues from the operation of our Quality Control Centers (“QC Centers”) which supply pizza sauce, dough, food products, paper\nproducts, smallwares and cleaning supplies to restaurants. We also derive revenue from contributions received into our national marketing funds.\nIn discussions of our business, “Domestic” is defined as within the contiguous United States, “North America” includes Canada, and “International”\nincludes the rest of the world other than North America.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Papa John’s International, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated.\nVariable Interest Entity\nPapa John’s Domestic restaurants, both Company-owned and franchised, participate in Papa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”), a nonstock corporation\ndesigned to operate at break-even as it spends all annual contributions received from the system. PJMF collects a percentage of revenues from Company-\nowned and franchised restaurants in the United States for the purpose of designing and administering advertising and promotional programs. PJMF is a\nvariable interest entity (“VIE”) that funds its operations with ongoing financial support and contributions from the Domestic restaurants, of which\napproximately 85 percent are franchised, and does not have sufficient equity to fund its operations without these ongoing financial contributions. Based on\nan assessment of the governance structure and operating procedures of PJMF, the Company determined it has the power to control certain significant\nactivities of PJMF, and therefore, is the primary beneficiary. The Company has consolidated PJMF in its financial results in accordance with Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 810, “Consolidation.”\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December of each year. All fiscal years presented consist of 52 weeks.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.\nSignificant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include the allowance for credit losses on accounts and notes receivable, intangible\nassets, contract assets and contract liabilities including the customer loyalty program obligation, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, gift card breakage,\ninsurance reserves and tax reserves. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances, actual results could significantly differ from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in contracts with customers and excludes waivers or incentives and amounts collected on behalf of\nthird parties, primarily sales tax. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or\nservice to a customer. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction,\nthat are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Delivery costs, including freight associated with our Domestic commissary\nand other sales, are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in operating costs.\n56\nTable of Contents\nThe following describes principal activities, separated by major product or service, from which the Company generates its revenues:\nDomestic Company-owned Restaurant Sales\nThe Domestic Company-owned restaurants principally generate revenue from retail sales of high-quality pizza, Papadias, which are flatbread-style\nsandwiches, and side items including breadsticks, Papa Bites, cheesesticks, chicken poppers and wings, dessert items and canned or bottled beverages.\nRevenues from Company-owned restaurants are recognized when the products are delivered to or carried out by customers.\nOur North American customer loyalty program, Papa Rewards, is a spend-based program that rewards customers with points for each purchase. Papa\nRewards points are accumulated and redeemed for dollar off discounts (“Papa Dough”) to be used on future purchases within a six-month expiration\nwindow. The accrued liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and corresponding reduction of Company-owned restaurant sales in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations, is for the estimated reward redemptions at Domestic Company-owned restaurants based upon estimated redemption patterns. The\nliability related to Papa Rewards is calculated using the estimated redemption value for which the points and accumulated rewards are expected to be\nredeemed. Revenue is recognized when the customer redeems the Papa Dough reward and when the points or Papa Dough reward expires.\nFranchise Royalties and Fees\nFranchise royalties, which are based on a percentage of franchise restaurant sales, are recognized as sales occur. Incentives offered from time to time,\nincluding new store incentives, will reduce the contractual royalty rate paid. Any royalty reductions, including waivers or those offered as part of a new\nstore development incentive or as incentive for other behaviors, including acceleration of restaurant remodels or equipment upgrades, are recognized at the\nsame time as the related royalty, as they are not separately distinguishable from the full royalty rate. Our current standard franchise agreement requires the\nfranchisee to pay a royalty fee of 5% of sales, and the majority of our existing franchised restaurants have a 5% contractual royalty rate in effect. Franchise\nroyalties are billed on a monthly basis.\nThe majority of initial franchise license fees and area development exclusivity fees are from International locations. Initial franchise license fees are billed\nat the store opening date. The pre-opening services provided to franchisees do not contain separate and distinct performance obligations from the franchise\nright; thus, the fees collected will be deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis beginning at the store opening date through the term of the franchise\nagreement, which is typically 10 years. Franchise license renewal fees for both Domestic and International locations, which generally occur every 10 years,\nare billed before the renewal date. Fees received for future license renewal periods are deferred and amortized over the life of the renewal period. Area\ndevelopment exclusivity fees are billed upon execution of the development agreements which grant the right to develop franchised restaurants in future\nperiods in specific geographic areas. Area development exclusivity fees are allocated on a pro rata basis to all restaurants opened under that specific\ndevelopment agreement. These fees are deferred and amortized over the term of the related franchise agreements, which is typically 10 years.\nCommissary Revenues\nCommissary revenues are comprised of food and supplies sold to franchised restaurants and are recognized as revenue upon shipment of the related\nproducts to the franchisees. Payments are generally due within 30 days.\nThere are various incentive programs available to franchisees related to new restaurant openings including discounts on initial commissary orders and new\nstore equipment incentives, at substantially no cost to franchisees. Commissary revenues are reduced to reflect incentives in the form of direct discounts on\ninitial commissary orders. The new store equipment incentive is also recorded as a reduction of commissary sales over the term of the incentive agreement,\nwhich is generally three to five years.\nOther Revenues\nFranchise Marketing Fund revenues represent a required established percentage of monthly restaurant sales collected by PJMF, which is our national\nmarketing fund, and various other international and Domestic marketing funds (“Co-op” or “Co-operative” Funds) where we have determined for purposes\nof accounting that we have control over the significant activities of the funds. PJMF funds its operations with ongoing financial support and contributions\nfrom Domestic Papa John’s restaurants, of which approximately 85% are franchised restaurant members. Contributions are based on a percentage of\nmonthly restaurant sales and are billed monthly. When we are determined to be the principal in these\n57\nTable of Contents\narrangements, advertising fund contributions and expenditures are reported on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our obligation\nrelated to these funds is to develop and conduct advertising activities in a specific country, region, or market, including the placement of electronic and\nprint materials.\nThere are no expiration dates and we do not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift cards. While the Company and the franchisees continue to honor\nall gift cards presented for payment, the likelihood of redemption may be determined to be remote for certain cards due to long periods of inactivity. In\nthese circumstances, the Company recognizes breakage revenue for amounts not subject to unclaimed property laws. Based upon our analysis of historical\ngift card redemption patterns, we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote. Breakage revenue is recognized over\ntime in proportion to estimated redemption patterns as Other revenues. Commissions on gift cards sold by third parties are recorded as a reduction to\nDeferred revenue and a reduction to Other revenues based upon estimated redemption patterns.\nFees for information services, including software maintenance fees, help desk fees, centralized call center fees, and online ordering fees are recognized as\nrevenue as such services are provided and are included in Other revenues.\nRevenues for printing, promotional items, and direct mail marketing services are recognized upon shipment of the related products to franchisees and other\ncustomers. Direct mail advertising discounts are also periodically offered by our Preferred Marketing Solutions subsidiary. Other revenues are reduced to\nreflect these advertising discounts.\nRental income, primarily derived from properties leased by the Company and subleased to franchisees in the UK, is recognized on a straight-line basis over\nthe respective operating lease terms.\nAdvertising and Related Costs\nDomestic Company-owned advertising and related costs of $55.2 million, $61.7 million and $56.7 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, include\nthe costs of Domestic Company-owned local restaurant activities such as mail coupons, door hangers and promotional items and advertising activities\nadministered through PJMF and various local market cooperative advertising funds. PJMF is responsible for developing and conducting marketing and\nadvertising for the Domestic Papa John’s system. The Co-op Funds are responsible for developing and conducting advertising activities in a specific\nmarket, including the placement of electronic and print materials developed by PJMF. During 2020 the Company recorded additional amounts of $15.0\nmillion to PJMF, representing incremental discretionary marketing fund investments in excess of contractual Company-owned restaurant-level\ncontributions as part of our temporary financial support package to our franchisees. The marketing fund investments are included in General and\nadministrative expenses within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nLeases\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease term for operating leases, whereas lease expense follows an\naccelerated expense recognition for finance leases. A lease term often includes option periods, available at the inception of the lease. Lease expense is\ncomprised of operating and finance lease costs, short-term lease costs, and variable lease costs, which primarily include common area maintenance, real\nestate taxes, and insurance for the Company’s real estate leases. Lease costs also include variable rent, which is primarily related to the Company’s supply\nchain tractor and trailer leases that are based on a rate per mile.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for equity grants is estimated on the grant date, net of projected forfeitures, and is recognized over the vesting period (graded\nvesting over three years). Restricted stock is valued based on the market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. Management evaluates its\naward grants and modifications and will adjust the fair value if any are determined to be spring-loaded.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less at date of purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which\napproximates fair value.\nAccounts Receivable\nSubstantially all accounts receivable is due from franchisees for purchases of food, paper products, point of sale equipment, printing and promotional items,\ninformation systems and related services, marketing and royalties. Credit is extended based\n58\nTable of Contents\non an evaluation of the franchisee’s financial condition and collateral is generally not required. An allowance for credit losses is an estimate, even if\nremote, based upon historical account write-off trends, facts about the current financial condition of the debtor, forecasts of future operating results based\nupon current trends of select operating metrics and macroeconomic factors. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts\nhave ceased.\nNotes Receivable\nThe Company has provided financing to select Domestic and International franchisees principally for use in the construction and development of their\nrestaurants and for the purchase of restaurants from the Company or other franchisees. Most notes receivable bear interest at fixed or floating rates and are\ngenerally secured by the assets of each restaurant and the ownership interests in the franchise. The Company has provided long-term financing to certain\nfranchisees with royalty payment plans. We establish an allowance for credit losses for franchisee notes receivables to reduce the outstanding notes\nreceivable to their net realizable values based on a review of each franchisee’s economic performance and market conditions after consideration of the fair\nvalue of our underlying collateral rights (e.g., underlying franchisee business, property and equipment) and any guarantees. Note balances are charged off\nagainst the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased.\nInterest income recorded on franchisee loans was approximately $1.3 million in 2022, $1.9 million in 2021 and $2.1 million in 2020 and is reported in Net\ninterest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInventories\nInventories, which consist of food products, paper goods and supplies, smallwares, and printing and promotional items, are stated at the lower of cost,\ndetermined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally\nfive to ten years for restaurant, commissary and other equipment, twenty to forty years for buildings and improvements, and five years for technology and\ncommunication assets). Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases,\nincluding the first renewal period (generally five to ten years).\nDepreciation expense was $45.6 million in 2022, $43.0 million in 2021 and $46.6 million in 2020.\nDeferred Costs\nWe capitalize certain information systems development and related costs that meet established criteria. Amounts capitalized, which are included in property\nand equipment, are amortized principally over periods not exceeding five years upon completion of the related information systems project. Total costs\ncapitalized were approximately $4.1 million in 2022, $4.1 million in 2021 and $3.3 million in 2020. The unamortized information systems development\ncosts approximated $9.6 and $10.5 million as of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively.\nIntangible Assets — Goodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever we identify certain triggering events or circumstances that would more-likely-than-not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of our reporting\nunits, which includes our Domestic Company-owned restaurants, United Kingdom (“PJUK”), China, and Preferred Marketing Solutions operations. We\nmay perform a qualitative assessment or move directly to the quantitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period if we believe that it is more\nefficient or if impairment indicators exist.\nWe elected to perform a quantitative assessment for our Domestic Company-owned restaurants, PJUK, China, and Preferred Marketing Solutions\noperations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Domestic Company-owned restaurants, PJUK, China and Preferred Marketing Solutions fair value\ncalculations considered both an income approach and a market approach. The income approach used projected net cash flows, with various growth\nassumptions, over a ten-year discrete period and a terminal value, which were discounted using appropriate rates. The selected discount rate considered the\nrisk and nature of each reporting unit’s cash flow and the rates of return market participants would require to invest their capital in the reporting unit. In\ndetermining the fair value from a market approach, we considered sales multiples and earnings\n59\nTable of Contents\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples that a potential buyer would pay based on third-party transactions in similar markets.\nAs a result of our quantitative analyses, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their\ncarrying amounts. Subsequent to completing our goodwill impairment tests, no indicators of impairment were identified. See “Note 11. Goodwill” for\nadditional information.\nDeferred Income Tax Accounts and Tax Reserves\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for\nincome taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable and those\ndeferred.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured\nusing enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted by tax\njurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax attribute carryforwards (e.g., net operating losses, capital losses,\nand foreign tax credits). The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the new tax rate is enacted. Valuation\nallowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to realize.\nTax authorities periodically audit the Company. We record reserves and related interest and penalties for identified exposures as income tax expense. We\nevaluate these issues and adjust for events, such as statute of limitations expirations, court rulings or audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate\npayment for such exposures. See “Note 17. Income Taxes” for additional information.\nInsurance Reserves\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability and property insurance coverage provided to our\nemployees are funded by the Company up to certain retention limits which range up to $0.5 million.\nLosses are accrued based upon undiscounted estimates of the liability for claims incurred and for events that have occurred but have not been reported\nusing certain third-party actuarial projections and our claims loss experience. The determination of the recorded insurance reserves is highly judgmental\nand complex due to the significant uncertainty in the potential value of reported claims and the number and potential value of incurred but not reported\nclaims, the application of significant judgment in making those estimates and the use of various actuarial valuation methods. The estimated insurance\nclaims losses could be significantly affected should the frequency or ultimate cost of claims differ significantly from historical trends used to estimate the\ninsurance reserves recorded by the Company. The Company records estimated losses above retention within its reserve with a corresponding receivable for\nexpected amounts due from insurance carriers.\nAs of December 25, 2022, our insurance reserve was $67.3 million as compared to $88.1 million as of December 26, 2021 primarily related to auto liability\nand workers’ compensation claims. Of these amounts, approximately $29.7 million and $34.7 million were recorded in Accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities and $37.6 million and $53.6 million were recorded in Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 25, 2022\nand December 26, 2021, respectively. Our reserves include claim costs above our retention that have a corresponding receivable. Our insurance receivable\nfor claims above retention totaled $38.4 million and $48.1 million as of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively. Of these amounts,\napproximately $17.0 million and $18.7 million were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, and $21.4 million and $29.4 million were\nrecorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. At inception and on an ongoing basis, we assess whether each derivative that qualifies for\nhedge accounting continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. If the derivative meets the hedge criteria as\ndefined by certain accounting standards, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the\nchange in fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) until the\nhedged item is recognized in earnings. In 2021, our interest rate swaps were de-designated as cash flow hedges following the issuance of the Notes (as\ndefined in “Note 12. Debt”) and remained undesignated as hedges through June 26, 2022. For\n60\nTable of Contents\nthese de-designated hedges, the portion of gains or losses on the derivative instruments previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss\n(“AOCL”) will be reclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the originally hedged\ntransactions.\nAs of June 27, 2022, the interest rate swaps were re-designated as cash flow hedges to provide a hedge against changes in variable rate cash flows\nregarding fluctuations in the London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”) rate utilized on the revolving credit facility. Therefore, beginning in the third\nquarter of 2022, our interest rate swaps are accounted for utilizing cash flow hedge accounting treatment. The interest rate swaps are marked to market at\neach reporting date and any unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCL and reclassified to interest expense in the same period or periods during which\nthe hedged transactions affect earnings.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nPapa John’s has joint venture arrangements in which there are noncontrolling interests held by third parties that included 98 and 188 restaurants at\nDecember 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively. As further described in “Note 22. Divestitures,” the Company divested its 51 percent interest in\none joint venture that owned 90 restaurants in the second quarter of 2022. Consolidated net income is required to be reported separately at amounts\nattributable to both the Company and the noncontrolling interests. Additionally, disclosures are required to clearly identify and distinguish between the\ninterests of the Company and the interests of the noncontrolling owners, including a disclosure on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations of\nincome attributable to the noncontrolling interest holder.\nThe following summarizes the redemption feature, location and related accounting within the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these joint venture\narrangements:\nLocation within the\nType of Joint Venture Arrangement Consolidated Balance Sheets Recorded Value\nJoint ventures with no redemption feature Permanent equity Carrying value\nJoint venture with option to require the Company to purchase the noncontrolling interest - not\ncurrently redeemable or redemption not probable Temporary equity Carrying value\nSee “Note 9.

Revenues and expenses are translated into United States (“U.S.”) dollars\nusing monthly average exchange rates, while assets and liabilities are translated using year-end exchange rates and historical rates. The resulting translation\nadjustments are included as a component of AOCL, net of income taxes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nReference Rate Reform – Hedging\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-04, “Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on\nFinancial Reporting.” The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting related\nto the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates if certain criteria are met. This guidance was\neffective beginning on March 12, 2020, and amendments could be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. The hedge accounting expedients\nmay be applied, on an individual hedging relationship basis, to eligible hedge accounting relationships that existed as of the beginning of the effective date\nof this guidance, and to new eligible hedging relationships entered into after the effective date of this guidance; however, those expedients generally could\nnot be applied to hedging relationships for periods after December 31, 2022. The FASB issued ASU 2022-06, “Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,”\nwhich deferred the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company adopted certain optional hedge accounting expedients\nprovided by ASU 2020-04 during fiscal 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial\nposition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n61\nTable of Contents\n3. Leases\nThe Company has significant leases that include most Domestic Company-owned restaurant and commissary locations as well as our corporate office\nlocated in Atlanta, Georgia. Other Domestic leases include tractor and trailer leases used by our distribution subsidiary as well as commissary equipment.\nAdditionally, the Company leases a significant number of restaurants within the United Kingdom (“UK”); these restaurants are then subleased to the\nfranchisees. The Company’s leases have terms as follows:\nAverage lease term\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants Five years, plus at least one renewal\nUK franchise-owned restaurants 15 years\nDomestic commissary locations 10 years, plus at least one renewal\nDomestic and International tractors and trailers Five to seven years\nDomestic and International commissary and office equipment Three to five years\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception and recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease\ncommencement date. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less but greater than one month are not recorded on the balance sheet for select asset\nclasses. The lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments as of the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset recognized\nis based on the lease liability adjusted for prepaid and deferred rent and unamortized lease incentives. An operating lease right-of-use asset is amortized on\na straight-line basis over the lease term and is recognized as a single lease cost against the operating lease liability. A finance lease right-of-use asset is\namortized on a straight-line basis, with interest costs reported separately, over the lesser of the useful life of the leased asset or lease term. Operating lease\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in Operating costs or General and administrative expenses. Variable lease\npayments are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company uses its incremental borrowing rates as the discount rate for its leases, which is equal to the rate of interest the Company would have to pay\non a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. The lease terms for all the Company’s leases include the\ncontractually obligated period of the leases, plus any additional periods covered by Company options to extend the leases that the Company is reasonably\ncertain to exercise.\nCertain leases provide that the lease payments may be increased annually based on the fixed rate terms or adjustable terms such as the Consumer Price\nIndex. Future base rent escalations that are not contractually quantifiable as of the lease commencement date are not included in our lease liability.\nThe following schedule details the total right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 25, 2022 and\nDecember 26, 2021 (in thousands):\nDecember 25, December 26,\nLeases Classification 2022 2021\nAssets\nFinance lease assets, net Finance lease right-of-use assets, net $ 24,941 $ 20,907\nOperating lease assets, net Operating lease right-of-use assets 172,425 176,256\nTotal lease assets $ 197,366 $ 197,163\nLiabilities\nCurrent finance lease liabilities Current finance lease liabilities $ 6,850 $ 4,977\nCurrent operating lease liabilities Current operating lease liabilities 23,418 22,543\nNoncurrent finance lease liabilities Long-term finance lease liabilities 19,022 16,580\nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities Long-term operating lease liabilities 160,905 160,672\nTotal lease liabilities $ 210,195 $ 204,772\n62\nTable of Contents\nLease costs for the years ended December 25, 2022, December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended Year Ended Year Ended\nDecember 25, 2 022 December 26, 2 021 December 27, 2 020\nFinance lease:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets $ 5,704 $ 4,980 $ 2,342\nInterest on lease liabilities 1,029 1,140 606\nOperating lease:\nOperating lease cost 42,815 43,072 40,026\nShort-term lease cost 4,171 2,032 3,960\nVariable lease cost 9,129 8,572 6,503\nTotal lease costs 62,848 59,796 53,437\nSublease income (11,654) (12,039) (10,407)\nTotal lease costs, net of sublease income $ 51,194 $ 47,757 $ 43,030\nFuture minimum lease payments under contractually-obligated leases and associated sublease income as of December 25, 2022 were as follows (in\nthousands):\nFinance Operating Expected\nLease Lease Sublease\nFiscal Year Costs Costs Income\n2023 $ 7,849 $ 32,860 $ 10,303\n2024 6,801 32,267 10,371\n2025 5,171 30,695 9,952\n2026 4,125 26,973 9,251\n2027 2,971 21,568 8,523\nThereafter 1,440 92,002 42,089\nTotal future minimum lease payments 28,357 236,365 90,489\nLess imputed interest (2,485) (52,042) —\nTotal present value of lease liabilities $ 25,872 $ 184,323 $ 90,489\nLessor Operating Leases\nThe Company subleases certain retail space to our franchisees in the UK which are primarily operating leases. At December 25, 2022, we leased and\nsubleased approximately 442 Papa John’s restaurants to franchisees in the UK. The initial lease terms on the franchised sites in the UK are generally 15\nyears. The Company has the option to negotiate an extension toward the end of the lease term at the landlord’s discretion. The initial lease terms of the\nfranchisee subleases are generally five to ten years. Rental income, primarily derived from properties leased and subleased to franchisees in the UK, is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the respective operating lease terms. The Company recognized total sublease income of $11.7 million, $12.0\nmillion and $10.4 million for the years ended December 25, 2022, December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively, within Other revenues in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nLease Guarantees\nAs a result of assigning our interest in obligations under property leases as a condition of the refranchising of certain restaurants, we are contingently liable\nfor payment of approximately 53 Domestic leases. These leases have varying terms, the latest of which expires in 2036. As of December 25, 2022, the\nestimated maximum amount of undiscounted payments the Company could be required to make in the event of nonpayment by the primary lessees was\n$9.2 million. This contingent liability is not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet or future minimum lease obligation. The fair value of the guarantee\nis not material.\nThere were no leases recorded between related parties.\n63\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental Cash Flow & Other Information\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 25, 2022, December 26, 2021 and\nDecember 27, 2020:\nYear Ended\n(Dollars in thousands) December 25, 2022 December 26, 2021 December 27, 2020\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from finance leases $ 1,029 $ 1,140 $ 606\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases $ 5,416 $ 4,566 $ 2,139\nOperating cash flows from operating leases (a) $ 35,573 $ 38,530 $ 37,113\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities $ 9,875 $ 9,486 $ 9,152\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities\n(b) $ 53,869 $ 64,420 $ 30,266\nCash received from sublease income $ 10,847 $ 11,597 $ 10,545\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years):\nFinance leases 4.43 4.51 4.71\nOperating leases 8.44 8.30 7.00\nWeighted-average discount rate:\nFinance leases 4.59% 5.08% 5.34%\nOperating leases 5.63% 6.20% 6.65%\n______________________________\n(a) Included within the change in Other assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows offset by non-cash operating lease right-of-use asset\namortization and lease liability accretion.\n(b) Includes right-of-use assets of approximately $21.8 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 associated with the lease commencement of our Atlanta, Georgia\ncorporate office.\n4. Papa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc.\nPJMF, which is a consolidated variable interest entity where the Company has been identified as the primary beneficiary, collects a percentage of revenues\nfrom Company-owned and franchised restaurants in the United States, for the purpose of designing and administering advertising and promotional\nprograms for all participating Domestic restaurants. Contributions and expenditures are reported on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations within Other revenues and Other expenses. PJMF also has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Papa Card, Inc., which administers the Company’s gift\ncard programs.\n64\nTable of Contents\nAssets and liabilities of PJMF, which are utilized solely for the Company’s advertising and promotional programs, were as follows in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets (in thousands):\nDecember 25, December 26,\n2022 2021\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 17,174 $ 24,481\nAccounts receivable, net 14,780 14,150\nIncome tax receivable — 300\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,815 1,718\nTotal current assets 33,769 40,649\nDeferred income taxes 655 614\nTotal assets $ 34,424 $ 41,263\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 12,428 $ 140\nIncome and other taxes payable 8 2\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 17,928 40,154\nCurrent deferred revenue 4,395 4,317\nTotal current liabilities 34,759 44,613\nDeferred revenue 2,503 2,478\nTotal liabilities $ 37,262 $ 47,091\n5. Revenue Recognition\nContract Balances\nOur contract liabilities primarily relate to franchise fees, unredeemed gift card liabilities, and loyalty program obligations, which we classify as Deferred\nrevenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, the Company recognized $33.4 million\nand $36.3 million in revenue, respectively, related to deferred revenue.\nThe following table includes a breakout of contract liability balances (in thousands):\nContract Liabilities\nDecember 25, 2022 December 26, 2021 Change\nFranchise fees and unredeemed gift card liabilities $ 30,710 $ 20,410 $ 10,300\nCustomer loyalty program obligations 13,766 15,136 (1,370)\nTotal contract liabilities $ 44,476 $ 35,546 $ 8,930\nOur contract assets consist primarily of equipment incentives provided to franchisees. Equipment incentives are related to the future value of commissary\nrevenue the Company will receive over the term of the incentive agreement. As of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, the contract assets were\napproximately $4.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively. For the years ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, revenue was reduced\napproximately $3.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively, for the amortization of contract assets over the applicable contract terms. Contract assets are\nincluded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n65\nTable of Contents\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\nThe following table (in thousands) includes estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are\nunsatisfied at the end of the reporting period.\nPerformance Obligations by Period\nLess than 1 Year 1-2 Years 2-3 Years 3-4 Years 4-5 Years Thereafter Total\nFranchise fees $ 3,098 $ 2,927 $ 2,755 $ 2,524 $ 2,210 $ 7,120 $ 20,634\nApproximately $3.2 million of area development fees related to unopened stores and International unearned royalties are included in Deferred revenue.\nTiming of revenue recognition is dependent upon the timing of store openings and franchisees’ revenues. Gift card liabilities of approximately $6.9 million,\nincluded in Deferred revenue, will be recognized in Company-owned restaurant revenues when gift cards are redeemed. The Company will recognize\nredemption fee revenue in Other revenues when cards are redeemed at franchised restaurant locations.\nThe Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have\noriginal expected durations of one year or less.\n6. Stockholders’ Deficit\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has authorized 100.0 million shares of common stock as of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively. The Company’s\noutstanding shares of common stock, net of repurchased common stock held as treasury stock, were 34.7 million shares at December 25, 2022 and 35.8\nmillion shares at December 26, 2021.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn October 28, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with an indefinite duration for up to $425.0 million of the Company’s\ncommon stock. This share repurchase program operated alongside our previous $75.0 million share repurchase authorization, which began on November 4,\n2020 and expired on December 26, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase activity for the years ended December 25, 2022, December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively:\nMaximum Dollar\nTotal Average Aggregate Value of Shares\n(In thousands, except average price per share) Numbe r Price Cost of that May Yet Be\nof Shares Paid pe r Shares Purchased Under t he\nYear Ended Purchased Share Purchase d Plans or Programs\nDecember 25, 2022 1,343 $ 93.07 $ 125,000 $ 299,800\nDecember 26, 2021 594 $ 121.96 $ 72,499 $ 424,800\nDecember 27, 2020 32 $ 83.90 $ 2,701 $ 72,299\nSubsequent to year-end, we acquired an additional 319,307 shares at an aggregate cost of $27.6 million. Approximately $272.2 million remained available\nunder the Company’s share repurchase program as of February 16, 2023.\nThe timing and volume of share repurchases under the Company’s share repurchase programs may be executed at the discretion of management on an\nopportunistic basis, subject to market and business conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors, or pursuant to trading plans or other\narrangements. Repurchases under the programs may be made through open market, block, and privately negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1\nplans, at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. Repurchases under the Company’s share repurchase programs may be commenced\nor suspended from time to time at the Company’s discretion without prior notice. Funding for the share repurchase programs will be provided through our\ncredit facility, operating cash flow, stock option exercises and cash and cash equivalents.\n66\nTable of Contents\nDividends on Common Stock\nThe Company paid dividends of approximately $54.8 million ($1.54 per share), $40.4 million and $29.4 million to common stockholders for the years\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOn January 26, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2023 dividend of $0.42 per common share, representing a $14.6 million aggregate\ndividend that was paid on February 17, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 6, 2023. The declaration and payment of any\nfuture dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company has authorized 5.0 million shares of preferred stock (of which none were issued or outstanding at December 25, 2022 or December 26, 2021,\nrespectively).\nOn May 11, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Repurchase Agreement with certain funds affiliated with, or managed by, Starboard Value LP\n(collectively, “Starboard”), pursuant to which (i) the Company repurchased from Starboard 78,387 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par\nvalue $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Series B Preferred Stock”) and (ii) Starboard converted the remaining 171,613 shares of Series B Preferred Stock\nthat it owned into 3,458,360 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation of the Series B Preferred Stock.\nOn June 3, 2021, the Company entered into agreements with certain franchisee investors to repurchase 1,000 shares of the outstanding Series B Preferred\nStock and convert the remaining 1,530 shares of Series B Preferred Stock into 30,769 shares of common stock. The Company paid Starboard and the\nfranchisee investors aggregate one-time cash payments of $188.6 million for the repurchase and conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Series B\nPreferred Stock. The excess of the cash payment over the carrying value of the respective Series B Preferred Stock redeemed resulted in $109.9 million of\ndividends on redemption of Series B Preferred Stock in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, which reduced net income attributable to common\nstockholders and also reduced diluted earnings per share by $3.10 for the year ended December 26, 2021.\nOn August 3, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Elimination (the “Certificate of Elimination”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to\neliminate the Series B Preferred Stock. Effective upon filing, the Certificate of Elimination eliminated from the Company’s Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation all matters set forth in the Certificate of Designation with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock. The shares that were\ndesignated to such series were returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company,\nwithout designation as to series. As a result of the repurchase and conversion, there were no shares of Series B Preferred Stock authorized or outstanding at\nDecember 25, 2022 or December 26, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes changes to our Series B Preferred Stock in 2021 (in thousands):\nBalance at December 27, 2020 $ 251,901\nAccretion 629\nRedemption (252,530)\nBalance at December 26, 2021 $ —\nDividends on Series B Preferred Stock\nThe Company paid common stock “pass-through” dividends on an as-converted basis to Series B Preferred Stockholders of $1.1 million and $4.6 million\nand preferred dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock of $3.0 million and $9.1 million, in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company also paid $1.5\nmillion of common stock deemed dividend distributions in connection with the repurchase and conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock in 2021.\n7. Earnings per Share\nWe compute earnings per share using the two-class method. The two-class method requires an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per\nshare for common shareholders and participating security holders according to dividends declared and participating rights in undistributed earnings. The\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock, which were repurchased by the Company or converted into shares of common stock during the second quarter of 2021,\nand time-based restricted stock awards are participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights and participate in\nundistributed earnings with common stock. Under the two-class method, total dividends provided to the holders of\n67\nTable of Contents\nparticipating securities and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, are subtracted from net income attributable to the Company in\ndetermining net income attributable to common shareholders. Additionally, any accretion to the redemption value for the Series B Preferred Stock or cash\npayments in excess of their respective carrying values upon redemption was treated as a deemed dividend in the two-class earnings per share calculation.\nBasic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares\noutstanding. Diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing the net income attributable to common shareholders by the diluted weighted\naverage common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding consist of basic weighted average common shares outstanding\nplus weighted average awards outstanding under our equity compensation plans, which are dilutive securities.\nThe calculations of basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 25, 2022, December 26, 2021\nand December 27, 2020 are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\n2022 2021 2020\nBasic earnings per common share\nNet income attributable to the Company $ 67,772 $ 120,016 $ 57,932\nDividends on redemption of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock — (109,852) —\nDividends paid to participating securities (306) (6,091) (14,059)\nNet income attributable to participating securities (104) — (2,136)\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 67,362 $ 4,073 $ 41,737\nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding 35,497 35,007 32,421\nBasic earnings per common share $ 1.90 $ 0.12 $ 1.29\nDiluted earnings per common share\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 67,362 $ 4,073 $ 41,737\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 35,497 35,007 32,421\nDilutive effect of outstanding equity awards (a) 220 330 296\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding (b) 35,717 35,337 32,717\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 1.89 $ 0.12 $ 1.28\n______________________________\n(a) Shares subject to options to purchase common stock with an exercise price greater than the average market price for the year were not included in the computation of\ndiluted earnings per common share because the effect would have been antidilutive. The weighted average number of shares subject to antidilutive options was 100,000\nin 2020 (none in 2022 or 2021).\n(b) The Company had 252,500 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 27, 2020 (none as of December 25, 2022 or December 26, 2021). For the\nfully diluted calculation, the Series B Preferred Stock dividends were added back to net income attributable to common shareholders. The Company then applied the if-\nconverted method to calculate dilution on the Series B Preferred Stock, which resulted in 5.0 million additional common shares. This calculation was anti-dilutive in\n2020 and as such was excluded.\nSee “Note 20. Equity Compensation” for additional information regarding our equity awards, including restricted stock.\n8. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\nThe Company determines the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the\nliability to a market participant. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are required to be classified and disclosed\nin one of the following three categories:\n• Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\n68\nTable of Contents\nFair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity specific measurement. Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair\nvalue; accordingly, the fair values presented do not necessarily indicate what the Company or its debtholders could realize in a current market exchange.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021 are as follows:\nFair Value Measurements\nCarrying\n(in thousands) Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDecember 25, 2022\nFinancial assets:\nCash surrender value of life insurance policies (a) $ 30,120 $ 30,120 $ — $ —\nInterest rate swaps (b) $ 986 $ — $ 986 $ —\nDecember 26, 2021\nFinancial assets:\nCash surrender value of life insurance policies (a) $ 41,904 $ 41,904 $ — $ —\nFinancial liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps (b) $ 5,536 $ — $ 5,536 $ —\n______________________________\n(a) Represents life insurance policies held in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. See “Note 21. Employee Benefit Plans” for additional information.\n(b) The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based on the sum of all future net present value cash flows. The future cash flows are derived based on the terms of our\ninterest rate swaps, as well as considering published discount factors, and projected London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”).\nThere were no transfers among levels within the fair value hierarchy during fiscal 2022 or 2021.\nThe fair value of certain assets and liabilities approximates carrying value because of the short-term nature of the accounts, including cash and cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, net of allowances, and accounts payable. The carrying value of notes receivable, net of allowances, also approximates fair\nvalue. The Company’s revolving credit facilities and term debt under the Company’s credit agreement approximate carrying value due to their variable\nmarket-based interest rate. The Company’s 3.875% senior notes are classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement since the Company estimates the fair\nvalue by using recent trading transactions, and have the following estimated fair values and carrying values (excluding the impact of unamortized debt\nissuance costs) as of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021:\nDecember 25, 2022 December 26, 2021\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair\n(in thousands) Value Value Value Value\n3.875% Senior Notes $ 400,000 $ 339,500 $ 400,000 $ 396,000\n9. Noncontrolling Interests\nAs of December 25, 2022, the Company had three joint venture arrangements comprising 98 restaurants as compared to four joint venture arrangements\ncomprising 188 restaurants at December 26, 2021. As further described in “Note 22. Divestitures,” the Company divested its 51 percent interest in one joint\nventure that owned 90 restaurants in the second quarter of 2022.\n69\nTable of Contents\nNet income attributable to these joint ventures for the years ended December 25, 2022, December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020 was as follows (in\nthousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nPapa John’s International, Inc. $ 3,136 $ 8,457 $ 5,654\nNoncontrolling interests 1,577 4,939 2,682\nTotal net income $ 4,713 $ 13,396 $ 8,336\nThe following summarizes changes in our redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nBalance at December 27, 2020 $ 6,474\nNet income 2,609\nDistributions (3,585)\nBalance at December 26, 2021 $ 5,498\nNet income 574\nDistributions (4,855)\nBalance at December 25, 2022 $ 1,217\n10. Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,”\n(“ASU 2016-13”) as of December 30, 2019 (the first day of fiscal 2020) under the modified retrospective transition method. Topic 326 requires\nmeasurement and recognition of expected versus incurred losses for financial assets held. Financial instruments subject to Topic 326 include trade accounts\nreceivable, notes receivable and interest receivable (classified as Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets) from franchisees. The impact of the\nadoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nEstimates of expected credit losses, even if remote, are based upon historical account write-off trends, facts about the current financial condition of the\ndebtor, forecasts of future operating results based upon current trends of select operating metrics, and macroeconomic factors. Credit quality is monitored\nthrough the timing of payments compared to the prescribed payment terms and known facts regarding the financial condition of the franchisee or customer.\nAccount and note balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased.\nThe following table summarizes changes in our allowances for credit losses for accounts receivable and notes receivable:\n(In thousands) Accounts Receivable Notes Receivable\nBalance at December 27, 2020 $ 3,622 $ 3,211\nCurrent period provision (benefit) for expected credit losses 16 (583)\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance (1,274) (843)\nRecoveries collected — (285)\nBalance at December 26, 2021 $ 2,364 $ 1,500\nCurrent period provision for expected credit losses (a) 6,474 14,066\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance (2,120) (1,042)\nRecoveries collected — (25)\nBalance at December 25, 2022 $ 6,718 $ 14,499\n______________________________\n(a) The Company recorded $14.6 million of one-time, non-cash reserves in the first quarter of 2022 for certain accounts receivable and notes receivable primarily associated\nwith a master franchisee with operations principally in Russia.

Debt\nLong-term debt, net consists of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 25, December 26,\n2022 2021\nSenior notes $ 400,000 $ 400,000\nRevolving facilities 205,000 90,000\nOutstanding debt 605,000 490,000\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (7,931) (9,270)\nTotal long-term debt, net $ 597,069 $ 480,730\nSenior Notes\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company issued $400.0 million of 3.875% senior notes (the “Notes”) which will mature on September 15, 2029. The Notes\nare guaranteed by each of the Company’s existing and future Domestic restricted subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers under the Amended Credit\nAgreement (as defined below) or other certain indebtedness. The Notes were offered and sold either to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified\ninstitutional buyers” pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or to persons outside the United States\nunder Regulation S of the Securities Act. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year,\nbeginning March 15, 2022, at a fixed interest rate of 3.875% per annum. In connection with the Notes, the Company recorded $7.1 million of debt issuance\ncosts, which are being amortized into net interest expense over the term of the Notes.\nThe net proceeds from the Notes, together with borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below), were used to repay outstanding\nrevolver and term loan borrowings under the Company’s Previous Credit Agreement (as defined below).\nThe Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after September 15, 2024 at established redemption prices ranging from 97 to\n194 basis points depending on when the Notes are redeemed. At any time prior to September 15, 2024, the Company may also redeem up to 40% of the\nNotes with net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 103.875% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus\naccrued and unpaid interest, excluding the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to September 15, 2024, the Company may\n71\nTable of Contents\nredeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid\ninterest and an applicable “make-whole” premium. The Notes also contain customary redemption provisions related to asset sales and certain change of\ncontrol transactions.\nThe Indenture governing the Notes contains customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default, failure to comply with covenants\nor agreements contained in the Indenture or the Notes and certain provisions related to bankruptcy events. The Indenture also contains customary negative\ncovenants.\nAmended Credit Agreement\nConcurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”)\nreplacing the previous credit agreement (“Previous Credit Agreement”). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit\nfacility in an aggregate available principal amount of $600.0 million (the “PJI Revolving Facility”), of which up to $40.0 million is available as swingline\nloans and up to $80.0 million is available as letters of credit. The PJI Revolving Facility will mature on September 14, 2026. In connection with the\nAmended Credit Agreement, the Company recorded $2.1 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized into net interest expense over the term\nof the Amended Credit Agreement. The remaining availability under the PJI Revolving Facility was $395.0 million as of December 25, 2022.\nUp to $50.0 million of the PJI Revolving Facility may be advanced in certain agreed foreign currencies, including Euros, Pounds Sterling, Canadian\nDollars, Japanese Yen, and Mexican Pesos. Additionally, the Amended Credit Agreement includes an accordion feature allowing for a future increase of the\nPJI Revolving Facility and/or incremental term loans in an aggregate amount of up to $500.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining\ncommitments from one or more new or existing lenders to provide such increased amounts and ongoing compliance with financial covenants.\nLoans under the PJI Revolving Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company’s election, either a LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging\nfrom 1.25% to 2.00% or a base rate (generally determined according to the greater of a prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or a LIBOR rate plus\n1.00%) plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00%. In each case, the actual margin is determined according to a ratio of the Company’s total indebtedness\nto an earnings calculation, Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in our credit agreement), for the then most recently ended four quarter period (the “Leverage\nRatio”). An unused commitment fee ranging from 18 to 30 basis points per annum, determined according to the Leverage Ratio, applies to the\nunderutilized commitments under the PJI Revolving Facility. Loans outstanding under the PJI Revolving Facility may be prepaid at any time without\npremium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs in the case of borrowings for which a LIBOR rate election is in effect. The Amended Credit\nAgreement also contain provisions specifying alternative interest rate calculations to be used at such time as LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark\nfor establishing the interest rate on floating interest rate borrowings.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, require customary reporting obligations,\nand restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, the consummation of certain mergers, consolidations, sales of\nassets and similar transactions, the making of investments, equity distributions and other restricted payments, and transactions with affiliates. The Company\nis subject to the following financial covenants: (1) a maximum Leverage Ratio of 5.25 to 1.00, subject to the Company’s election to increase the maximum\nLeverage Ratio by 0.50 to 1.00 in connection with material acquisitions if the Company satisfies certain requirements, and (2) a minimum interest coverage\nratio defined as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in our credit agreement) plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated interest expense plus\nconsolidated rental expense of 2.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with these financial covenants at December 25, 2022.\nObligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain direct and indirect material Domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the\n“Guarantors”) and are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the capital stock and equity interests of the Company’s and the Guarantors’\nDomestic and first tier material foreign subsidiaries. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default including, among other things,\npayment defaults, breach of covenants, cross acceleration to material indebtedness, bankruptcy-related defaults, judgment defaults, and the occurrence of\ncertain change of control events. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the termination of the PJI Revolving Facility, acceleration of\nrepayment obligations and the exercise of remedies by the Lenders with respect to the Guarantors.\nPJMF Revolving Facility\nPJMF has a $20.0 million revolving line of credit (the “PJMF Revolving Facility”) pursuant to a Revolving Loan Agreement, dated September 30, 2015\nwith U.S. Bank National Association, as lender. The PJMF Revolving Facility is\n72\nTable of Contents\nsecured by substantially all assets of PJMF. The PJMF Revolving Facility matures on September 30, 2023, but is subject to annual amendments. The\nborrowings under the PJMF Revolving Facility accrue interest at a variable rate of the one-month LIBOR plus 1.60%. There was no debt outstanding under\nthe PJMF Revolving Facility as of December 25, 2022 or December 26, 2021. The PJMF operating results and the related debt outstanding do not impact\nthe financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nAs of December 25, 2022, we have the following interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $125.0 million:\nEffective Dates Floating Rate Debt Fixed Rates\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 55 million 2.33 %\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 35 million 2.36 %\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 35 million 2.34 %\nIn 2021, our interest rate swaps were de-designated as cash flow hedges following the issuance of the Notes and remained undesignated as hedges through\nJune 26, 2022. For these de-designated hedges, the portion of gains or losses on the derivative instruments previously recognized in AOCL will be\nreclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the originally hedged transactions.\nAs of June 27, 2022, the interest rate swaps were re-designated as cash flow hedges to provide a hedge against changes in variable rate cash flows\nregarding fluctuations in the LIBOR rate utilized on the revolving credit facility. Therefore, beginning in the third quarter of 2022, our interest rate swaps\nare accounted for utilizing cash flow hedge accounting treatment. The interest rate swaps are marked to market at each reporting date and any unrealized\ngains or losses are included in AOCL and reclassified to interest expense in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect\nearnings.\nWe recognized income of $4.8 million ($3.7 million after tax) in 2022 and $6.8 million ($5.3 million after tax) in 2021, and a loss of $7.5 million ($5.8\nmillion after tax) in 2020 in other comprehensive income (loss) for the net change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps.\nThe following table provides information on the location and amounts of our swaps in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands):\nInterest Rate Swap Derivatives\nFair Value Fair Value\nDecember 25 , December 26 ,\nBalance Sheet Location 2022 2021\nOther current and long-term assets $ 986 $ —\nOther current and long-term liabilities $ — $ 5,536\nAs of December 25, 2022, the portion of the aggregate $1.0 million interest rate swap liability that would be reclassified into interest expense during the\nnext twelve months approximates $1.0 million.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe effect of derivative instruments on the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements is as follows (in thousands):\nLocation of (Loss) Amount of (Loss)\nDerivatives - Amount of Gain or or Gain or Gain Total Interest Expense\nCash Flow (Loss) Recognized Reclassified f rom Reclassified f rom on Consolidated\nHedging in AOCL AOCL into AOCL into Statements of\nRelationshi ps on Derivativ e Income Income Operations\nInterest rate swaps:\n2022 $ 3,663 Interest expense $ (2,384) $ (26,653)\n2021 $ 5,273 Interest expense $ (5,965) $ (19,205)\n2020 $ (5,788) Interest expense $ (5,068) $ (17,022)\nInterest paid, including payments made or received under the swaps, was $24.4 million, $13.4 million and $15.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n13.

Strategic Corporate Reorganization for Long-term Growth\nOn September 17, 2020, we announced plans to open an office in Atlanta, Georgia located in Three Ballpark Center at The Battery Atlanta, which opened\nin October 2021. The space is designed to drive continued menu innovation and optimize integration across marketing, communications, customer\nexperience, operations, human resources, diversity, equity and inclusion, financial planning and analysis, investor relations and development functions. Our\ninformation technology, finance, supply chain, and legal teams continue to operate in our Louisville, Kentucky office, which remains critical to our success.\nWe also maintain an office outside of London, UK, where our International operations are managed. Employees whose positions were relocated to the new\nAtlanta office were either offered an opportunity to continue with the organization or were offered a severance package. As a result, we incurred one-time\ncorporate reorganization costs of approximately $13.1 million and $6.0 million through December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively, as\ndetailed in the table below (in thousands).

Our ability to utilize these state deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate\nearnings in future years in the respective state jurisdictions. The Company provided a full valuation allowance of $10.2 million and $8.8 million for these\nstate deferred tax assets as we believe realization based on the more-likely-than-not criteria has not been met as of December 25, 2022 and December 26,\n2021, respectively.\nThe Company had approximately $2.0 million and $1.4 million of state deferred tax assets related to state income tax credit carryforwards as of\nDecember 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively.

Our ability to utilize these foreign tax credit\ncarryforwards is dependent on our ability to generate foreign earnings in future years sufficient to claim foreign tax credits in excess of foreign taxes paid\nin those years. The Company provided a full valuation allowance of $20.2 million and $18.6 million for these foreign tax credit carryforwards as we\nbelieve realization based on the more-likely-than-not criteria has not been met as of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively.\nCash for income taxes paid were $11.7 million in 2022, $32.6 million in 2021 and $19.3 million in 2020.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.

Pursuant to the Original Endorsement Agreement, the Company received the right and license to use Mr. O’Neal’s name,\nnickname, initials, autograph, voice, video or film portrayals, photograph, likeness and certain other intellectual property rights (individually and\ncollectively, the “Personality Rights”), in each case, solely as approved by ABG-Shaq, in connection with the advertising, promotion and sale of Papa\nJohn’s-branded products. Mr. O’Neal also agreed to provide brand ambassador services related to appearances, social media and public relations matters,\nand to collaborate with us to develop one or more co-branded products using the Personality Rights. Mr. O’Neal and the Company developed a co-branded\nextra-large pizza product using the Personality Rights under an amendment to the Original Endorsement Agreement signed July 27, 2020 (the “First\nAmendment”).\nAs consideration for the rights and services granted under the Original Endorsement Agreement, the Company agreed to pay to ABG-Shaq aggregate cash\npayments of $4.1 million over the three years of the Original Endorsement Agreement. The Company also paid expenses related to the marketing and\npersonal services provided by Mr. O’Neal. In addition, the Company agreed to grant 87,136 restricted stock units to Mr. O’Neal (as agent of ABG) under\nour 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan.\nOn July 29, 2021, the Company and PJMF entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “ Second Amendment”) to the Original Endorsement Agreement with\nABG-Shaq. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company was granted the ability to use the Personality Rights for a limited time to promote, advertise,\nand sell our co-branded extra-large pizza developed under the First Amendment. ABG-Shaq did not receive any additional royalty fees from the Company\nbeyond the cash payment already contemplated under the Original Endorsement Agreement under the Amendment. In addition, the Company donated one\nU.S. dollar for each unit of the pizza sold in the United States and one Canadian dollar for each unit sold in Canada to The Papa John’s Foundation for\nBuilding Community.\nOn March 15, 2022, the Original Endorsement Agreement expired by its terms. On April 10, 2022, the Company and PJMF entered into a new\nEndorsement Agreement (the “New Endorsement Agreement”), effective March 15, 2022, with ABG-Shaq, LLC (“ABG-Shaq”), to replace the Original\nEndorsement Agreement.\nThe terms of the New Endorsement Agreement are substantially similar to the Original Endorsement Agreement. As consideration for the rights and\nservices granted under the New Endorsement Agreement, the Company and PJMF agreed to pay to ABG-Shaq aggregate cash payments of $5.6 million\nover the three years of the New Endorsement Agreement. The Company and PJMF will also pay ABG-Shaq a royalty fee for the co-branded pizza product\nif the total amount of royalties in a given contract year (calculated as $0.20 per co-branded pizza sold) exceeds the contractual cash payment for that year,\nin which case the amount of the royalty payment will be the excess of the royalties over the cash payment amount. The Company did not pay ABG-Shaq\nany royalties in 2022 for the co-branded pizza promotion. The Company and PJMF will also pay expenses related to the marketing and personal services\nprovided by Mr. O’Neal.\nIn addition, the Company agreed to grant 55,898 restricted stock units (the “RSUs”) to Mr. O’Neal (as agent of ABG) under the Company’s 2018 Omnibus\nIncentive Plan. The RSUs will vest into an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s common stock according to the following vesting schedule:\n● 33% (18,632) of the RSUs will vest on April 12, 2023;\n● 33% (18,632) of the RSUs will vest on March 15, 2024; and\n● 33% (18,634) of the RSUs will vest on March 15, 2025.\nThe initial term of the New Endorsement Agreement ends on March 15, 2025, with an option for a one-year extension upon the parties’ mutual agreement.\nThe New Endorsement Agreement also includes customary exclusivity, termination and indemnification clauses.\n79\nTable of Contents\n19. Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nThe Company is involved in a number of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those specifically identified below, consisting of\nintellectual property, employment, consumer, commercial and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with ASC 450,\n“Contingencies,” the Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings,\nadvice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.\nDurling et al v. Papa John’s International, Inc., is a conditionally certified collective action filed in May 2016 in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York, alleging that corporate restaurant delivery drivers were not properly reimbursed for vehicle mileage and expenses in\naccordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act. In July 2018, the District Court granted a motion to certify a conditional corporate collective class and the\nopt-in notice process has been completed. As of the close of the opt-in period on October 29, 2018, 9,571 drivers opted into the collective class. On\nSeptember 30, 2022, the parties reached a settlement in principle to resolve the case. Pursuant to the terms of the proposed settlement, in exchange for the\nCompany’s payment of a total aggregate settlement amount of no more than $20.0 million subject to a claims-made process, all claims in the action will be\ndismissed, the litigation will be terminated, and the Company will receive a release. The proposed settlement also includes resolution of a companion case,\nHubbard, et al. v. Papa John’s International, Inc., pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. The proposed settlement\nis subject to a claims-made process whereby unclaimed funds revert to the Company, and the Company is only responsible for payments to class and\ncollective action members who timely submit a claim form. Although the return rate for timely claims is unknown and not within the Company’s control,\nthe Company estimates its actual exposure resulting from the settlement to be approximately $10.0 million and this amount was recorded in General and\nadministrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. On December 19, 2022, the District Court granted preliminary approval of the\nproposed settlement; however, the settlement remains subject to final approval by the District Court and contains certain customary contingencies.\nSubsequent to year end, the Company remitted $5.0 million to the settlement administrator as partial funding of the settlement in accordance with the terms\nof the applicable settlement agreement. The Company continues to deny any liability or wrongdoing in this matter.\nIn re Papa John’s Employee & Franchise Employee Antitrust Litigation is a putative class action filed in December 2018 in the United States District Court\nfor the Western District of Kentucky. The suit alleges that the “no-poaching” provision previously contained in the Company’s franchise agreement\nconstituted an unlawful agreement or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. On April 14,\n2022, the parties reached a settlement in principle to resolve the case. Pursuant to the terms of the proposed settlement, in exchange for the Company’s\npayment of a total aggregate settlement amount of $5.0 million and other non-monetary consideration, all claims in the action will be dismissed, the\nlitigation will be terminated, and the Company will receive a release. The settlement amount was recorded in General and administrative expenses in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. The proposed settlement is subject to approval by the District Court and contains certain customary contingencies.\nThe Company continues to deny any liability or wrongdoing in this matter.\n20. Equity Compensation\nWe award stock options, time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units from time to time under the Papa John’s International,\nInc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. There were approximately 3.6 million shares of common stock authorized for issuance and remaining available under\nthe 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan as of December 25, 2022, which includes 5.9 million shares transferred from the Papa John’s International 2011 Omnibus\nIncentive Plan.\nWe recorded stock-based employee compensation expense of $18.4 million in 2022, $16.9 million in 2021 and $16.3 million in 2020. At December 25,\n2022, there was $22.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards, of which the Company expects to recognize $14.6 million\nin 2023, $6.5 million in 2024 and $1.1 million in 2025.\nStock Options\nOptions exercised, which were issued from authorized shares, included 82,000 shares in 2022, 212,000 shares in 2021 and 541,000 shares in 2020. The\ntotal intrinsic value of the options exercised during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $3.4 million, $10.1 million and $13.8 million, respectively.\n80\nTable of Contents\nThere were no options granted in 2022, 2021 or 2020. Information pertaining to option activity during 2022 is as follows (number of options and aggregate\nintrinsic value in thousands):\nWeighted\nAverage\nWeighted Remainin g\nNumber Average Contractual Aggregate\nof Exercise Term Intrinsic\nOptio ns Price (In Year s) Value\nOutstanding at December 26, 2021 319 $ 54.65\nExercised (82) 49.48\nCancelled (2) 45.29\nOutstanding at December 25, 2022 235 $ 56.53 4.47 $ 6,452\nExercisable at December 25, 2022 235 $ 56.53 4.47 $ 6,452\nRestricted Stock\nWe granted shares of restricted stock that are time-based and generally vest in equal installments over three years (165,000 in 2022, 130,000 in 2021 and\n207,000 in 2020). Upon vesting, the shares are issued from treasury stock. These restricted shares are intended to focus participants on our long-range\nobjectives, while at the same time serving as a retention mechanism. We consider time-based restricted stock awards to be participating securities because\nholders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights. We declared dividends totaling $467,000 ($1.54 per share) in 2022, $410,000 ($1.15 per share)\nin 2021 and $366,000 ($0.90 per share) in 2020 to holders of time-based restricted stock.\nWe granted 69,000, 11,000 and 15,000 restricted stock units that are time-based and vest over a period of one to three years in 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. Upon vesting, the units are issued from treasury stock. Total dividends declared for these awards were insignificant to the results of our\noperations.\nAdditionally, we granted stock settled performance-based restricted stock units to executive management (64,000 units in 2022, 61,000 units in 2021, and\n92,000 units in 2020).\nThe performance-based restricted stock units require the achievement of certain performance and market factors, which consist of the Company’s Total\nShareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to a predetermined peer group. The grant-date fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units was\ndetermined through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model.\nThe following is a summary of the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units granted in 2022,\n2021 and 2020:\nAssumptions: 2022 2021 2020\nRisk-free interest rate 1.5 % 0.2 % 0.9 %\nExpected volatility 45.0 % 48.3 % 36.3 %\nThe risk-free interest rate for the periods within the contractual life of the performance-based restricted stock unit is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve\nin effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility was estimated using the Company’s historical share price volatility for a period similar to the expected life\nof the performance-based restricted stock unit.\nThe performance-based restricted stock units granted vest over three years (cliff vest) and are expensed over the performance period. The weighted average\ngrant-date fair value of performance-based restricted stock units granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $113.90, $103.14 and $59.52, respectively.\n81\nTable of Contents\nThe fair value of time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units is based on the market price of the Company’s shares on the grant\ndate.

Employee Benefit Plans\nWe have established the Papa John’s International, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), as a defined contribution benefit plan, in accordance with Section\n401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 401(k) Plan is open to employees who meet certain eligibility requirements and allows participating employees\nto defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and contribute such amount to one or more investment funds. In late 2021, the Company adopted a Safe\nHarbor 401k Plan effective for the 2022 benefit year.\nIn addition, we maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan available to certain employees and directors. Under this plan, the participants may\ndefer a certain amount of their compensation, which is credited to the participants’ accounts. The participant-directed investments associated with this plan\nare included in Other assets ($30.1 million and $41.9 million at December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively) and the associated liabilities\n($28.3 million and $36.2 million at December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively) are included in Other long-term liabilities in the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe contributed a matching payment of 4.0% in 2022, up to a maximum of 6.0% of a participating employee’s earnings deferred into the 401(k) Plan. At\nour discretion, the Company contributed 4.0% in 2021 and 2.1% in 2020, up to a maximum of 6.0% of a participating employee’s earnings deferred into\nboth the 401(k) Plan and the non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Such costs were $4.4 million in 2022, $3.5 million in 2021 and $1.8 million in\n2020.\n22. Divestitures\nRefranchising Loss\nOn March 28, 2022, we refranchised our 51.0% ownership interest in a 90-restaurant consolidated joint venture in Texas for $14.0 million, net of\ntransaction costs. In connection with the divestiture, we recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $8.4 million as a Refranchising Loss in the Consolidated\nStatement of Operations, which reflects net sale proceeds of $14.0 million, the noncontrolling interest of $4.2 million, and the recognition of an unearned\nroyalty stream of $12.2 million to be recognized as revenue over the 10-year term of the franchise agreement executed concurrent with the disposition in\naccordance with ASC 810, “Consolidation.” Goodwill of $9.9 million was allocated to the disposal group based on relative fair value within the Domestic\nCompany-owned restaurants reporting group. The $8.4 million of the one-time, non-cash refranchising loss was recorded in the first quarter of 2022 and\nrealized upon consummation of the sale in the second quarter.\nImpairment of Reacquired Master Franchise Rights\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded an impairment of $2.8 million for reacquired franchise rights due to the financial and operational impact\nof the conflict in Ukraine and government actions taken in response to that conflict, including, but not limited to, international sanctions. The reacquired\nfranchise rights were previously acquired from a former master franchisee and capitalized by the Company.\n82\nTable of Contents\n23. Segment Information\nWe have four reportable segments: Domestic Company-owned restaurants, North America franchising, North America commissaries, and International\noperations. The Domestic Company-owned restaurant segment consists of the operations of all Domestic Company-owned restaurants and derives its\nrevenues principally from retail sales of pizza, Papadias, which are flatbread-style sandwiches, and side items, including breadsticks, cheesesticks, chicken\npoppers and wings, dessert items and canned or bottled beverages. The North America franchising segment consists of our franchise sales and support\nactivities and derives its revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and collection of royalties from our franchisees located in the United\nStates and Canada. The North America commissary segment consists of the operations of our regional dough production and product distribution centers\nand derives its revenues principally from the sale and distribution of food and paper products to Domestic Company-owned and franchised restaurants in\nthe United States and Canada. The International segment principally consists of distribution sales to franchised Papa Johns restaurants located in the UK\nand our franchise sales and support activities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our\nInternational franchisees. International franchisees are defined as all franchise operations outside of the United States and Canada. All other business units\nthat do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments, which are not operating segments, we refer to as “all other,” which\nconsists of operations that derive revenues from the sale, principally to Company-owned and franchised restaurants, of printing and promotional items,\nfranchise contributions to marketing funds and information systems and related services used in restaurant operations, including our point-of-sale system,\nonline and other technology-based ordering platforms.\nGenerally, we evaluate performance and allocate resources based on operating income. Certain administrative and capital costs are allocated to segments\nbased upon predetermined rates or estimated resource usage. We account for intercompany sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third\nparties and eliminate the activity in consolidation.\nOur reportable segments are business units that provide different products or services. Separate management of each segment is required because each\nbusiness unit is subject to different operational issues and strategies. No single external customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues.\n83\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present our segment information.\n(In thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nRevenues:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants $ 708,389 $ 778,323 $ 700,757\nNorth America franchising 137,399 129,310 96,732\nNorth America commissaries 869,634 761,305 680,793\nInternational 158,682 184,099 150,939\nAll others 227,999 215,384 184,013\nTotal revenues $ 2,102,103 $ 2,068,421 $ 1,813,234\nIntersegment revenues:\nNorth America franchising $ 4,122 $ 4,179 $ 3,229\nNorth America commissaries 217,570 215,393 192,332\nAll others 70,283 75,366 83,635\nTotal intersegment revenues $ 291,975 $ 294,938 $ 279,196\nDepreciation and amortization:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants $ 11,495 $ 11,728 $ 11,905\nNorth America commissaries 13,299 11,974 9,660\nInternational 1,774 2,326 1,975\nAll others 12,681 9,928 10,254\nUnallocated corporate expenses 12,783 12,860 15,911\nTotal depreciation and amortization $ 52,032 $ 48,816 $ 49,705\nOperating income:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants (a) $ 15,966 $ 49,628 $ 37,049\nNorth America franchising 127,882 120,949 89,801\nNorth America commissaries 42,531 39,873 33,185\nInternational (b) 17,891 34,896 24,034\nAll others 10,084 17,704 7,043\nUnallocated corporate expenses (c) (104,419) (94,114) (100,069)\nElimination of intersegment (profits) (905) (695) (790)\nTotal operating income $ 109,030 $ 168,241 $ 90,253\n______________________________\n(a) Includes a one-time, non-cash charge of $8.4 million associated with the refranchising of the Company’s ownership interest in a 90-restaurant joint venture, recorded as\nRefranchising and impairment loss for the year ended December 25, 2022.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are effective.\n(b) Management’s Report on our Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-\n15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and the board of\ndirectors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have\ninherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement\npreparation and presentation.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission (“2013 Framework”). Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 Framework, our\nmanagement concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 25, 2022.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K and, as part of its audit, has issued an attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 25, 2022 that have materially affected, or are likely\nto materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n87\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Papa John’s International, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Papa John’s International, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nFramework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Papa John’s International, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2022\nconsolidated financial statements of the Company, and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “Management’s Report on our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.” Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nLouisville, Kentucky\nFebruary 23, 2023\n88\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.

Business\nGeneral\nPapa John’s International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as the “Company”, “Papa John’s” or in the first person\nnotations of “we”, “us” and “our”), operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants and, in certain\ninternational markets, dine-in and delivery restaurants under the trademark “Papa John’s”. Papa John’s began operations\nin 1984. At December 26, 2021, there were 5,650 Papa John’s restaurants in operation, consisting of 600 Company-owned\nand 5,050 franchised restaurants operating in 50 countries and territories. Our Company-owned restaurants include 188\nrestaurants operated under four joint venture arrangements. All of the 2,311 international restaurants are franchised.\nStrategy\nWe are committed to delivering on our brand promise “BETTER INGREDIENTS. BETTER PIZZA.®” and a business\nstrategy designed to drive sustainable long-term, profitable growth.\nWe believe that using high quality ingredients leads to superior quality pizzas. Our original crust pizza dough is made\nfrom six simple ingredients and is fresh, never frozen. We also top our pizzas with real cheese made from mozzarella,\npizza sauce made with vine-ripened tomatoes, and meat free of fillers. Our marketing and menu strategies emphasize the\nquality of our ingredients and our new product innovations to accelerate sales. One of our most recent menu innovations,\nthe new Epic Stuffed Crust pizza, was officially launched in the first quarter of 2021 and has been one of our most\nsuccessful launches to date. The Epic Stuffed Crust pizza, and other menu innovations like our recently announced New\nYork Style pizza, along with Garlic Parmesan Crust, toasted handheld “Papadias” flatbread-style sandwiches and Jalapeno\nPopper Rolls launched in 2020, demonstrates our commitment to building new long-term sustainable menu products on\nwhich we can continue to innovate. These products form the foundation of our growing comparable sales and improving\nunit economics.\nWe utilize technology to deliver a better customer experience, improve operational efficiencies and inform our decision-\nmaking. Our loyalty program (“Papa Rewards”) and one-to-one marketing platforms help us retain loyal customers and\nattract new ones. As our loyalty program grows, it continues to deliver strategic benefits. Papa Rewards customers are\nsignificantly more profitable than non-loyalty customers since we are able to directly engage them with targeted\npersonalized offers that drive higher frequency, ticket price and satisfaction. We also partner with top domestic delivery\naggregators to meet customer demand for our products. Aggregators have also helped navigate the labor shortage that the\nCompany is experiencing by providing supplemental delivery drivers, especially during peak times when our delivery\nteams are working at full capacity.\nWe continue to pursue a growth strategy by expanding our footprint, both domestically and internationally. In August\n2021, we announced our expanded partnership with Drake Food Service International to open over 220 restaurants across\nLatin America, Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom (“UK”) by 2025. In September 2021, we announced the\nCompany's largest domestic development deal ever with Sun Holdings, who will open 100 new locations in high-growth\nmarkets in Texas and the South by 2029. Most recently, in January 2022, we announced a partnership with FountainVest\nPartners, one of Asia’s leading independent private equity firms, to open more than 1,350 new stores across South China\nby 2040, the largest franchisee development agreement in our history.\nA large majority of Papa John’s restaurants are franchised. We believe a franchised model provides resiliency of earnings\nand presents us with an opportunity to enhance growth with less capital investment than a traditional company-operated\nrestaurant model. We seek to attract and retain franchisees with experience in restaurant or retail operations and with the\nfinancial resources and management capabilities to open single or multiple locations. While each Papa John’s franchisee\nmanages and operates its own restaurants and business, we devote significant resources to providing franchisees with\nassistance in restaurant operations, quality assurance, technology, training, marketing, site selection and restaurant design.\nPapa John’s franchise owners benefit from our award-winning brand, food service capabilities and the Papa John’s digital\nand delivery model.\n3\nSegment Overview\nPapa John’s has four defined reportable segments: Domestic Company-owned restaurants, North America commissaries\n(Quality Control Centers), North America franchising and International operations.\nDomestic Company-owned Restaurants\nThe Domestic Company-owned restaurant segment consists of the operations of all domestic Company-owned restaurants\n(“domestic” is defined as the contiguous United States) and derives its revenues principally from retail sales of pizza,\nPapadias, and side items, including breadsticks, cheesesticks, chicken poppers and wings, dessert items and canned or\nbottled beverages.\nOf the total 3,339 North American restaurants open as of December 26, 2021, 600 units, or approximately 18%, were\nCompany-owned. In 2021, the 579 domestic Company-owned restaurants included in the full year’s comparable restaurant\nbase generated average annual unit sales of $1.3 million. We are committed to maintaining sound restaurant unit\neconomics.\nOperating Company-owned restaurants allows us to improve operations, training, marketing and quality standards for the\nbenefit of the entire Papa John’s system.\nNorth America commissary\nThe North America commissary segment comprises 11 full-service regional dough production and distribution Quality\nControl Centers (“QC Centers”) in the United States (“U.S.”), which supply pizza sauce, dough, food products, paper\nproducts, smallwares and cleaning supplies twice weekly to each traditional restaurant served. This system enables us to\nmonitor and control product quality and consistency while lowering food and other costs. We also have one QC Center in\nCanada, which produces and distributes fresh dough. We evaluate the QC Center system capacity in relation to existing\nrestaurants’ volumes and planned restaurant growth, and facilities are developed or upgraded as operational or economic\nconditions warrant. To ensure consistent food quality, each domestic franchisee is required to purchase dough and pizza\nsauce from our QC Centers and to purchase all other supplies from our QC Centers or other approved suppliers.\nNorth America franchising\nThe North America franchising segment consists of our franchise sales and support activities and derives its revenues from\nthe sale of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our franchisees located in the United\nStates and Canada. Our North American franchised restaurants, which included 2,384 restaurants in the full year’s\ncomparable base for 2021, generated average annual unit sales of $1.1 million. These sales, while not included in the\nCompany’s revenues, contribute to our royalty revenues, franchisee marketing fund contributions, and commissary\nrevenue.\nInternational\nThe International segment principally consists of distribution sales to franchised Papa John’s restaurants located in the UK\nand our franchise sales and support activities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and\nthe collection of royalties from our international franchisees. International franchisees are defined as all franchise\noperations outside of the United States and Canada. As of December 26, 2021, there were 2,311 international restaurants,\nall of which are franchised. The Company currently operates one international QC Center, which is in the UK. Other QC\nCenters outside the U.S. are operated by franchisees pursuant to license agreements or by other third parties.\nAll others\nAll other business units that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments, which are not\noperating segments, we refer to as “all others”. These consist of operations that derive revenues from franchise\ncontributions to our marketing funds and the sale, principally to Company-owned and franchised restaurants, of\n4\ninformation systems and related services used in restaurant operations, including our point-of-sale system, online and other\ntechnology-based ordering platforms, and printing and promotional items.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 22” of “Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements” for financial information about our segments.\nDevelopment\nAt December 26, 2021, there were 5,650 Papa John’s restaurants operating in 50 countries and territories, as follows:\nDomestic Franchised\nCompany- North Total North\nowned America America International System-wide\nBeginning - December 27, 2020 588 2,701 3,289 2,111 5,400\nOpened 11 74 85 304 389\nClosed — (35) (35) (104) (139)\nAcquired 1 — 1 — 1\nSold — (1) (1) — (1)\nEnding - December 26, 2021 600 2,739 3,339 2,311 5,650\nNet unit growth 12 38 50 200 250\nAlthough most of our domestic Company-owned markets are well-penetrated, our Company-owned restaurant growth\nstrategy is to continue to open domestic restaurants in existing markets as appropriate, thereby increasing consumer\nawareness and enabling us to take advantage of operational and marketing scale efficiencies. Our experience in developing\nmarkets indicates that market penetration through the opening of multiple restaurants in a particular market results in\nincreased average restaurant sales in that market over time. We have co-developed domestic markets with some franchisees\nor divided markets among franchisees and will continue to use market co-development in the future, where appropriate.\nFranchise Program\nWe continue to attract qualified and experienced franchisees, whom we consider to be a vital part of our system’s continued\ngrowth. We believe our relationship with our franchisees is fundamental to the performance of our brand and we strive to\nmaintain a collaborative relationship with our franchisees. Franchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant’s\nbusiness background, restaurant operating experience and financial resources.\nNorth America Development and Franchise Agreements. We enter into development agreements with our franchisees in\nNorth America for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified\ngeographic area. The franchise agreement is generally executed once a franchisee secures a location. Our current standard\nfranchise agreement requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 5% of sales, and the majority of our existing franchised\nrestaurants have a 5% contractual royalty rate in effect. Incentives offered from time to time, including new store\nincentives, will reduce the contractual royalty rate paid. We provided financial assistance for traditional North America\nfranchisees in 2020 and 2019 in the form of lower royalties, royalty-based service incentives, and targeted relief as well\nas additional contributions to Papa John’s Marketing Fund (“PJMF”). This temporary franchisee assistance program\nconcluded in the third quarter of 2020.\nOver the past several years, we have offered various development incentive programs for domestic franchisees to\naccelerate unit openings. Such incentives included the following for 2021 traditional openings: (1) waiver of all or part of\nthe standard one-time franchise fee; (2) waiver of all or part of the 5% royalty fee for a period of time; (3) credit for new\nstore equipment; and (4) credit to be applied toward a future food purchase, under certain circumstances. We believe\ndevelopment incentive programs have accelerated unit openings, and we expect to continue to utilize such development\nincentives.\n5\nSubstantially all existing franchise agreements have an initial 10-year term with a 10-year renewal option. We have the\nright to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons, including a franchisee’s failure to make payments when\ndue or failure to adhere to our operational policies and standards. Many state franchise laws limit our ability as a franchisor\nto terminate or refuse to renew a franchise.\nInternational Development and Franchise Agreements. In international markets, we have either a development agreement\nor a master franchise agreement with a franchisee for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined\nperiod of time and specified geographic area. Under a master franchise agreement, the franchisee has the right to sub-\nfranchise a portion of the development to one or more sub-franchisees approved by us.\nOur current standard international master franchise and development agreements provide for payment to us of a royalty\nfee of 5% of sales. For international markets with sub-franchise agreements, the effective sub-franchise royalty received\nby the Company is generally 3% of sales and the master franchisee generally receives a royalty of 2% of sales. The\nremaining terms applicable to the operation of individual restaurants are substantially equivalent to the terms of our\ndomestic franchise agreement. Development agreements will be negotiated at other-than-standard terms for fees and\nroyalties, and we may offer various development and royalty incentives to help drive unit growth and results.\nFranchise Operations. All franchisees are required to operate their Papa John’s restaurants in compliance with our policies,\nstandards and specifications, including matters such as menu items, ingredients, and restaurant design. Franchisees have\nfull discretion in human resource practices, and generally have full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to\ncustomers, but we generally have the authority to set maximum price points for nationally advertised promotions.\nFranchisee Loans. Selected domestic and international franchisees have borrowed funds from us, principally for the\npurchase of restaurants from us or other franchisees or, in certain international markets, for construction and development\nof new restaurants. Loans made to franchisees can bear interest at fixed or floating rates and in most cases are secured by\nthe fixtures, equipment and signage of the restaurant and/or are guaranteed by the franchise owners. At December 26,\n2021, net loans outstanding totaled $47.9 million. See “Note 2” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for\nadditional information.\nMarketing Programs\nOur domestic marketing strategy consists of both national and local components. Our national strategy includes national\nadvertising via television, print, direct mail, digital, mobile marketing and social media channels. Our digital marketing\nactivities have increased significantly over the past several years in response to increasing customer use of online and\nmobile technology. Local advertising programs include television, radio, print, direct mail, store-to-door flyers, digital,\nmobile marketing and local social media channels.\nDomestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s restaurants within a defined market may be required to join an area\nadvertising cooperative (“Co-op”). Each member restaurant contributes a percentage of sales to the Co-op for market-wide\nprograms, such as television, radio, digital and print advertising, and sports sponsorships. The rate of contribution and uses\nof the monies collected are determined by a majority vote of the Co-op’s members.\nThe restaurant-level and Co-op marketing efforts are supported by media, print, digital and electronic advertising materials\nthat are produced by PJMF, our national marketing fund. PJMF is a consolidated nonstock corporation, designed to operate\nat break-even for the purpose of designing and administering advertising and promotional programs for all participating\ndomestic restaurants. PJMF produces and buys air time for Papa John’s national television commercials and advertises the\nCompany’s products through digital media including banner advertising, paid search-engine advertising, mobile\nmarketing, social media advertising and marketing, text messaging, and email. PJMF also engages in other brand-building\nactivities, such as consumer research and public relations activities. Domestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s\nrestaurants are required to contribute a certain minimum percentage of sales to PJMF.\nIn international markets, our marketing focuses on reaching customers who live or work within a small radius of a Papa\nJohn’s restaurant. Our international markets use a combination of advertising strategies, including television, radio, print,\ndigital, mobile marketing and local social media depending on the size of the local market.\n6\nHuman Capital\nOur team members are critical to our success. As of December 26, 2021, we employed approximately 14,000 persons, of\nwhom approximately 11,500 were team members at Company-owned restaurants, approximately 700 were management\npersonnel at Company-owned restaurants, approximately 700 were corporate personnel and approximately 1,100 were QC\nCenter and our print and promotions subsidiary personnel. Our team members are non-unionized, and most restaurant team\nmembers work part-time and are paid on an hourly basis.\nOur franchisees are independent business owners, so their employees are not our employees and therefore are not included\nin our employee count. We estimate the total number of persons in the Papa John’s system, including our team members,\nfranchisees and the team members of franchisees, was approximately 115,000 as of December 26, 2021.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nOur commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is rooted in our belief that having a Papa John's family that fully reflects\nand celebrates the global nature of our brand is the right way to do business. After being recognized by Forbes in 2021 as\none of America's Best Employers for Diversity, Papa John's joined Forbes' annual list of the World's Best employers. We\nwere honored to rank #1 amongst all pizza companies and #2 in the entire restaurant category. Also, for the second year\nin a row, we received a score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2022 Corporate Equality Index.\nCreating an inclusive and diverse culture that supports and values team members is important to attracting and retaining\ntalented, dedicated employees. We’re implementing initiatives to diversify our workforce and leadership pipeline, embed\npolicies and practices that ensure fairness and instill and reward behaviors across the organization that foster belonging\nand increase employee engagement. Out of the 19 members of our Senior Leadership Team and Board of Directors, nine\nare female, three are Black, and one is Hispanic. We have also initiated multiple corporate initiatives over the past several\nyears, including required unconscious bias training for team members, annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion training for\nall team members, the launch of The Papa John’s Foundation for Building Community, our Day of Service with Boys and\nGirls Clubs of America, and the creation of eight employee resource affinity groups.\nTalent Attraction, Retention and Development\nOur ability to attract and retain hourly employees in our restaurants has become more challenging, especially as the job\nmarket has become more competitive and COVID-19 related factors, especially the rapid spread of the Omicron variant,\nhave prevented employees from being able to work due to illness or quarantine. While we expect the impact of Omicron\nto subside, we expect labor and inflationary cost challenges to be a continued priority focus for us in 2022. We continue\nto aspire to be the employer of choice in our industry, including through commitment to diversity and inclusion, and our\ninvestments in our team members. In 2021, we announced new hiring, referral and appreciation bonuses. We also made\npermanent the expanded health, wellness, paid time off and college tuition benefits that we rolled out during the pandemic,\nincluding free virtual healthcare visits for all part-time and full-time team members. We intend to continue making these\nkinds of investments to ensure we support our team members as they support our customers.\nTo help our team members succeed in their roles and to ensure consistent operational execution, we emphasize continuous\ntraining and development opportunities, including providing innovative tools and materials for the operational training\nand development of team members. Operations personnel complete our management training program and ongoing\ndevelopment programs, including multi-unit training, in which instruction is given on all aspects of our systems and\noperations. In addition, to further support our team members’ development, we have established our Dough & Degrees\nprogram, which allows our team members to earn a college degree for free or at a reduced tuition in partnership with\nPurdue University Global and the University of Maryland Global Campus. We also offer a tuition reimbursement program\nthat provides another opportunity for our team members to advance their careers.\nWorkplace Health and Safety\nAs part of the Company’s enterprise-wide safety management system, we invest in training, technology and people to\nprotect both our customers and team members. All Papa John’s team members, from those at our corporate offices to\n7\nthose working in our warehouses and restaurants, receive annual safety training based on the requirements of their\nroles. Our QC Centers and restaurant operations undergo annual safety audits, as well as random safety checks by regional\nsafety managers and field safety coordinators.\nWe have also taken steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our team members and our customers by\nimplementing extra health and safety measures across our business, including No Contact Delivery and enhanced cleaning\nand sanitization measures.\nIndustry and Competition\nThe United States Quick Service Restaurant pizza (“QSR Pizza”) industry is mature and highly competitive with respect\nto price, service, location, food quality, customer loyalty programs and product innovation. The QSR Pizza category is\nlargely fragmented, and competitors include a few large national chains and many smaller regional chains, as well as a\nlarge number of local independent pizza operators, any of which can utilize a growing number of food delivery services.\nSome of our competitors have been in existence for substantially longer periods than Papa John’s, have substantially\ngreater resources than Papa John’s and can have higher levels of restaurant penetration and stronger, more developed brand\nawareness in markets where we compete. Competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery concepts also\ncontinues to increase.\nInternationally, the pizza delivery model is not as mature as the domestic market and presents a growth opportunity for\nPapa John’s. We believe demand from international consumers will continue to increase as the demand for pizza delivery\nand carryout continues. We continue to execute on our growth strategy and expand throughout the world.\nWith respect to the sale of franchises, we compete with many franchisors of restaurants and other business concepts. There\nis also active competition for management personnel, drivers and hourly team members, and attractive commercial real\nestate sites suitable for Papa John’s restaurants.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe, along with our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting the operation of\nour respective businesses, including laws and regulations related to our marketing and advertising as well as the preparation\nand sale of food, food safety and menu labeling. Each Papa John’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a\nnumber of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the state\nor municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, required licenses or\napprovals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant in a particular area. Our QC Centers are licensed and\nsubject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and the operation of our trucks is subject to federal and state\ntransportation regulations. We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations. In addition, our domestic\noperations are subject to various federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, benefits,\ntaxation, working conditions, citizenship requirements, and overtime.\nWe are subject to Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of\nfranchises. The laws of several states also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC\nrequires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information. State\nlaws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a significant number of states, and bills have\nbeen introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the U.S. franchisor-franchisee\nrelationship in certain respects if such bills were enacted. State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope\nof non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign\ncountries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee\nrelationship. National, state and local government regulations or initiatives, including health care legislation, “living\nwage,” or other current or proposed regulations, and increases in minimum wage rates affect Papa John’s as well as others\nwithin the restaurant industry. We are also subject to applicable laws in each non-U.S. jurisdiction in which we operate.\n8\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nWe are subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally. The legal and regulatory landscape for privacy\nand data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increase in attention given to privacy and data protection\nissues with the potential to impact our business. This includes recently enacted laws and regulations in the U.S. and in\nother countries which require notification to individuals and government authorities of breaches involving certain\ncategories of personal information. Any changes in privacy and data protection laws or regulations could also adversely\nimpact the way we use e-mail, text messages and other marketing techniques and could require changes in our marketing\nstrategies. We have a privacy policy posted on our website at www.papajohns.com. The security of our financial data,\ncustomer information and other personal information is a priority for us.\nTrademarks, Copyrights and Domain Names\nWe protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, foreign\nintellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. We have also registered, and\napplied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. From time\nto time, we are made aware of the use by other persons in certain geographical areas of names and marks that are the same\nas or substantially similar to our marks. It is our policy to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to\nvigorously oppose any infringement of our marks.\nWe hold copyrights in authored works used in our business, including advertisements, packaging, training, website, and\npromotional materials. In addition, we have registered and maintain Internet domain names, including “papajohns.com,”\nand country code domains patterned as papajohns.cc, or a close variation thereof, with “.cc” representing a specific country\ncode.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are not aware of any federal, state, local or international environmental laws or regulations that we expect to materially\naffect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict the effect\nof possible future environment legislation or regulations on our operations. During 2021, we had no material environmental\ncompliance-related capital expenditures, and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2022.\nImpact of COVID-19\nPlease refer to “Recent Business Matters” within “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” for a discussion of recent business developments, including the impact the COVID-19\npandemic is having on our business and results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditional Information\nAll of our periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) pursuant to\nSection 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are available, free\nof charge, through our website located at www.papajohns.com.

Risk Factors\nWe are subject to risks that could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThese risks could cause actual operating results to differ from those expressed in certain “forward-looking statements”\ncontained in this Form 10-K as well as in other Company communications. You should carefully consider the following\nrisk factors together with all other information included in this Form 10-K and our other publicly filed documents.\nIndustry Risks\nWe are subject to risks related to epidemic and pandemic outbreaks, including COVID-19, which may have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has had, and is expected to continue to have,\nsignificant adverse impacts on economic and market conditions. In response to the pandemic, governments and other\nauthorities around the world have imposed or re-imposed measures to attempt to control the spread of COVID-19,\nincluding restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans, social distancing requirements,\nincluding limitations on gatherings, shelter-in-place orders and quarantines, facial covering mandates and mandated\nbusiness closures, which have resulted in significant changes in commercial activity and consumer behavior. We cannot\npredict when the effects of the pandemic will subside, how long there will be continuing resurgences of the virus or its\nvariants, including the Delta and Omicron variants, or the effectiveness and uptake of vaccines and treatment therapies.\nTo the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues or worsens, restrictions imposed by governments may not be lifted,\nor additional restrictions may be imposed. As a result, businesses such as our restaurants or QC Centers are subject to\nrestrictions or other requirements intended to control the spread of COVID-19, including vaccine or testing mandates, and\nour employees may be prohibited from working, and our supply chains may be interrupted. It may be challenging to staff\nour QC Centers and restaurants and to obtain and process ingredients and raw materials to support our business needs. In\naddition, individuals have and may continue to become ill, quarantined or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to\nhealth reasons, vaccine mandates or other governmental restrictions. Also, governments may impose other laws,\nregulations or taxes that could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe potential adverse effects of COVID-19 also could include, but may not be limited to, our ability to meet consumer\ndemand through the continued availability of our workforce and our franchisees’ workforce; adverse impacts from new\nlaws and regulations affecting our business; increased cyber risks and reliance on technology infrastructure to support our\nbusiness and operations, including through remote-work protocols; fluctuations in foreign currency markets; credit risks\nof our customers and counterparties; and impairment of long-lived assets, the carrying value of goodwill or other\nindefinite-lived intangible assets. However, given the evolving health, economic, social, and governmental environments,\nthe specific impact that COVID-19 could have on these risks remains uncertain.\nMoreover, during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant increase in comparable sales\nand revenues. While we believe that as pandemic-related restrictions are lifted, we are benefitting from the increase in\ncustomers we have experienced due to our menu innovation, customer loyalty programs and our offerings of high-quality\npizza and other menu items, we do not expect to be able to maintain the same level of annual growth rates in comparable\nsales and revenues in the future.\nOur profitability may suffer as a result of intense competition in our industry.\nThe U.S. QSR Pizza industry is mature and highly competitive. Competition is based on price, service, location, food\nquality, brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, use of\ntechnology, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. We may need to reduce the prices for some of\nour products to respond to competitive and customer pressures, which may adversely affect our profitability. When\ncommodity and other costs increase, we may be limited in our ability to increase prices. With the significant level of\ncompetition and the pace of innovation, we may be required to increase investment spending in several areas, particularly\nmarketing and technology, which can decrease profitability.\n10\nIn addition to competition with our larger competitors, we face competition from new competitors such as fast casual pizza\nconcepts. We also face competitive pressures from an array of food delivery concepts and aggregators delivering for quick\nservice or dine in restaurants, using new delivery technologies or delivering for competitors who previously did not have\ndelivery capabilities, some of which may have more effective marketing. The emergence or growth of new competitors,\nin the pizza category or in the food service industry generally, may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our\nmarket share and could negatively impact our sales and our system-wide restaurant operations. We also face increasing\ncompetition from other home delivery services and grocery stores that offer an increasing variety of prepped or prepared\nmeals in response to consumer demand. As a result, our sales can be directly and negatively impacted by actions of our\ncompetitors, the emergence or growth of new competitors, consumer sentiment or other factors outside our control.\nOne of our competitive strengths is our “BETTER INGREDIENTS. BETTER PIZZA.®” brand promise. This means we\nmay use ingredients that cost more than the ingredients some of our competitors may use. Because of our investment in\nhigher-quality ingredients, we could have lower profit margins than some of our competitors if we are not able to establish\na quality differentiator that resonates with consumers. Our sales may be particularly impacted as competitors increasingly\nemphasize lower-cost menu options.\nChanges in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could adversely impact our results.\nChanges in consumer preferences and trends could negatively affect us (for example, changes in consumer perceptions of\ncertain ingredients that could cause consumers to avoid pizza or some of its ingredients in favor of foods that are or are\nperceived as healthier, lower-calorie, or lower in carbohydrates or otherwise based on their ingredients or nutritional\ncontent). Preferences for a dining experience such as fast casual pizza concepts could also adversely affect our restaurant\nbusiness and reduce the effectiveness of our marketing and technology initiatives. Also, our success depends to a\nsignificant extent on numerous factors affecting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer income and spending,\nsuch as general economic conditions, customer sentiment and the level of employment. Any factors that could cause\nconsumers to spend less on food or shift to lower-priced products could reduce sales or inhibit our ability to maintain or\nincrease pricing, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nFood safety and quality concerns may negatively impact our business and profitability.\nIncidents or reports of food- or water-borne illness or other food safety issues, investigations or other actions by food\nsafety regulators, food contamination or tampering, employee hygiene and cleanliness failures, improper franchisee or\nemployee conduct, or presence of communicable disease at our restaurants (both Company-owned and franchised), QC\nCenters, or suppliers could lead to product liability or other claims. If we were to experience any such incidents or reports,\nour brand and reputation could be negatively impacted. This could result in a significant decrease in customer traffic and\ncould negatively impact our revenues and profits. Similar incidents or reports occurring at quick service restaurants\nunrelated to us could likewise create negative publicity, which could negatively impact consumer behavior towards us.\nWe rely on our domestic and international suppliers, as do our franchisees, to provide quality ingredients and to comply\nwith applicable laws and industry standards. A failure of one of our domestic or international suppliers to meet our quality\nstandards, or meet domestic or international food industry standards, could result in a disruption in our supply chain and\nnegatively impact our brand and our results.\nFailure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur results depend upon our ability to differentiate our brand and our reputation for quality. Damage to our brand or\nreputation could negatively impact our business and financial results. Our brand has been highly rated in certain U.S.\nsurveys, and we strive to build the value of our brand as we develop international markets.\nConsumer perceptions of our brand are affected by a variety of factors, such as the nutritional content and preparation of\nour food, the quality of the ingredients we use, our corporate culture, our policies and systems related to diversity, equity\n11\nand inclusion, our business practices, our engagement in local communities and the manner in which we source the\ncommodities we use.\nConsumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly.\nConsumer perceptions may also be affected by third parties, including former employees and executives, presenting or\npromoting adverse commentary or portrayals of our industry, our brand, our suppliers or our franchisees, or otherwise\nmaking statements, disclosing information or taking actions that could damage our reputation. If we are unsuccessful in\nmanaging incidents that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity\nor result in litigation, our brand value and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could\nadversely impact our business.\nIn recent years, there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, chat platforms,\nsocial media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience\nof consumers and other persons. The rising popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has\nincreased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. The dissemination of negative information via social\nmedia could harm our business, brand, reputation, marketing partners, financial condition, and results of operations,\nregardless of the information’s accuracy.\nIn addition, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers and the public in general. Failure to use social\nmedia effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue. Other risks associated with the use of social media\ninclude improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our brand, exposure of personally\nidentifiable information, fraud, hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information.\nOur franchise business model presents a number of risks.\nOur success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence\nover their operations. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-\nto-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the\nability of our franchisees to maintain or grow their sales. If our franchisees do not maintain or grow sales, our revenues\nand margins could be negatively affected. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, especially in emerging markets\nand/or high-cost markets, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, required\nfinancial support from us, higher numbers of restaurant closures, reduced numbers of restaurant openings, delayed or\nreduced payments to us, or increased franchisee assistance, which reduces our revenues.\nOur success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our franchisees to remain aligned with us on\noperating, promotional and marketing plans. Franchisees’ ability to continue to grow is also dependent in large part on the\navailability of franchisee funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in\ngeneral or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees. Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our\nfranchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and\nvalues, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation.\nIf franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, the brand’s image\nand reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\nWe may be adversely impacted by increases in the cost of food ingredients and other costs.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in prices of commodities. An increase in the cost or sustained high levels of the cost of\ncheese or other commodities could adversely affect the profitability of our system-wide restaurant operations, particularly\nif we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to offset increased costs. We have recently experienced\ninflation in commodities prices, including food ingredients, which has increased our operating expenses. Cheese,\nrepresenting our largest food cost, and other commodities can be subject to significant cost fluctuations due to weather,\navailability, global demand and other factors that are beyond our control. Additionally, increases in labor, mileage,\ninsurance, fuel, and other costs could adversely affect the profitability of our restaurant and QC Center businesses. Many\n12\nof the factors affecting costs in our system-wide restaurant operations are beyond our control, and we may not be able to\nadequately mitigate these costs or pass along these costs to our customers or franchisees, given the significant competitive\npricing pressures we face.\nChanges in privacy or data protection laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email, text messages and postal mailings. Any future\nrestrictions in federal, state or foreign laws regarding marketing and solicitation or domestic or international data protection\nlaws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email, text messages and postal\nmailing techniques and could force changes in our marketing strategies. If this occurs, we may need to develop alternative\nmarketing strategies, which may not be as effective and could impact the amount and timing of our revenues.\nOur international operations are subject to increased risks and other factors that may make it more difficult to achieve or\nmaintain profitability or meet planned growth rates.\nOur international operations could be negatively impacted by volatility and instability in international economic, political,\nsecurity or health conditions in the countries in which the Company or our franchisees operate, especially in emerging\nmarkets. In addition, there are risks associated with differing business and social cultures and consumer preferences. We\nmay face limited availability for restaurant locations, higher location costs and difficulties in franchisee selection and\nfinancing. We may be subject to difficulties in sourcing and importing high-quality ingredients (and ensuring food safety)\nin a cost-effective manner, hiring and retaining qualified team members, marketing effectively and adequately investing\nin information technology, especially in emerging markets.\nOur international operations are also subject to additional risk factors, including import and export controls, compliance\nwith anti-corruption and other foreign laws, difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contract rights in foreign\njurisdictions, and the imposition of increased or new tariffs or trade barriers. We intend to continue to expand\ninternationally, which would make the risks related to our international operations more significant over time.\nOur international restaurants’ results, which are completely franchised, depend heavily on the operating capabilities and\nfinancial strength of our franchisees. Any changes in the ability of our franchisees to run their stores profitably in\naccordance with our operating standards, or to effectively sub-franchise restaurants, could result in brand damage, a higher\nnumber of restaurant closures and a reduction in the number of new restaurant openings.\nSales made by our franchisees in international markets and certain loans we provide to such franchisees are denominated\nin their local currencies, and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar occur relative to the local currencies. Accordingly, changes in\ncurrency exchange rates will cause our revenues, investment income and operating results to fluctuate. We have not\nhistorically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Our international revenues and earnings may be\nadversely impacted as the U.S. dollar rises against foreign currencies because the local currency will translate into fewer\nU.S. dollars. Additionally, the value of certain assets or loans denominated in local currencies may deteriorate. Other\nitems denominated in U.S. dollars, including product imports or loans, may also become more expensive, putting pressure\non franchisees’ cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union\n(referred to as “Brexit”), including implications for the free flow of labor and goods in the United Kingdom and the\nEuropean Union and other financial, legal, tax and trade implications.\nAdverse global economic conditions subject us to additional risk.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which\nneither we nor our franchisees have control. An economic downturn, including deterioration in the economic conditions\nin the U.S. or international markets where we compete, may result in a reduction in the demand for our products, longer\npayment cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.\nPoor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could\nalso disrupt our business and adversely affect our results. Higher inflation, and a related increase in costs, including rising\n13\ninterest rates, could also impact our franchisees and their ability to open new restaurants or operating existing restaurants\nprofitability.\nHigher labor costs, increased competition for qualified team members and ensuring adequate staffing in our restaurants\nand QC Centers increase the cost of doing business. Additionally, changes in employment and labor laws, including health\ncare legislation and minimum wage increases, could increase costs for our system-wide operations.\nOur success depends in part on our and our franchisees’ ability to recruit, motivate, train and retain a qualified workforce\nto work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. Our ability to attract and retain hourly employees in\nour restaurants has recently become more challenging, especially as the job market has become more competitive, and we\nexpect staffing and labor challenges to continue into 2022. Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and\nretaining qualified employees to work in Company-owned and franchised restaurants, which have stemmed in part from\nthe labor shortage experienced by the QSR industry in 2021, have had, and may in the future have, a negative impact on\nour Company-owned restaurant margins and the margins of franchised restaurants. Competition for qualified drivers for\nboth our restaurants and supply-chain function also continues to increase as more companies compete for drivers or enter\nthe delivery space, including third party aggregators. Additionally, economic actions, such as boycotts, protests, work\nstoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent)\nor our franchisees and suppliers. Social media may be used to foster negative perceptions of employment with our\nCompany in particular or in our industry generally, and to promote strikes or boycotts.\nWe are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime\ncompensation, benefits, working conditions, citizenship requirements and discrimination and family and medical leave\nand employee related litigation. Labor costs and labor-related benefits are primary components in the cost of operation of\nour restaurants and QC Centers. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could increase\nour system-wide labor costs.\nA significant number of hourly personnel are paid at rates close to the federal and state minimum wage requirements.\nAccordingly, the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases above federal wage rates or regulations\nrelated to exempt employees has increased and could continue to increase labor costs for our domestic system-wide\noperations. A significant increase in the federal minimum wage requirement could adversely impact our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to invest\nin or adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including digital ordering solutions, through which over half of our domestic\nsales originate. We also rely heavily on point-of-sale processing in our Company-owned and franchised restaurants for\ndata collection and payment systems for the collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions, and other processes and\nprocedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends on the reliability and capacity of these\ntechnology systems. In addition, we anticipate that consumers will continue to have more options to place orders digitally,\nboth domestically and internationally. We plan to continue to invest in enhancing and improving the functionality and\nfeatures of our information technology systems. However, we cannot ensure that our initiatives will be beneficial to the\nextent, or within the timeframes, expected or that the estimated improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. Our\nfailure to adequately invest in new technology and adapt to technological developments and industry trends, particularly\nour digital ordering capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share. Notwithstanding adequate\ninvestment in new technology, our marketing and technology initiatives may not be successful in improving our\ncomparable sales results. Additionally, we are in an environment where the technology life cycle is short and consumer\ntechnology demands are high, which requires continued reinvestment in technology that will increase the cost of doing\nbusiness and will increase the risk that our technology may not be customer-centric or could become obsolete, inefficient\nor otherwise incompatible with other systems.\nWe rely on our international franchisees to maintain their own point-of-sale and online ordering systems, which are often\npurchased from third-party vendors, potentially exposing international franchisees to more operational risk, including\ncyber and data privacy risks and governmental regulation compliance risks.\n14\nCompany Risks\nOur reorganization activities may increase our expenses, may not be successful, and may adversely impact employee\nhiring and retention.\nOn September 17, 2020, we announced plans to open an office in Atlanta, Georgia, which opened in October 2021. As a\nresult, we have incurred and may continue to incur certain non-recurring corporate reorganization costs, and these expenses\nhave impacted and could adversely impact our results of operations during the relevant periods and reduce our cash\nposition. Additionally, our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our corporate reorganization are subject to\nassumptions and uncertainties. If we do not realize the anticipated benefits from these measures, or if we incur costs\ngreater than anticipated, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, turnover in our corporate office support teams due to certain functions relocating to our office in Georgia could\ndistract our employees, decrease employee morale, harm our reputation, and negatively impact the overall performance of\nour corporate support teams. As a result of these or other similar risks, our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to effectively market our products or maintain key marketing partnerships.\nThe success of our business depends on the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional plans. We may not be able to\neffectively execute our national or local marketing plans, particularly if we experienced lower sales that would result in\nreduced levels of marketing funds. We may be required to expend additional funds to effectively improve consumer\nsentiment and sales, and we may also be required to engage in additional activities to retain customers or attract new\ncustomers to the brand. Such marketing expenses and promotional activities, which could include discounting our\nproducts, could adversely impact our results.\nPersons or marketing partners who endorse our products could take actions that harm their reputations, which could also\ncause harm to our brand. From time to time, in response to changes in the business environment and the audience share of\nmarketing channels, we expect to reallocate marketing resources across social media and other channels. That reallocation\nmay not be effective or as successful as the marketing and advertising allocations of our competitors, which could\nnegatively impact the amount and timing of our revenues.\nWe may not be able to execute our strategy or achieve our planned growth targets, which could negatively impact our\nbusiness and our financial results.\nOur growth strategy depends on our and our franchisees’ ability to open new restaurants and to operate them on a profitable\nbasis. We expect substantially all of our international unit growth and much of our domestic unit growth to be franchised\nunits. Accordingly, our profitability increasingly depends upon royalty revenues from franchisees. If our franchisees are\nnot able to operate their businesses successfully under our franchised business model, our results could suffer.\nAdditionally, we may fail to attract new qualified franchisees or existing franchisees may close underperforming locations.\nPlanned growth targets and the ability to operate new and existing restaurants profitably are affected by economic,\nregulatory and competitive conditions and consumer buying habits. A decrease in sales, or increased commodity or\noperating costs, including, but not limited to, employee compensation and benefits or insurance costs, could slow the rate\nof new store openings or increase the number of store closings. Our business is susceptible to adverse changes in local,\nnational and global economic conditions, which could make it difficult for us to meet our growth targets. Additionally, we\nor our franchisees may face challenges securing financing, finding suitable store locations at acceptable terms or securing\nrequired domestic or foreign government permits and approvals. Declines in comparable sales, net store openings and\nrelated operating profits can impact our stock price. If we do not continue to grow future sales and operating results and\nmeet our related growth targets or external expectations for net restaurant openings or our other strategic objectives in the\nfuture, our stock price could decline.\n15\nOur franchisees remain dependent on the availability of financing to remodel or renovate existing locations, upgrade\nsystems and enhance technology, or construct and open new restaurants. From time to time, the Company may provide\nfinancing to certain franchisees and prospective franchisees in order to mitigate store closings, allow new units to open, or\ncomplete required upgrades. If we are unable or unwilling to provide such financing, which is a function of, among other\nthings, a franchisee’s creditworthiness, the number of new restaurant openings may be slower or the rate of closures may\nbe higher than expected and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. To the extent we provide financing to\nfranchisees, our results could be negatively impacted by negative performance of these franchisee loans.\nOur dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers for some ingredients could result in disruptions to our\nbusiness.\nDomestic restaurants purchase substantially all food and related products from our QC Centers. We are dependent on\nLeprino Foods Dairy Products Company (“Leprino”) as our sole supplier for mozzarella cheese, one of our key ingredients.\nLeprino, one of the major pizza category suppliers of cheese in the United States, currently supplies all of our mozzarella\ncheese domestically and substantially all of our mozzarella cheese internationally. We also depend on a sole source for\nour supply of certain desserts and garlic sauce, which constitute less than 10% of our domestic Company-owned restaurant\nsales. While we have no other sole sources of supply for key ingredients or menu items, we do source other key ingredients\nfrom a limited number of suppliers. Alternative sources of mozzarella cheese, desserts, other key ingredients or menu\nitems may not be available on a timely basis or may not be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current\narrangements.\nIncrease in ingredient and other operating costs, including those caused by weather, climate change, COVID-19 and food\nsafety, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Company-owned and franchised restaurants could also be harmed by supply chain interruptions including those caused\nby factors beyond our control or the control of our suppliers. We experienced limited interruptions in our supply chain in\n2021. However, prolonged disruption in the supply of products from or to our QC Centers due to weather, climate change,\nnatural disasters, COVID-19, crop disease, food safety incidents, regulatory compliance, labor dispute or interruption of\nservice by carriers could increase costs, limit the availability of ingredients critical to our restaurant operations and have a\nsignificant impact on results. Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in global weather patterns, including\nrelated to global climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients. In\nparticular, adverse weather or crop disease affecting the California tomato crop could disrupt the supply of pizza sauce to\nour and our franchisees’ restaurants. Insolvency of key suppliers could also cause similar business interruptions and\nnegatively impact our business.\nWe rely on third parties for certain business processes and services, and failure or inability of such third-party vendors to\nperform subjects us to risks, including business disruption and increased costs.\nWe depend on the performance of suppliers, aggregators and other third parties in our business operations. Third-party\nbusiness processes we utilize include information technology, gift card authorization and processing, other payment\nprocessing, benefits, and other accounting and business services. We conduct third-party due diligence and seek to obtain\ncontractual assurance that our vendors will maintain adequate controls, such as adequate security against data\nbreaches. However, the failure of our suppliers to maintain adequate controls or comply with our expectations and\nstandards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nChanges in purchasing practices by our domestic franchisees could harm our commissary business.\nAlthough our domestic franchisees currently purchase substantially all food products from our QC Centers, the only\nrequired QC Center purchases by franchisees are pizza sauce, dough and other items we may designate as proprietary or\nintegral to our system. Any changes in purchasing practices by domestic franchisees, such as seeking alternative approved\nsuppliers of ingredients or other food products, could adversely affect the financial results of our QC Centers and the\nCompany.\n16\nOur current insurance may not be adequate and we may experience claims in excess of our reserves.\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability, property, and\nhealth insurance coverage provided to our employees are funded by the Company up to certain retention levels under our\nretention programs. Retention limits generally range up to $1.0 million. These insurance programs may not be adequate to\nprotect us, and it may be difficult or impossible to obtain additional coverage or maintain current coverage at a reasonable\ncost. We also have experienced claims volatility and high costs for our insurance programs. We estimate loss reserves\nbased on historical trends, actuarial assumptions and other data available to us, but we may not be able to accurately\nestimate reserves. If we experience claims in excess of our projections, our business could be negatively impacted. Our\nfranchisees could be similarly impacted by higher claims experience, hurting both their operating results and/or limiting\ntheir ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have incurred substantial debt obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition, and we may be able\nto incur substantially more indebtedness, including secured debt, and take other actions that could further exacerbate the\nrisks associated with our substantial indebtedness or affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nOur outstanding debt as of December 26, 2021 was $490.0 million, which was comprised of $400.0 million outstanding\nunder our 3.875% senior notes due 2029 (the “Notes”) and $90.0 million under our revolving credit facility (the “PJI\nRevolving Facility”) that forms part of our amended and restated credit agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”).\nWe had approximately $510.0 million of remaining availability under the PJI Revolving Facility as of December 26, 2021.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness,\nthereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, growth\nopportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n increase our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the\nindustry in which we operate, regulatory and economic conditions;\n expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement will be\nsubject to variable rates of interest;\n increase our vulnerability to a downgrade of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds,\nliquidity and access to capital markets;\n place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n limit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nWe expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from\noperations. Our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal of and interest on our indebtedness when due thus depends\non our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We will not be able\nto control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from\ncompetitors.\nIn addition, subject to restrictions in the agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness, we may be able to\nincur substantially more indebtedness in the future, resulting in higher leverage. The Indenture and the Amended Credit\nAgreement allow us to incur additional indebtedness, including secured debt. Such additional indebtedness may be\nsubstantial. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not prohibited by\nthe Indenture or the Amended Credit Agreement could have the effect of exacerbating the risks associated with our\nsubstantial indebtedness or diminishing our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due, which would reduce\nthe availability of cash flow to fund acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, other growth opportunities and\nother general corporate purposes.\n17\nThe agreements governing our debt, including the Indenture governing our Notes and the Amended Credit Agreement,\ncontain various covenants that impose restrictions on us.\nThe Indenture and the Amended Credit Agreement impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. In\nparticular, such agreements limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n incur additional indebtedness;\n make certain investments;\n sell assets, including capital stock of certain subsidiaries;\n declare or pay dividends, repurchase or redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;\n consolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve;\n enter into transactions with our affiliates; and\n incur liens.\nIn addition, our Amended Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with specified leverage ratios under certain\ncircumstances. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control, and these\nprovisions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise conduct our\nbusiness activities and plans.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting\nour ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities.\nFurthermore, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these\ncovenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a\ndefault under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. Such\na default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any\ncollateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy\nall of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt\nand to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we\nwill be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these\nagreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe are exposed to variable interest rates under our Amended Credit Agreement, and increases in interest rates would also\nincrease our debt service costs and could materially impact our profitability.\nWe are exposed to variable interest rates under the Amended Credit Agreement. We have entered into interest rate swaps\nthat fix a significant portion of our variable interest rate risk. However, by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures\nto changes in interest rates, we also expose ourselves to credit risk. Credit risk is due to the possible failure of the\ncounterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.\nGeneral Risks\nNatural disasters, hostilities, social unrest, severe weather and other catastrophic events may disrupt our operations or\nsupply chain.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster, hostilities, cyber-attack, social unrest, terrorist activity, outbreak of epidemic,\npandemic or other contagious disease, power outages, severe weather (such as tornados, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms,\nfloods, heat waves, etc.) or other catastrophic events may disrupt our operations or supply chain and result in the closure\nof our restaurants (Company-owned or franchised), our corporate offices, any of our QC Centers or the facilities of our\nsuppliers, and can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence levels and supply availability and costs, any\nof which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\n18\nIncreasingly complex laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in an increasingly complex regulatory environment, and the cost of regulatory compliance is increasing. Our\nfailure, or the failure of any of our franchisees, to comply with applicable U.S. and international labor, health care, food,\nhealth and safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery and corruption, competition, environmental and other laws may result\nin civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties. Enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal\nrequirements, and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs\nand create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or\noperating results. Increased regulatory scrutiny of food matters and product marketing claims, and increased litigation and\nenforcement actions may increase compliance and legal costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition or operating results. Governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact\nour business. For example, some local government agencies have implemented ordinances that restrict the sale of certain\nfood or drink products.\nCompliance with new or additional domestic and international government laws or regulations, including the European\nUnion General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) which could\nincrease costs for compliance. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently\nand increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk\nand costs. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to reputational damage and significant\nlitigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in various jurisdictions. For example, a failure to\ncomply with the GDPR could result in fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues.\nThere also has been increased stakeholder focus, including by U.S. and foreign governmental authorities, investors, media\nand nongovernmental organizations, on environmental sustainability matters, such as climate change, the reduction of\ngreenhouse gases and water consumption. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other\nenvironmental concerns could result in future increases in taxes, restrictions on or increases in the costs of supplies,\ntransportation and utilities, any of which could increase our operating costs and those of our franchisees, and necessitate\nfuture investments in facilities and equipment. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set\ntargets, or establish additional goals to take actions to meet them, which could expose us and our franchisees to market,\noperational, execution and reputational costs or risks. Conversely, if we are not effective in addressing social and\nenvironmental sustainability matters, consumer trust and investor confidence in our Company may suffer.\nDisruptions of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to compete and conduct our\nbusiness.\nOur critical business and information technology systems have in the past and could in the future be damaged or interrupted\nby power loss, various technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks, ransomware sabotage or acts of God. In particular,\nthe Company and our franchisees have experienced occasional interruptions of our digital ordering solutions, which make\nonline ordering unavailable or slow to respond, negatively impacting sales and the experience of our customers. If our\ndigital ordering solutions do not perform with adequate speed and security, our customers may be less inclined to return\nto our digital ordering solutions.\nPart of our technology infrastructure, such as our domestic point-of-sale system, is specifically designed for us and our\noperational systems, which could cause unexpected costs, delays or inefficiencies when infrastructure upgrades are needed\nor prolonged and widespread technological difficulties occur. Significant portions of our technology infrastructure,\nparticularly in our digital ordering solutions, are provided by third parties, and the performance of these systems is largely\nbeyond our control. Occasionally, we have experienced or could experience temporary disruptions in our business due to\nthird-party systems failing to adequately perform. Failure to manage future failures of these systems, particularly as our\nonline sales grow, could harm our business and the satisfaction of our customers. Such third-party systems could be\ndisrupted either through system failure or if third party vendor patents and contractual agreements do not afford us\nprotection against similar technology. In addition, we may not have or be able to obtain adequate protection or insurance\nto mitigate the risks of these events or compensate for losses related to these events, which could damage our business and\nreputation and be expensive and difficult to remedy or repair.\n19\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in damage to our reputation, loss of sales, and/or\nsubject us to litigation, penalties or significant costs.\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations. We collect and retain large volumes of\ninternal and customer data, including credit card data and other personally identifiable information of our employees and\ncustomers housed in the various information systems we use. Constantly changing information security threats, particularly\npersistent cyber security threats, pose risks to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability\nand integrity of our data and the availability and integrity of our critical business functions. As techniques used in cyber-\nattacks evolve, we may not be able to timely detect threats or anticipate and implement adequate security measures. The\nintegrity and protection of the customer, employee, franchisee and Company data are critical to us. Our information\ntechnology systems and databases, and those provided by our third-party vendors, including international vendors, have\nbeen and will continue to be subject to computer viruses, malware attacks, unauthorized user attempts, phishing and denial\nof service and other malicious cyber-attacks. The failure to prevent fraud or security breaches or to adequately invest in\ndata security could harm our business and revenues due to the reputational damage to our brand. Such a breach could also\nresult in litigation, regulatory actions, penalties, and other significant costs to us and have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial results. These costs could be significant and well in excess of, or not covered by, our cyber insurance coverage.\nWe have been and will continue to be subject to various types of investigations and litigation, including collective and\nclass action litigation, which could subject us to significant damages or other remedies.\nWe are subject to the risk of investigations and litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, franchisees,\nstate and federal agencies, stockholders and employees. From time to time, we are involved in a number of lawsuits,\nclaims, investigations, and proceedings consisting of securities, antitrust, intellectual property, employment, consumer,\npersonal injury, corporate governance, commercial and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.\nWe have been subject to claims in cases containing collective and class action allegations. Plaintiffs in these types of\nlawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense\ncosts relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. Litigation trends involving personal injury, employment\nlaw, intellectual property and the relationship between franchisors and franchisees may increase our cost of doing business.\nWe evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we\nestimate the amount of potential losses to us. In many cases, particularly collective and class action cases, we may not be\nable to estimate the amount of potential losses and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient. These assessments are\nmade by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of\njudgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or\nwhether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our\noperations and negatively impact earnings. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from\nthese types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.\nWe may be subject to harassment or discrimination claims and legal proceedings. Our Code of Ethics and Business\nConduct policies prohibit harassment and discrimination in the workplace, in sexual or in any other form. To monitor and\nenforce these policies, we have ongoing programs for workplace training and compliance, and we investigate and take\ndisciplinary action with respect to alleged violations. Nevertheless, actions by our team members could violate those\npolicies. Franchisees and suppliers are also required to comply with all applicable laws and govern themselves with\nintegrity. Any violations (or perceptions thereof) by our franchisees or suppliers could have a negative impact on consumer\nperceptions of us and our business and create reputational or other harm to the Company.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could negatively affect our results of\noperations.\nWe depend on the Papa John’s brand name and rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and similar\nintellectual property rights to protect and promote our brand. We believe the success of our business depends on our\ncontinued ability to exclusively use our existing marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand, both\ndomestically and abroad. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and we may be required\n20\nto pursue litigation to prevent consumer confusion and preserve our brand’s high-quality reputation. Litigation could result\nin high costs and diversion of resources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, regardless of the outcome.\nWe may be subject to impairment charges.\nImpairment charges are possible due to the nature and timing of decisions we make about underperforming assets or\nmarkets, or if previously opened or acquired restaurants perform below our expectations. This could result in a decrease\nin our reported asset value and reduction in our net income.\nWe operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results.\nWe operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. We have international operations and\ngenerate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions. The domestic and international tax environments continue\nto evolve as a result of tax changes in various jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the tax laws in certain\ncountries, including the United States, could impact our future operating results. A significant increase in the U.S.\ncorporate tax rate could negatively impact our financial results.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n21\nItem 2.

The initial term of most domestic restaurant\nleases is five years with most leases providing for one or more options to renew for at least one additional term. Generally,\nthe leases are triple net leases, which require us to pay all or a portion of the cost of insurance, taxes and utilities. As a\nresult of assigning our interest in obligations under property leases as a condition of the refranchising of certain restaurants,\nwe are also contingently liable for payment of approximately 70 domestic leases.\nOur corporate office in Atlanta, Georgia, is located in a leased space. Nine of our 12 North America QC Centers are located\nin leased spaces, with the remaining three QC centers located in buildings we own. Our corporate office and our printing\noperations located in Louisville, KY are in buildings owned by us. We also maintain a Company-owned office and a full-\nservice QC Center outside of London, United Kingdom (“UK”), where our international operations are managed.\nAt December 26, 2021, we leased and subleased approximately 425 Papa John’s restaurant sites to franchisees in the UK.\nThe initial lease terms on the franchised sites in the UK are generally 15 years. The initial lease terms of the franchisee\nsubleases are generally five to ten years. See “Note 3” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional\ninformation.\nItem 3.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nOur common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol\n“PZZA”. As of February 17, 2022, there were 1,359 record holders of our common stock. However, there are significantly\nmore beneficial owners of our common stock than there are record holders.\nOn January 27, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock,\nrepresenting an approximate $12.7 million aggregate dividend that was paid on February 18, 2022 to common stockholders\nof record as of the close of business on February 7, 2022.\nWe anticipate continuing the payment of quarterly cash dividends. The actual amount of such dividends is subject to\ndeclaration by our Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, results of operations, capital requirements,\nour financial condition, contractual restrictions, including the terms of the agreements governing our debt and any future\nindebtedness we may incur and other relevant factors. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to pay\nquarterly cash dividends at the current rate or at all.\nOn October 28, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with an indefinite duration for up to\n$425.0 million of the Company’s common stock. This share repurchase program operated alongside our previous $75.0\nmillion share repurchase authorization, which began on November 4, 2020 and expired on December 26, 2021. In fiscal\n2021, approximately 594,000 shares with an aggregate cost of $72.5 million and an average price of $121.96 per share\nwere repurchased under these programs. Funding for the share repurchase programs were provided through our operating\ncash flows and our $600.0 million PJI Revolving Facility.\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase activity by fiscal period during the fourth quarter ended December 26,\n2021 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTotal Number M aximum Dollar\nTotal Average of Shares Purchased Value of Shares\nNumber Price as Part of Publicly that May Yet Be\nof Shares Paid per Announced Plans Purchased Under the\nFiscal Period Purchased Share or Programs Plans or Programs\n9/27/2021 - 10/24/2021 132 $ 126.44 132 $ 35,026\n10/25/2021 - 11/21/2021 70 $ 125.25 70 $ 451,219\n11/22/2021 - 12/26/2021 205 $ 128.84 205 $ 424,800\nTotal 407 $ 127.44 407 $ 424,800\nSubsequent to year-end, we acquired an additional 109,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $13.3 million.\nApproximately $411.5 million remained available under the Company’s share repurchase program as of February 17,\n2022.\nThe Company utilizes a written trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,\nfrom time to time to facilitate the repurchase of shares of our common stock under this share repurchase program. There\ncan be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock either through a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or\notherwise.\nThe information required by Item 5 with respect to securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is\nincorporated herein by reference to Part III, Item 12 of this Form 10-K.\n27\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following performance graph compares the cumulative shareholder return of the Company’s common stock for the\nfive-year period between December 25, 2016 and December 26, 2021 to (i) the Nasdaq US Benchmark TR Index and (ii) a\ngroup of the Company’s peers consisting of U.S. companies listed on Nasdaq with standard industry classification (SIC)\ncodes 5800-5899 (eating and drinking places).

Intentionally Omitted\n28\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nPapa John’s International, Inc. (referred to as the “Company,” “Papa John’s” or in the first-person notations of “we,” “us”\nand “our”) began operations in 1984. At December 26, 2021, there were 5,650 Papa John’s restaurants in operation,\nconsisting of 600 Company-owned and 5,050 franchised restaurants. Our revenues are derived from retail sales of pizza\nand other food and beverage products to the general public by Company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties, and sales\nof franchise and development rights. Additionally, approximately 47% of our North America revenues in each of the last\ntwo fiscal years were derived from sales to franchisees of various items including food and paper products from our\ndomestic Quality Control Centers (“QC Centers”), operation of our international QC Center in the United Kingdom\n(“UK”), contributions received by Papa John’s Marketing Fund (“PJMF”) which is our national marketing fund, printing\nand promotional items and information systems equipment, and software and related services. We believe that in addition\nto supporting both Company and franchised profitability and growth, these activities contribute to product quality and\nconsistency throughout the Papa John’s system.\nRecent Business Matters\nIn 2021, the Company focused on executing strategic priorities and building a foundation for long-term success, including\nthe specific items described below.\nGrowth Strategy. The Company delivered its tenth consecutive quarter of system-wide sales growth and continues to\nexpand both domestically and internationally, as evidenced by our comparable sales and restaurant unit growth. Our two-\nyear comparable sales increases were 29.4% in North America and 25.6% internationally, driven by menu innovation and\ncustomer retention. Product innovation is an important part of our plan to continue building sales and also represents our\nplatform for longer-term strategy and opportunity. Additionally, our expanding development pipeline is on track to be a\nkey long-term growth driver. In 2021, we announced one of our largest domestic development deals to open 100 new\nlocations in high growth markets in Texas and the South by 2029. We also announced our expanded partnership with\nDrake Food Service International to open over 220 Papa John’s restaurants internationally by 2025, and most recently\nannounced a partnership with FountainVest Partners to open more than 1,350 new stores across South China by 2040, the\nlargest franchisee development agreement in Papa John’s history. We plan to continue focusing on our strategic innovative\nproducts and restaurant development across our platforms to drive sustainable growth this year and beyond.\nCapital Allocation Strategy. During 2021, we executed on key components of our capital structure and allocation strategy\nby aligning our capital structure to support the long-term growth potential of the Company. During the fourth quarter of\n2021, we announced a $425.0 million share repurchase program. Earlier in the year, we issued $400.0 million of 3.875%\nsenior notes which will mature on September 15, 2029 and concurrently refinanced our revolving credit facility. We also\nincreased our annual dividend rate and completed the repurchase and conversion of all of our Series B Convertible\nPreferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”). This strategic capital realignment will allow us to deliver on our broader\ngrowth strategy and provide ongoing value to our shareholders.\nCoronavirus (“COVID-19”) and Related Market Impact. The COVID-19 outbreak has presented evolving risks and\ndevelopments domestically and internationally, as well as new opportunities for our business. Our delivery and carryout\nmodel positioned us to continue to experience strong demand for our products. Increased demand partly driven by changes\nin consumer behavior during the pandemic contributed to our strong comparable sales growth during 2021 and 2020. To\nensure we can continue to meet the demand of our customers, we continue to monitor our supply chain and labor force\navailability. We have recently experienced inflation in commodities prices, including food ingredients, which has increased\nour operating expenses. Our ability to attract and retain hourly employees in our restaurants has also become more\nchallenging, especially as the job market has become more competitive. We have continued to address labor shortages\nduring 2021 through new hiring, referral and appreciation bonuses in the Company’s corporate restaurants and supply\nchain, holding national recruiting events, supplementing delivery drivers with delivery aggregator partnerships as needed\nand technology advancements. We expect labor and inflationary cost challenges, including the impact on store\ndevelopment, to be a continued priority focus for us in 2022. We continue to monitor the progression of the COVID-19\npandemic and state, local and federal government regulatory and public health responses thereto, including the federal\n29\nOccupational Health and Safety Administration’s efforts to implement a nationwide vaccine requirement for large\nemployers.\nWe believe the pandemic has accelerated our efforts to innovate and bring new customers to the Papa John’s system. While\nwe believe that as the pandemic-related restrictions are lifted, we will benefit in the long-term from the increase in\ncustomers we have experienced during the duration of the pandemic due to our menu innovation, customer loyalty program\nand our offerings of high-quality pizza and other menu items, we do not expect to be able to maintain the same level of\nannual growth rates in comparable sales and revenues in the future.\nStrategic Corporate Reorganization for Long-term Growth. Our corporate office in Atlanta, Georgia located in Three\nBallpark Center at The Battery Atlanta opened in October 2021. The Atlanta office is part of a broader strategic\nreorganization of corporate functions reflecting the Company’s ongoing transformation into a brand and culture that can\neffectively and efficiently deliver on the Company’s purpose, values and strategic business priorities. Affected employees\nwho did not relocate to Atlanta were offered a separation package. As a result, we incurred certain one-time corporate\nreorganization costs of approximately $19.1 million related to employee severance and transition, recruitment and\nrelocation and other third-party costs from the fourth quarter of 2020 through 2021. Of that amount, we incurred costs of\napproximately $13.1 million in 2021 and $6.0 million in 2020. Looking forward to 2022, our one-time corporate\nreorganization costs are substantially complete and we do not anticipate that any significant remaining reorganization costs\nwill be incurred. See “Items Impacting Comparability; Non-GAAP Measures” for additional information.\nPresentation of Financial Results\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of Consolidated Financial\nStatements requires management to select accounting policies for critical accounting areas as well as estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s significant\naccounting policies, including recently issued accounting pronouncements, are more fully described in “Note 2” of “Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements.” A number of our significant accounting policies are critical due to the fact that they\ninvolve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our\nfinancial condition or results of operations. Significant changes in assumptions and/or conditions in our critical accounting\npolicies could materially impact the operating results.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Franchisee Notes Receivable\nThe Company has provided financing (recorded as notes receivable) to select domestic and international franchisees\nprincipally for use in the construction and development of their restaurants and for the purchase of restaurants from the\nCompany or other franchisees. Most notes receivable bear interest at fixed or floating rates and are generally secured by\nthe assets of each restaurant and the ownership interests in the franchise. The Company has also provided long-term\nfinancing to certain franchisees with royalty payment plans.\nThe Company establishes an allowance for credit losses on franchisee notes receivables when it is more likely than not\nthat some portion or all of the balance will not be realized. The allowance for credit losses on notes receivable is highly\njudgmental and subjective based on management’s judgments of each franchisee’s economic performance and future\nmarket conditions. The Company considers each individual note receivable separately for evaluation of its allowance for\ncredit losses which represent specific reserve calculations, except for certain notes receivable issued related to equipment\ndevelopment incentives where a general portfolio reserve exists supported by historical write-off experiences. Included\nin the terms of the notes receivable agreements, the Company is provided collateral rights of the franchisee’s stores (e.g.,\nunderlying franchise business, property and equipment) and personal guarantees from the operators to recover the carrying\nvalue of the outstanding note receivable in the event collectability concerns arise. As a result, the Company also considers\nthe fair value of the underlying collateral rights (e.g., underlying franchisee business, property and equipment) and any\nguarantees when assessing the allowance for credit losses (which may require third-party valuations of fair value). Further,\nthe Company also considers overall franchisee credit quality, which is monitored through the timing of payments compared\n30\nto the prescribed payment terms and known facts regarding the financial condition of the franchisee or customer, including\nmetrics such as comparable store sales of the franchisees operations and weekly per store sales averages. Notes receivable\nbalances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased.\nFranchisee notes receivable was $49.4 million with an allowance for credit losses of $1.5 million as of December 26, 2021\ncompared to $51.1 million with an allowance for credit losses of $3.2 million as of December 27, 2020.\nInsurance Reserves\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability and property\ninsurance coverage provided to our employees are funded by the Company up to certain retention. Retention limits range\nup to $1.0 million. We record the liability for losses based upon undiscounted estimates of the liability for claims incurred\nand for events that have occurred but have not been reported using certain third-party actuarial projections and our\nhistorical claims loss experience.\nAs of December 26, 2021, our insurance reserves were $88.1 million as compared to $82.0 million at December 27, 2020.\nOur insurance reserves primarily relate to auto liability and workers’ compensation claims and includes the gross up of\nclaims above our retention levels, with a corresponding receivable recorded in Prepaid and other current assets and Other\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The insurance reserves represent the mid-point of the range as determined by\nour actuarial analysis, which considered various actuarial valuation methodologies. The determination of the recorded\ninsurance reserves is highly complex due to the significant uncertainty in the potential value of reported claims and the\nnumber and potential value of incurred but not reported claims.\nIncome Tax Accounts and Tax Reserves\nPapa John’s is subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining Papa John’s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for\nincome taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable and those deferred. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are\nmeasured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax\nassets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax attribute carryforwards (e.g., net operating losses, capital\nlosses, and foreign tax credits). The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which\nthe new tax rate is enacted.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts\nwe expect to realize and were $28.6 million and $23.0 million as of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020,\nrespectively. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is based on the evaluation of historical\nprofitability, future market growth, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary\ndifferences and tax planning strategies. The Company assesses deferred taxes and the adequacy or need for a valuation\nallowance on a quarterly basis.\nTax authorities periodically audit the Company. We record reserves and related interest and penalties for identified\nexposures as income tax expense. We evaluate these issues and adjust for events, such as statute of limitations expirations,\ncourt rulings or audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures.\nIn the event the Company is unable to generate future taxable income, there is a material change in the actual effective tax\nrates, the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the tax laws\nchange unfavorably, then we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, resulting in\nan increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate. Each change of income tax expense of $1.5 million would\nimpact the fiscal 2021 effective tax rate by one percentage point. See “Note 17” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements” for additional information.\n31\nGlobal Restaurant Sales and Unit Information\n“Comparable sales” represents the change in year-over-year sales for the same base of restaurants for the same fiscal\nperiods. “Global system-wide restaurant sales” represents total restaurant sales for all company-owned and franchised\nstores open during the comparable periods, and “Global system-wide restaurant sales growth” represents the change in\ntotal system restaurant sales year-over-year. We believe North America, international and global restaurant and\ncomparable sales growth and Global system-wide restaurant sales information is useful in analyzing our results since our\nfranchisees pay royalties and marketing fund contributions that are based on a percentage of franchise sales. Comparable\nsales and Global system-wide restaurant sales results for restaurants operating outside of the United States are reported on\na constant dollar basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. Franchise sales also generate\ncommissary revenue in the United States and in certain international markets. Franchise restaurant and comparable sales\ngrowth information is also useful for comparison to industry trends and evaluating the strength of our brand. Management\nbelieves the presentation of franchise restaurant sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, provides investors\nwith useful information regarding underlying sales trends and the impact of new unit growth without being impacted by\nswings in the external factor of foreign currency. Franchise restaurant sales are not included in the Company’s revenues.\nYear En ded\nDecember 26, 2021 December 27, 2020\nComparable sales growth:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants 11.3% 14.2%\nNorth America franchised restaurants 12.0% 18.6%\nNorth America restaurants 11.8% 17.6%\nInternational restaurants 13.0% 12.6%\nTotal comparable sales growth 12.1% 16.3%\nSystem-wide restaurant sales growth:\n(excluding the impact of foreign currency)\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants 11.1% 7.5%\nNorth America franchised restaurants 13.0% 18.7%\nNorth America restaurants 12.6% 16.0%\nInternational restaurants 24.4% 15.5%\nTotal global system-wide restaurant sales growth 15.4% 15.9%\nRestaurant Progression Year End ed\nDecember 26, 2021 December 27, 2020\nNorth America Company-owned:\nBeginning of period 588 598\nOpened 11 2\nClosed — (12)\nAcquired 1 —\nEnd of period 600 588\nNorth America franchised:\nBeginning of period 2,701 2,690\nOpened 74 62\nClosed (35) (51)\nSold (1) —\nEnd of period 2,739 2,701\nInternational franchised:\nBeginning of period 2,111 2,107\nOpened 304 156\nClosed (104) (152)\nEnd of period 2,311 2,111\nTotal restaurants – end of period 5,650 5,400\nFull year net store growth 250 5\n32\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December of each year.

The increase was primarily due to\npositive comparable sales of 11.3%, which were positively impacted by new product innovation, including the successful\nlaunch of our new Epic Stuffed Crust pizza in the first quarter of 2021, and due to higher demand that has been sustained\nduring the pandemic, which was not reflected in the first quarter of 2020.\n33\nNorth America franchise royalties and fees increased $32.6 million, or 33.7%, in 2021. The increase was primarily due to\npositive comparable sales of 12.0% and a higher effective royalty rate from higher franchise royalties of $14.3 million in\n2021 as a result of ending our temporary franchise assistance program in the third quarter of 2020. The franchise assistance\nprogram was above and beyond the level of franchise assistance the Company would incur in the ordinary course of its\nbusiness.\nNorth America franchise restaurant sales increased 13.0% to $2.8 billion for 2021 compared to prior year. North America\nfranchise restaurant sales are not included in Company revenues; however, our North America franchise royalties are\nderived from these sales.\nNorth America commissary revenues increased $80.5 million, or 11.8%, primarily due to higher volumes and higher\npricing from higher commodities costs.\nInternational revenues increased $26.8 million, or 21.6% in 2021 primarily due to higher royalties from increased\nequivalent units and higher comparable sales of 13.0%. International revenues also increased $8.1 million in 2021 due to\nfavorable foreign exchange rates. “Equivalent units” represents the number of restaurants open at the beginning of a given\nperiod, adjusted for restaurants opened, closed, acquired or sold during the period on a weighted average basis.\nInternational franchise restaurant sales increased 24.4% to $1.2 billion in 2021, excluding the impact of foreign currency,\nprimarily due to increases in comparable sales and net new restaurant openings. International franchise restaurant sales are\nnot included in Company revenues; however, our international royalty revenue is derived from these sales.\nOther revenues, which primarily includes our national marketing funds, online and mobile ordering business and our\nwholly-owned print and promotions subsidiary, increased $37.7 million, or 17.9% in 2021 primarily due to higher\nmarketing fund revenues from an increase in franchise sales and higher revenues from our technology platform, including\nour mobile ordering business which benefited from increased restaurant sales.\nCosts and Expenses\nTotal costs and expenses were approximately $1.90 billion, or 91.9% of total revenues in 2021, as compared to $1.7 billion,\nor 95.0% of total revenues for the prior year. The decrease in total costs and expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were\nprimarily due to the following:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurant expenses were $621.9 million or 79.9% of related revenues in 2021, compared to\nexpenses of $563.8 million, or 80.5% of related revenues for the prior year. The 0.6% decrease in expenses, as a percentage\nof revenues, was primarily due to leveraging fixed costs on higher revenues, partially offset by higher commodity and\nlabor costs.\nNorth America commissary expenses were $703.6 million, or 92.4% of related revenues in 2021, compared to $630.9\nmillion, or 92.7% of related revenues, for the prior year. The 0.3% decrease in expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was\nprimarily due to leveraging fixed costs on higher revenues.\nInternational expenses were $87.3 million, or 57.9% of related revenues, for 2021 compared to $74.0 million, or 59.7% of\nrelated revenues for the prior year. The 1.8% decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower\noperating costs on higher royalties from a 13.0% increase in comparable sales for 2021 and the favorable impact of foreign\ncurrency exchange rates in 2021.\nOther expenses were $226.3 million, or 91.0% of related revenues in 2021, as compared to $200.3 million, or 94.9% of\nrelated revenues for the prior year. The 3.9% decrease in expenses, as a percentage of related revenues, was primarily due\nto higher margins from our technology platform, including our mobile ordering business.\n34\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $212.3 million, or 10.3% of revenues for 2021 compared to $204.2\nmillion, or 11.3% of revenues for 2020. G&A expenses consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nYear En d ed\nDecember 26, December 27,\n2021 2020\nAdministrative expenses (a) $ 199,452 $ 185,202\nSpecial items (b) 13,094 5,985\nOther general expenses (c) (281) 13,055\nGeneral and administrative expenses $ 212,265 $ 204,242\n(a) The increase in administrative expenses of $14.3 million for the year ended December 26, 2021 compared to prior\nyear was primarily due to higher professional and legal fees and travel and labor costs.\n(b) Represents $13.1 million and $6.0 million in strategic reorganization costs for the years ended December 26, 2021\nand December 27, 2020, respectively, associated with the opening of our new office in Atlanta, Georgia. See\n“Note 16” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\n(c) The decrease in other general expenses of $13.3 million in 2021 was primarily due to discretionary marketing fund\ninvestments of $15.0 million which was part of our temporary franchisee assistance program that concluded in the\nthird quarter of 2020.\nSee “Items Impacting Comparability; Non-GAAP Measures” for additional information regarding the Special items.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $48.8 million, or 2.4% of revenues in 2021,\nas compared to $49.7 million, or 2.7% of revenues for 2020. The 0.3% decrease is primarily due to higher revenues in\n2021.\nOperating Income by Segment\nOperating income is summarized in the following table on a reporting segment basis. Operating income increased\napproximately $78.0 million for the year ended December 26, 2021 as compared to the prior year. Alongside the GAAP\noperating income data, we have included “adjusted” operating income to exclude Special items. Special items in 2021 and\n2020 consist of strategic corporate reorganization costs associated with our corporate office in Atlanta, Georgia. The\nreconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, as well as the Special items, are included in “Items Impacting\nComparability; Non-GAAP Measures.” We believe these non-GAAP measures are important for comparability purposes.\nY e ar Ended\nReported Special Adjusted Reported Special Adjusted Adjusted\nDec. 26, items Dec. 26, Dec. 27, items Dec. 27, Increase\n(In thousands) 2021 in 2021 2021 2020 in 2020 2020 (Decrease)\nDomestic Company-owned\nrestaurants $ 49,628 $ — $ 49,628 $ 37,049 $ — $ 37,049 $ 12,579\nNorth America franchising 120,949 — 120,949 89,801 — 89,801 31,148\nNorth America commissaries 39,873 — 39,873 33,185 — 33,185 6,688\nInternational 34,896 — 34,896 24,034 — 24,034 10,862\nAll others 17,704 — 17,704 7,043 — 7,043 10,661\nUnallocated corporate\nexpenses (94,114) 13,094 (81,020) (100,069) 5,985 (94,084) 13,064\nElimination of intersegment\n(profits) (695) — (695) (790) — (790) 95\nTotal $ 168,241 $ 13,094 $ 181,335 $ 90,253 $ 5,985 $ 96,238 $ 85,097\n35\nThe increase in operating income, excluding Special items, of $85.1 million, or 88.4% in 2021 compared to 2020 was\nprimarily due to the following:\n Domestic Company-owned restaurants increased $12.6 million in 2021 primarily due to higher profits from\ncomparable sales increases of 11.3%, partially offset by higher commodities and labor costs.\n North America franchising increased $31.1 million in 2021 primarily due to higher comparable sales of 12.0%\nand a higher effective royalty rate from higher franchise royalties of $14.3 million driven by the conclusion of\nour temporary royalty reduction program in the third quarter of 2020. This temporary royalty support was above\nand beyond the level of franchise assistance the Company would incur in the ordinary course of its business.\n North America commissaries increased $6.7 million in 2021 primarily due to higher profits from higher volumes.\n International increased approximately $10.9 million in 2021 primarily due to higher royalty revenue from\ncomparable sales of 13.0% and increased equivalent units.\n All Others, which primarily includes our online and mobile ordering business and our marketing funds, increased\n$10.7 million in 2021 primarily due to higher revenues from our technology platform, including our mobile\nordering business.\n Unallocated corporate expenses decreased approximately $13.1 million in 2021 primarily due to our discretionary\nmarketing fund investments of $15.0 million in 2020 which was part of our previously announced franchise\nassistance program that concluded in the third quarter of 2020. This decrease was partially offset by higher travel\nand labor costs.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased approximately $2.2 million for the year ended December 26, 2021 primarily\ndue to higher interest rate for our senior notes and higher average outstanding debt on our revolving credit facility drawn\nto partially fund the repurchase and conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock. Total debt outstanding was $490.0 million\nand $350.0 million as of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively.\nIncome before income taxes. Income before income taxes was $150.9 million in 2021, compared to $75.4 million in 2020,\nor an increase of $75.5 million due to the reasons discussed above.\nIncome tax expense. The effective income tax rate was 17.2% for 2021, compared to 19.6% for 2020. The effective rate\nwas lower in 2021 due to the finalization of our 2020 federal income tax return, which resulted in a $2.7 million benefit to\nincome tax expense. The rate also included excess tax benefits from stock option exercise and restricted shares vesting\nactivity. The following compares income tax expense for 2021 and 2020:\nYear En de d\nDecember 26, 2021 December 27, 2020\nIncome before income taxes $ 150,948 $ 75,362\nIncome tax expense $ 25,993 $ 14,748\nEffective tax rate 17.2% 19.6%\nSee “Items Impacting Comparability; Non-GAAP Measures” and “Note 7” and “Note 17” of “Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements,” for additional information.\nDiluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per common share was $0.12 for 2021 compared to diluted earnings per\ncommon share of $1.28 in 2020, representing a decrease of $1.16. Excluding Special items, adjusted diluted earnings per\ncommon share was $3.51 in 2021, compared to $1.40 in 2020, representing an increase of $2.11. Diluted earnings per\ncommon share for the year ended December 26, 2021 included $3.10 from a reduction in net income attributable to\ncommon shareholders related to the repurchase and conversion of all shares of previously outstanding Series B Preferred\nStock during the second quarter. This reduction reflects the excess of the one-time cash payment over the carrying value\nof the Series B Preferred Stock. See “Note 6” and “Note 7” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional\ninformation.\n36\nItems Impacting Comparability; Non-GAAP Measures\nThe table below reconciles our GAAP financial results to our adjusted financial results, which are non-GAAP measures\n(collectively defined as “Special items”). We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe the Special items\nimpact the comparability of our results of operations. See “Note 6”, “Note 16”, and “Note 17” of “Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements,” for additional information about the Special items.\nYear En de d\nDec. 26, Dec. 27,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 2021 2020\n(Note)\nGAAP operating income $ 168,241 $ 90,253\nStrategic corporate reorganization costs (1) 13,094 5,985\nAdjusted operating income $ 181,335 $ 96,238\nGAAP net income attributable to common shareholders $ 4,073 $ 41,737\nStrategic corporate reorganization costs (1) 13,094 5,985\nRepurchase and conversion of Series B Preferred Stock (2) 109,852 —\nTax effect of strategic corporate reorganization costs (3) (2,946) (1,346)\nTwo-class impact for Non-GAAP adjustment to net income (4) — (662)\nAdjusted net income attributable to common shareholders $ 124,073 $ 45,714\nGAAP diluted earnings per common share $ 0.12 $ 1.28\nStrategic corporate reorganization costs (1) 0.37 0.18\nRepurchase and conversion of Series B Preferred Stock (2) 3.10 —\nTax effect of strategic corporate reorganization costs (3) (0.08) (0.04)\nTwo-class impact for Non-GAAP adjustment to net income (4) — (0.02)\nAdjusted diluted earnings per common share $ 3.51 $ 1.40\n(Note) The above table does not include the impact of the allocation of undistributed earnings to participating securities\nfor Special items in 2021.\n(1) Represents strategic corporate reorganization costs associated with our new office in Atlanta, Georgia.\n(2) Represents the one-time charge related to the repurchase and conversion of all shares of Series B Preferred Stock and\nincludes related professional fees incurred as part of the transaction.\n(3) The tax effect for strategic corporate reorganization costs was calculated by applying the marginal tax rate of 22.5%\nfor 2021 and 2020, respectively. There was no tax effect on the repurchase and conversion of the Series B Preferred\nStock as the one-time charge was non-deductible for tax purposes.\n(4) Represents an adjustment to the allocation of undistributed earnings to participating securities for the strategic\ncorporate reorganization costs.\nThe non-GAAP adjusted results shown above and within this document, which exclude the Special items, should not be\nconstrued as a substitute for or a better indicator of the Company’s performance than the Company’s GAAP results.\nManagement believes presenting certain financial information excluding the Special items is important for purposes of\ncomparing our historical operating results and providing transparency in how we evaluate our operating performance.\nManagement uses these metrics to evaluate the Company’s underlying operating performance and to analyze trends.\nIn addition, we present free cash flow in this report, which is a non-GAAP measure. Please see “Liquidity and Capital\nResources – Free Cash Flow” for a discussion of why we believe free cash flow provides useful information regarding our\nfinancial condition and results of operations, and a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasure.\nThe presentation of the non-GAAP measures in this report is made alongside the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasures.\n37\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows from continuing operations for each of the last two fiscal years (in thousands):\n2021 2020\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 184,675 $ 186,439\nInvesting activities (63,512) (41,071)\nFinancing activities (180,526) (43,461)\nChange in cash and cash equivalents, excluding the impact of foreign currency $ (59,363) $ 101,907\nOperating Activities\nTotal cash provided by operating activities was $184.7 million for the year ended December 26, 2021 which was generally\nconsistent with the prior year comparable period. The Company benefited from strong comparable sales growth of 12.1%\nin 2021 driven by our product innovation, customer retention and expansion both domestically and internationally, which\nmore than doubled our net income to $125.0 million from $60.6 million a year ago. This was offset by unfavorable changes\nin working capital, including the repayment of previously deferred employer payroll taxes from the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act and the timing of payments associated with our national marketing fund.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flow used in investing activities was $63.5 million in 2021 compared to $41.1 million in 2020. The increase of $22.4\nmillion was primarily driven by a $32.9 million increase in capital spend as part of our long-term growth strategy and\nexpansion both domestically and internationally, including expenditures for the buildout of our corporate office located in\nAtlanta, Georgia, information technology upgrades for our corporate and restaurant facilities, and the development of\nCompany-owned restaurants. This was partially offset by higher repayments from notes issued to franchisees.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flow used in financing activities was $180.5 million in 2021 compared to $43.5 million in 2020, an increase of $137.0\nmillion. During 2021, the Company executed a new capital allocation strategy to optimize its capital structure, accelerating\nour long-term earnings potential and providing ongoing value to our shareholders. This strategy included cash\nconsideration paid for the repurchase of the Company’s outstanding shares of Series B Preferred stock totaling $188.6\nmillion, share repurchases made under the Company’s share repurchase programs of $72.5 million, and an increase to our\ndividend rate per common share, from $0.90 to $1.40 on an annual basis. These cash uses were partially offset by net\nproceeds of $60.0 million from the issuance of our 3.875% senior notes due 2029 and refinancing of our revolving credit\nfacility, and also $80.0 million in net proceeds received from our revolving credit facility which were mainly used to fund\nour share repurchases.\nDebt\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company issued $400.0 million of 3.875% senior notes (the “Notes”) which will mature on\nSeptember 15, 2029. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into an amended and restated\ncredit agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) replacing the previous credit agreement (“Previous Credit\nAgreement”). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate\navailable principal amount of $600.0 million (the “PJI Revolving Facility”), of which up to $40.0 million is available as\nswingline loans and up to $80.0 million is available as letters of credit. The PJI Revolving Facility will mature on\nSeptember 14, 2026.\nThe net proceeds from the Notes, together with borrowings under the PJI Revolving Facility, were used to repay\noutstanding revolver and term loan borrowings under the Company’s Previous Credit Agreement.\n38\nOur outstanding debt as of December 26, 2021 was $490.0 million, which was comprised of $400.0 million outstanding\nunder the Notes and $90.0 million outstanding under the PJI Revolving Facility. Remaining availability under the PJI\nRevolving Facility was approximately $510.0 million as of December 26, 2021.\nOur Amended Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, require customary\nreporting obligations and restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, the\nconsummation of certain mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and similar transactions, the making of investments,\nequity distributions and other restricted payments, and transactions with affiliates. The Company is also subject to certain\nfinancial covenants, as shown in the following table, that could restrict or impose constraints on the liquidity of our\nbusiness:\nActual Ratio for the\nYear Ended\nPermitted Ratio December 26, 2021\nLeverage ratio Not to exceed 5.25 to 1.0 2.0 to 1.0\nInterest coverage ratio Not less than 2.00 to 1.0 5.0 to 1.0\nOur leverage ratio is defined as outstanding debt divided by consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization (“EBITDA”) for the most recent four fiscal quarters. Our interest coverage ratio is defined as the sum of\nconsolidated EBITDA and consolidated rental expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters divided by the sum of\nconsolidated interest expense and consolidated rental expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters. We were in\ncompliance with all financial covenants as of December 26, 2021.\nIn addition, the Indenture governing the Notes contains customary covenants that, among other things and subject to certain\nexceptions, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness and guarantee\nindebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock; prepay, redeem or\nrepurchase certain debt; issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; make loans and investments; sell assets;\nincur liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay\ndividends; and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nPapa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”), our national marketing fund, has a $20.0 million revolving line of credit (the\n“PJMF Revolving Facility”) pursuant to a Revolving Loan Agreement, dated September 30, 2015 with U.S. Bank National\nAssociation, as lender. There was no debt outstanding under the PJMF Revolving Facility as of December 26, 2021 or\nDecember 27, 2020. The PJMF operating results and the related debt outstanding do not impact the financial covenants\nunder the Amended Credit Agreement.\nSee “Note 12” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\nShare Repurchases\nAs part of our long-term growth and capital allocation strategy, we are committed to investing in share repurchases to\nprovide ongoing value and enhanced returns to our shareholders. On October 28, 2021, our Board of Directors approved\na share repurchase program with an indefinite duration for up to $425.0 million of the Company’s common stock. The\nshare repurchase program operated alongside our previous $75.0 million share repurchase authorization, which began on\nNovember 4, 2020 and expired on December 26, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase activity for the years ended December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020:\nMaximum Dollar\nTotal Average Aggregate Value of Shares\nNumber Price Cost of that May Yet Be\n(in thousands, except average price per share) of Shares Paid per Shares Purchased Under the\nYear Ended Purchased Share Purchased Plans or Programs\nDecember 26, 2021 594 $ 121.96 $ 72,499 $ 424,800\nDecember 27, 2020 32 $ 83.90 $ 2,701 $ 72,299\n39\nSubsequent to year-end, we acquired an additional 109,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $13.3 million. Approximately\n$411.5 million remained available under the Company’s share repurchase program as of February 17, 2022.\nThe Company utilizes a written trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,\nfrom time to time to facilitate the repurchase of shares of our common stock under this share repurchase program. There\ncan be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock either through a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or\notherwise.\nDividends\nThe Company recorded dividends of approximately $46.0 million for the year ended December 26, 2021 consisting of the\nfollowing:\n $40.4 million paid to common stockholders ($1.15 per share);\n $3.0 million in preferred dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock (3.6% of the investment per annum);\n $1.5 million of common stock deemed dividend distributions in conjunction with the repurchase and conversion\nof the Series B Preferred Stock; and\n $1.1 million in common stock “pass-through” dividends paid to Series B Preferred Stockholders on an as-\nconverted basis ($0.45 per share).\nThe Company paid common stock dividends of $29.4 million, common stock “pass-through” dividends to Series B\nPreferred Stockholders of $4.6 million, and $9.1 million in preferred dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock in 2020.\nOn January 27, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock,\nrepresenting an approximate $12.7 million aggregate dividend that was paid on February 18, 2022 to common stockholders\nof record as of the close of business on February 7, 2022. The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at\nthe discretion of our Board of Directors.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (from the Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flows) less the purchases of property and equipment and dividends paid to preferred stockholders. We\nview free cash flow as an important financial measure because it is one factor that management uses in determining the\namount of cash available for discretionary investment. Free cash flow is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our\nmeasure of free cash flow might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash flow\nshould not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the Company’s performance than the Company’s GAAP\nmeasures.\nThe Company’s free cash flow for the last two years was as follows (in thousands):\nYear En de d\nDecember 26, December 27,\n2021 2020\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 184,675 $ 186,439\nPurchases of property and equipment (68,559) (35,652)\nDividends paid to preferred stockholders (1) (6,394) (13,649)\nFree cash flow $ 109,722 $ 137,138\n(1) Excludes $188.6 million of cash consideration paid for the repurchase and conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock\nin the second quarter of 2021.\n40\nCash Requirements\nThe Company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity, along with cash generated\nby operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements, cash dividends, interest payments and share repurchases\nover the next twelve months and beyond.\nThe Company’s material cash requirements as of December 26, 2021 include the following contractual obligations\n(in thousands):\nPay m en ts Due by Pe ri od\nLess than After 5\n1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years Total\nContractual Obligations:\n3.875% Senior Notes $ — $ — $ — $ 400,000 $ 400,000\nRevolving Facility — — 90,000 — 90,000\nInterest payments (1) 23,299 36,150 34,600 46,500 140,549\nTotal debt $ 23,299 $ 36,150 $ 124,600 $ 446,500 $ 630,549\nOperating leases (2) 33,323 63,243 49,521 96,187 242,274\nFinance leases (2) 5,969 10,791 5,507 1,748 24,015\nTotal contractual obligations $ 62,591 $ 110,184 $ 179,628 $ 544,435 $ 896,838\n(1) Interest payments assume an outstanding debt balance of $490.0 million. Interest payments are calculated based on\nLIBOR plus the applicable margin in effect at December 26, 2021, and includes the impact of interest rate swap\nagreements in effect. The actual interest rates on our variable rate debt and the amount of our indebtedness could vary\nfrom those used to compute the above interest payments. See “Note 12” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements” for additional information concerning our debt and credit arrangements.\n(2) See “Note 3” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. The above amounts exclude\nvariable-based rents and future expected sub-lease income in the UK.\nThe above table does not include the following:\n Unrecognized tax benefits of $0.9 million, including interest and penalties, since we are not able to make\nreasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement with respect to the taxing authority.\n Redeemable noncontrolling interests of $5.5 million as we are not able to predict the timing of the redemptions.\n Expected capital expenditures of approximately $75.0 million to $85.0 million in 2022, which the Company\nexpects to spend primarily on the buildout and development of Company-owned stores and technological\nenhancements.\nImpact of Inflation\nFrom time to time, we experience the impacts of inflation, which cause increased food, labor and benefits costs and higher\noperating expenses. To the extent permitted by competition, increased costs are recovered through a combination of menu\nprice increases and/or implementing other cost reductions.\n41\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe guarantee leases for certain Papa John’s North American franchisees who have purchased restaurants that were\npreviously Company-owned. We are contingently liable on these leases. These leases have varying terms, the latest of\nwhich expires in 2036. As of December 26, 2021, the estimated maximum amount of undiscounted payments the Company\ncould be required to make in the event of nonpayment by the primary lessees was approximately $11.5 million.\nWe have certain other commercial commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. With\nour insurance programs, we are party to surety bonds with off-balance sheet risk as follows by year (in thousands):\nAmou nt o f Comm it m ent Ex pir a tion Pe r P er iod\nLess than 1-3 3-5 After\n1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total\nSurety bonds $ 45,748 $ — $ — $ — $ 45,748\nThe surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses. See “Note 12” and “Note 19”\nof “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to contractual and other commitments.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other Company communications that are not statements\nof historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Generally, the\nuse of words such as “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “will,” “forecast,” “plan,” “project,” or similar\nwords identify forward-looking statements that we intend to be included within the safe harbor protections provided by\nthe federal securities laws. Such forward-looking statements include or may relate to projections or guidance concerning\nbusiness performance, revenue, earnings, cash flow, earnings per share, share repurchases, the financial impact of the\ntemporary business opportunities, disruptions and temporary changes in demand we are experiencing related to the current\noutbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions, commodity costs, currency fluctuations, profit margins,\nunit growth, unit level performance, capital expenditures, restaurant and franchise development, the duration of changes\nin consumer behavior caused by the pandemic, labor shortages, inflation, reorganization costs and the related\norganizational, employment and real estate changes from opening our new office in Atlanta, royalty relief, the effectiveness\nof our menu innovations and other business initiatives, marketing efforts, liquidity, compliance with debt covenants,\nstrategic decisions and actions, dividends, effective tax rates, regulatory changes and impacts, adoption of new accounting\nstandards, and other financial and operational measures.

Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those matters expressed or implied in such\nforward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are involved in our forward-looking statements\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n the ability of the Company to manage difficulties and opportunities associated with or related to the COVID-19\npandemic or the cessation thereof in the future, including risks related to: the impact of governmental restrictions\non freedom of movement and business operations including quarantines, social distancing requirements and\nmandatory business closures; changes in consumer demand or behavior; labor shortages at Company and/or\nfranchised stores and our quality control centers; impact of delayed new store openings, both domestically and\ninternationally; vaccine mandates; our ability to navigate changing governmental programs and regulations\nrelating to the pandemic; and the increased risk of phishing, ransomware and other cyber-attacks;\n our ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of our corporate reorganization and new office in Atlanta,\nGeorgia;\n increased costs for branding initiatives and launching new advertising and marketing campaigns and promotions\nto boost consumer sentiment and sales trends, and the risk that such initiatives will not be effective;\n risks related to social media, including publicity adversely and rapidly impacting our brand and reputation;\n aggressive changes in pricing or other marketing or promotional strategies by competitors, which may adversely\naffect sales and profitability; and new product and concept developments by food industry competitors;\n42\n changes in consumer preferences or consumer buying habits, including the growing popularity of delivery\naggregators, as well as changes in general economic conditions or other factors that may affect consumer\nconfidence and discretionary spending, including higher unemployment;\n the adverse impact on the Company or our results caused by global health concerns, product recalls, food quality\nor safety issues, incidences of foodborne illness, food contamination and other general public health concerns\nabout our Company-owned or franchised restaurants or others in the restaurant industry;\n the effectiveness of our technology investments and changes in unit-level operations;\n the ability of the Company and its franchisees to meet planned growth targets and operate new and existing\nrestaurants profitably, including difficulties finding qualified franchisees, store level employees or suitable sites;\n increases in labor costs, food costs or sustained higher other operating costs, including as a result of supply chain\ndisruption and inflation. This could also include increased employee compensation, including as a result of labor\nshortages, changes in minimum wage, benefits, insurance, tax rates, new regulatory requirements or increasing\ncompliance costs;\n increases in insurance claims and related costs for programs funded by the Company up to certain retention limits,\nincluding medical, owned and non-owned vehicles, workers’ compensation, general liability and property;\n disruption of our supply chain or commissary operations which could be caused by our sole source of supply of\nmozzarella cheese, desserts, garlic cups or limited source of suppliers for other key ingredients or more generally\ndue to weather, natural disasters including drought, disease, or geopolitical or other disruptions beyond our\ncontrol, including COVID-19;\n increased risks associated with our international operations, including economic and political conditions and risks\nassociated with the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, instability or uncertainty in our international\nmarkets, especially emerging markets, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulty in meeting planned sales\ntargets and new store growth;\n the impact of current or future claims and litigation and our ability to comply with current, proposed or future\nlegislation that could impact our business including compliance with the European Union General Data Protection\nRegulation;\n the Company's ability to continue to pay dividends to stockholders based upon profitability, cash flows and capital\nadequacy if restaurant sales and operating results decline;\n disruption of critical business or information technology systems, or those of our suppliers, and risks associated\nwith systems failures and data privacy and security breaches, including theft of confidential Company, employee\nand customer information, including payment cards; and\n changes in Federal or state income, general and other tax laws, rules and regulations and changes in generally\naccepted accounting principles.\nThese and other risk factors are discussed in detail in “Part I. Item 1A. — Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future\nevents, new information or otherwise, except as required by law.\n43\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on our PJI Revolving Facility. We attempt to minimize interest rate\nrisk exposure by fixing our interest rate through the utilization of interest rate swaps, which are derivative financial\ninstruments. The interest rate swaps were eligible for hedge accounting for part of the period and were de-designated\nfollowing the issuance of the Notes. Our swaps are entered into with financial institutions that participate in the PJI\nRevolving Facility. By using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we expose ourselves\nto credit risk due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We do\nnot enter into contracts for trading purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. See “Note 12” of “Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements” for additional information on our debt obligations and derivative instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from our operations outside of the United States, which\ncan adversely impact our revenues, net income and cash flows. Our international operations principally consist of\ndistribution sales to franchised Papa John’s restaurants located in the United Kingdom and our franchise sales and support\nactivities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our\ninternational franchisees. Approximately 7.3% of our 2021 revenues, 6.8% of our 2020 revenues and 7.8% of our 2019\nrevenues were derived from these international operations.\nWe have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations\nhad a favorable impact of approximately $8.1 million on our consolidated revenues in 2021 compared to an unfavorable\nimpact of approximately $600,000 in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $1.4 million on\nour operating income in 2021 compared to an unfavorable impact of $1.0 million in 2020. A 10% adverse change in the\nforeign currency rates for our international markets would result in an additional negative impact on annual revenue and\noperating income of approximately $15.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively.\nCommodity Price Risk\nIn the ordinary course of business, the food and paper products we purchase, including cheese (our largest ingredient cost),\nare subject to seasonal fluctuations, weather, availability, demand and other factors that are beyond our control. We have\npricing agreements with some of our vendors, including forward pricing agreements for a portion of our cheese purchases\nfor our domestic Company-owned restaurants, which are accounted for as normal purchases; however, we still remain\nexposed to on-going commodity volatility.\nThe following table presents the actual average block price for cheese by quarter in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Also presented\nis the projected 2022 average block price by quarter (based on the February 17, 2022 Chicago Mercantile Exchange cheese\nfutures prices):\n2022 2021 2020 2019\nProjected Block Block Block\nMarket Price Price Price\nQuarter 1 $ 1.956 $ 1.676 $ 1.857 $ 1.490\nQuarter 2 2.088 1.680 1.679 1.696\nQuarter 3 2.095 1.676 2.262 1.898\nQuarter 4 2.031 1.786 2.235 1.984\nFull Year $ 2.043 $ 1.705 $ 2.008 $ 1.767\n44\nItem 8.

In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company\nat December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 26, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2021, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 Framework), and our report dated February 24, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n46\nM easurement and valuation of insurance reserves\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\nis self-insured for certain obligations up to stated retention levels under its\nretention programs related to workers’ compensation, automobile, property\nand general liability programs. As of December 26, 2021, the Company has\n$88.1 million accrued for self-insurance reserves (“Insurance Reserves”).\nJudgments and estimates are used by the Company in determining the\npotential value associated with incurred but not reported claims.\nAuditing the valuation of the Insurance Reserves is highly judgmental and\ncomplex due to the significant uncertainty in estimating the potential value of\nreported claims, estimating the number and potential value of incurred but not\nreported claims and the use of actuarial valuation methods. The reserve\nestimate is sensitive to actuarial assumptions (e.g., future emergence of losses,\nincurred but not reported claims) used to estimate the ultimate liability for\nreported claims and claims that have been incurred but have not been reported.\nHow We Addressed the We tested controls related to the measurement and valuation of the Insurance\nMatter in Our Audit Reserves. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the\nassumptions and methods used to establish the estimate, the underlying data,\nsignificant actuarial assumptions and the related reconciliations.\nTo test the measurement and valuation of the Insurance Reserves, our audit\nprocedures included, among others, performing transactional tests of details\nover the completeness and accuracy of claims data and vouching payments\nmade to third parties. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to\nassist in the evaluation of the key assumptions and methodologies used by\nmanagement to determine the Insurance Reserves.\nMeasurement and valuation of allowance for credit losses for franchisee\nnotes receivable\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\nhas an allowance for credit losses for franchisee notes receivable of $1.5\nmillion (“Allowance for Credit Losses for Franchisee Notes Receivable”)\nagainst a gross balance of franchisee notes receivable of $49.4 million as of\nDecember 26, 2021. The Allowance for Credit Losses for Franchisee Notes\nReceivable is estimated to reduce the outstanding notes receivable for\nexpected credit losses after consideration of the fair value of the Company’s\ncollateral rights (e.g., underlying franchisee business, property and\nequipment) and any guarantees as well as a review of each franchisee’s\neconomic performance, historical loss information, current market conditions,\nand future economic conditions.\nAuditing the Allowance for Credit Losses for Franchisee Notes Receivable is\nchallenging due to the judgment inherent in estimating the fair value of the\nCompany’s collateral rights, which has a significant effect on measurement\nand valuation.\n47\nHow We Addressed the We tested controls related to the measurement and valuation of the Allowance\nMatter in Our Audit for Credit Losses for Franchisee Notes Receivable. For example, we tested\ncontrols over management’s review of the progression of outstanding notes\nreceivable and the Allowance for Credit Losses for Franchisee Notes\nReceivable and the overall review of its adequacy. Where judgment was\nexercised by management, our audit procedures included testing controls over\nmanagement’s evaluation of the assumptions, including the fair value of the\ncollateral rights and guarantees where collateral is available or personal\nguarantee given in connection with issuance of the applicable note. Our\ncontrol testing also considered management’s review over the completeness\nand accuracy of the underlying data used in evaluating the measurement and\nvaluation of the Allowance for Credit Losses for Franchisee Notes\nReceivable.\nTo test the measurement and valuation of the Allowance for Credit Losses for\nFranchisee Notes Receivable, our audit procedures included, among others,\nevaluating the status of collection of scheduled payments for outstanding\nnotes receivable, analyzing unit economics for franchisees to identify\nindicators of their financial health, evaluating the estimates of collateral value,\nand the underlying data used by management.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\nLouisville, Kentucky\nFebruary 24, 2022\n48\nPapa John’s

to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Description of Business\nPapa John’s International, Inc. (referred to as the “Company,” “Papa John’s” or in the first person notations of “we,” “us”\nand “our”), operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants under the trademark “Papa John’s,” in 50\ncountries and territories as of December 26, 2021. Our revenues are derived from retail sales of pizza and other food and\nbeverage products to the general public by Company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties and sales of franchise and\ndevelopment rights, printing and promotional items and information systems equipment, and software and related services.\nWe generated revenues from the operation of our Quality Control Centers (“QC Centers”) which supply pizza sauce,\ndough, food products, paper products, smallwares and cleaning supplies to restaurants. We also derived revenue from\ncontributions received by our national marketing funds.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Papa John’s International, Inc. and its\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December of each year. All fiscal years presented consist of 52 weeks.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and accompanying notes. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include\nthe allowance for credit losses on accounts and notes receivable, intangible assets, contract assets and contract liabilities\nincluding the customer loyalty program obligation, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, gift card breakage, insurance\nreserves and tax reserves. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could significantly differ from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in contracts with customers and excludes waivers or incentives and\namounts collected on behalf of third parties, primarily sales tax. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a\nperformance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Taxes assessed by a governmental\nauthority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the\nCompany from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Delivery costs, including freight associated with our domestic\ncommissary and other sales, are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in operating costs.\nThe following describes principal activities, separated by major product or service, from which the Company generates its\nrevenues:\nDomestic Company-owned Restaurant Sales\nThe domestic Company-owned restaurants principally generate revenue from retail sales of high-quality pizza, Papadias,\nwhich are flatbread-style sandwiches, and side items including breadsticks, cheesesticks, chicken poppers and wings,\ndessert items and canned or bottled beverages. Revenues from Company-owned restaurants are recognized when the\nproducts are delivered to or carried out by customers.\n55\nOur North American customer loyalty program, Papa Rewards, is a spend-based program that rewards customers with\npoints for each purchase. Papa Rewards points are accumulated and redeemed for dollar off discounts (“Papa Dough”) to\nbe used on future purchases within a six-month expiration window. The accrued liability in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets, and corresponding reduction of Company-owned restaurant sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, is\nfor the estimated reward redemptions at domestic Company-owned restaurants based upon estimated redemption patterns.\nThe liability related to Papa Rewards is calculated using the estimated redemption value for which the points and\naccumulated rewards are expected to be redeemed. Revenue is recognized when the customer redeems the Papa Dough\nreward and when the points or Papa Dough reward expires.\nFranchise Royalties and Fees\nFranchise royalties, which are based on a percentage of franchise restaurant sales, are recognized as sales occur. Any\nroyalty reductions, including waivers or those offered as part of a new store development incentive or as incentive for\nother behaviors, including acceleration of restaurant remodels or equipment upgrades, are recognized at the same time as\nthe related royalty, as they are not separately distinguishable from the full royalty rate. Our current standard franchise\nagreement requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 5% of sales, and the majority of our existing franchised restaurants\nhave a 5% contractual royalty rate in effect. Incentives offered from time to time, including new store incentives, will\nreduce the contractual royalty rate paid. Franchise royalties are billed on a monthly basis.\nThe majority of initial franchise license fees and area development exclusivity fees are from international locations. Initial\nfranchise license fees are billed at the store opening date. Area development exclusivity fees are billed upon execution of\nthe development agreements which grant the right to develop franchised restaurants in future periods in specific geographic\nareas. Area development exclusivity fees are included in Deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and\nallocated on a pro rata basis to all stores opened under that specific development agreement. The pre-opening services\nprovided to franchisees do not contain separate and distinct performance obligations from the franchise right; thus, the\nfees collected will be amortized on a straight-line basis beginning at the store opening date through the term of the franchise\nagreement, which is typically 10 years. Franchise license renewal fees for both domestic and international locations, which\ngenerally occur every 10 years, are billed before the renewal date. Fees received for future license renewal periods are\nincluded in deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the life of the renewal period.\nThe Company offers various incentive programs for franchisees including royalty incentives, new restaurant opening\nincentives (i.e. development incentives) and other support initiatives. Royalties and franchise fees sales are reduced to\nreflect any royalty incentives earned or granted under these programs that are in the form of discounts.\nCommissary Revenues\nCommissary revenues are comprised of food and supplies sold to franchised restaurants and are recognized as revenue\nupon shipment of the related products to the franchisees. Payments are generally due within 30 days.\nAs noted above, there are various incentive programs available to franchisees related to new restaurant openings including\ndiscounts on initial commissary orders and new store equipment incentives, at substantially no cost to franchisees.\nCommissary revenues are reduced to reflect incentives in the form of direct discounts on initial commissary orders. The\nnew store equipment incentive is also recorded as a reduction of commissary sales over the term of the incentive agreement,\nwhich is generally three to five years.\nOther Revenues\nFranchise Marketing Fund revenues represent a required established percentage of monthly restaurant sales collected by\nPapa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”), which is our national marketing fund, and various other international and\ndomestic marketing funds (“Co-op” or “Co-operative” Funds) where we have determined for purposes of accounting that\nwe have control over the significant activities of the funds. PJMF funds its operations with ongoing financial support and\ncontributions from domestic Papa John’s restaurants, of which approximately 80% are franchised restaurant members.\nContributions are based on a percentage of monthly restaurant sales and are billed monthly. When we are determined to\nbe the principal in these arrangements, advertising fund contributions and expenditures are reported on a gross basis in the\n56\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. Our obligation related to these funds is to develop and conduct advertising\nactivities in a specific country, region, or market, including the placement of electronic and print materials.\nThere are no expiration dates and we do not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift cards. While the Company and\nthe franchisees continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, the likelihood of redemption may be determined to\nbe remote for certain cards due to long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, the Company recognizes breakage\nrevenue for amounts not subject to unclaimed property laws. Based upon our analysis of historical gift card redemption\npatterns, we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote. Breakage revenue is\nrecognized over time in proportion to estimated redemption patterns as Other revenues. Commissions on gift cards sold\nby third parties are recorded as a reduction to Deferred revenue and a reduction to Other revenues based upon estimated\nredemption patterns.\nFees for information services, including software maintenance fees, help desk fees, centralized call center fees, and online\nordering fees are recognized as revenue as such services are provided and are included in Other revenues.\nRevenues for printing, promotional items, and direct mail marketing services are recognized upon shipment of the related\nproducts to franchisees and other customers. Direct mail advertising discounts are also periodically offered by our\nPreferred Marketing Solutions subsidiary. Other revenues are reduced to reflect these advertising discounts.\nRental income, primarily derived from properties leased by the Company and subleased to franchisees in the United\nKingdom, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective operating lease terms.\nAdvertising and Related Costs\nDomestic Company-owned advertising and related costs of $61.7 million, $56.7 million and $54.3 million in 2021, 2020,\nand 2019, respectively, include the costs of domestic Company-owned local restaurant activities such as mail coupons,\ndoor hangers and promotional items and advertising activities administered through PJMF and various local market\ncooperative advertising funds. PJMF is responsible for developing and conducting marketing and advertising for the\ndomestic Papa John’s system. The Co-op Funds are responsible for developing and conducting advertising activities in a\nspecific market, including the placement of electronic and print materials developed by PJMF. During 2020 and 2019, the\nCompany recorded additional amounts of $15.0 million and $27.5 million, respectively, to PJMF, representing incremental\ndiscretionary marketing fund investments in excess of contractual Company-owned restaurant-level contributions as part\nof our temporary financial support package to our franchisees. The marketing fund investments are included in General\nand administrative expenses within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nLeases\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease term for operating leases, whereas\nlease expense follows an accelerated expense recognition for finance leases. A lease term often includes option periods,\navailable at the inception of the lease. Lease expense is comprised of operating and finance lease costs, short-term lease\ncosts, and variable lease costs, which primarily include common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and insurance for the\nCompany’s real estate leases. Lease costs also include variable rent, which is primarily related to the Company’s supply\nchain tractor and trailer leases that are based on a rate per mile.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for equity grants is estimated on the grant date, net of projected forfeitures, and is recognized over\nthe vesting period (graded vesting over three years). Restricted stock is valued based on the market price of the Company’s\nshares on the date of grant. Stock options are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Our specific assumptions\nfor estimating the fair value of options are included in Note 20.\n57\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less at date of purchase. These\ninvestments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\nAccounts Receivable\nSubstantially all accounts receivable is due from franchisees for purchases of food, paper products, point of sale equipment,\nprinting and promotional items, information systems and related services, marketing and royalties. Credit is extended\nbased on an evaluation of the franchisee’s financial condition and collateral is generally not required. An allowance for\ncredit losses is an estimate, even if remote, based upon historical account write-off trends, facts about the current financial\ncondition of the debtor, forecasts of future operating results based upon current trends of select operating metrics and\nmacroeconomic factors. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased.\nNotes Receivable\nThe Company has provided financing to select domestic and international franchisees principally for use in the\nconstruction and development of their restaurants and for the purchase of restaurants from the Company or other\nfranchisees. Most notes receivable bear interest at fixed or floating rates and are generally secured by the assets of each\nrestaurant and the ownership interests in the franchise. The Company has provided long-term financing to certain\nfranchisees with royalty payment plans. We establish an allowance for credit losses for franchisee notes receivables to\nreduce the outstanding notes receivable to their net realizable values based on a review of each franchisee’s economic\nperformance and market conditions after consideration of the fair value of our underlying collateral rights (e.g., underlying\nfranchisee business, property and equipment) and any guarantees. Note balances are charged off against the allowance\nafter recovery efforts have ceased.\nInterest income recorded on franchisee loans was approximately $1.9 million in 2021, $2.1 million in 2020 and $0.8\nmillion in 2019 and is reported in Investment income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInventories\nInventories, which consist of food products, paper goods and supplies, smallwares, and printing and promotional items,\nare stated at the lower of cost, determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets (generally five to ten years for restaurant, commissary and other equipment, twenty to forty years for\nbuildings and improvements, and five years for technology and communication assets). Leasehold improvements are\namortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including the first renewal\nperiod (generally five to ten years).\nDepreciation expense was $43.0 million in 2021, $46.6 million in 2020 and $45.9 million in 2019.\nDeferred Costs\nWe capitalize certain information systems development and related costs that meet established criteria. Amounts\ncapitalized, which are included in property and equipment, are amortized principally over periods not exceeding five years\nupon completion of the related information systems project. Total costs capitalized were approximately $4.1 million in\n2021, $3.3 million in 2020 and $3.5 million in 2019. The unamortized information systems development costs\napproximated $10.5 million as of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020.\n58\nIntangible Assets — Goodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever we identify certain triggering events or circumstances\nthat would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such tests are\ncompleted separately with respect to the goodwill of each of our reporting units, which includes our domestic Company-\nowned restaurants, United Kingdom (“PJUK”), China, and Preferred Marketing Solutions operations. We may perform a\nqualitative assessment or move directly to the quantitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period if we believe\nthat it is more efficient or if impairment indicators exist.\nWe elected to perform a qualitative assessment for all reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a result of our\nqualitative analyses, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater\nthan their carrying amounts. Subsequent to completing our goodwill impairment tests, no indicators of impairment were\nidentified. See Note 11 for additional information.\nDeferred Income Tax Accounts and Tax Reserves\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\ndetermining the provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes\nincome taxes paid, currently payable or receivable and those deferred.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets\nand liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences\nreverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax attribute carryforwards (e.g., net\noperating losses, capital losses, and foreign tax credits). The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized\nin the period in which the new tax rate is enacted. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional\nbasis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to realize.\nTax authorities periodically audit the Company. We record reserves and related interest and penalties for identified\nexposures as income tax expense. We evaluate these issues and adjust for events, such as statute of limitations expirations,\ncourt rulings or audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. See Note 17 for additional\ninformation.\nInsurance Reserves\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability and property\ninsurance coverage provided to our employees are funded by the Company up to certain retention limits which range up\nto $1.0 million.\nLosses are accrued based upon undiscounted estimates of the liability for claims incurred and for events that have occurred\nbut have not been reported using certain third-party actuarial projections and our claims loss experience. The determination\nof the recorded insurance reserves is highly judgmental and complex due to the significant uncertainty in the potential\nvalue of reported claims and the number and potential value of incurred but not reported claims, the application of\nsignificant judgment in making those estimates and the use of various actuarial valuation methods. The estimated insurance\nclaims losses could be significantly affected should the frequency or ultimate cost of claims differ significantly from\nhistorical trends used to estimate the insurance reserves recorded by the Company. The Company records estimated losses\nabove retention within its reserve with a corresponding receivable for expected amounts due from insurance carriers.\nAs of December 26, 2021, our insurance reserve was $88.1 million as compared to $82.0 million as of December 27, 2020\nprimarily related to auto liability and workers’ compensation claims. Our reserves include claim costs above our retention\nthat have a corresponding receivable. Our insurance receivable for claims above retention totaled $48.1 million and $32.2\nmillion as of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately $18.7 million\nand $12.7 million were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, and $29.4 million and $19.5 million were\nrecorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020,\nrespectively.\n59\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. At inception and on an ongoing basis, we assess whether\neach derivative that qualifies for hedge accounting continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows\nof the hedged item. If the derivative meets the hedge criteria as defined by certain accounting standards, depending on the\nnature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of assets,\nliabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) until\nthe hedged item is recognized in earnings. During 2021, our interest rate swaps were de-designated as cash flow hedges\nfollowing the issuance of our 3.875% fixed senior notes. For these de-designated hedges, the portion of gains or losses on\nthe derivative instruments previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into\nearnings as adjustments to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the originally hedged\ntransactions.\nWe recognized income (loss) of $6.8 million ($5.3 million after tax) in 2021, ($7.5) million (($5.8) million after tax) in\n2020, and ($10.8) million (($8.3) million after tax) in 2019 in other comprehensive income (loss) for the net change in the\nfair value of our interest rate swaps. See Note 12 for additional information on our debt and credit arrangements.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nAt December 26, 2021, the Company had four joint ventures consisting of 188 restaurants, which have noncontrolling\ninterests. Consolidated net income is required to be reported separately at amounts attributable to both the Company and\nthe noncontrolling interests. Additionally, disclosures are required to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests\nof the Company and the interests of the noncontrolling owners, including a disclosure on the face of the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations of income attributable to the noncontrolling interest holder.\nThe following summarizes the redemption feature, location and related accounting within the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nfor these four joint venture arrangements:\nLocation within the\nConsolidated Balance\nType of Joint Venture Arrangement Sheets Recorded Value\nJoint ventures with no redemption feature Permanent equity Carrying value\nJoint ventures with option to require the Company to purchase the noncontrolling\ninterest - not currently redeemable or redemption not probable Temporary equity Carrying value\nSee Note 9 for additional information regarding noncontrolling interests.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe local currency is the functional currency for each of our foreign subsidiaries. Revenues and expenses are translated\ninto U.S. dollars using monthly average exchange rates, while assets and liabilities are translated using year-end exchange\nrates and historical rates. The resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss, net of income taxes.\n60\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nReference Rate Reform – Hedging\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial\nReporting.” The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying guidance on contract modifications and\nhedge accounting related to the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative\nreference rates if certain criteria are met. This guidance was effective beginning on March 12, 2020, and the Company\nmay elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2022. The hedge accounting expedients may be\napplied, on an individual hedging relationship basis, to eligible hedge accounting relationships that existed as of the\nbeginning of the effective date of this guidance, and to new eligible hedging relationships entered into after the effective\ndate of this guidance; however, those expedients generally cannot be applied to hedging relationships for periods after\nDecember 31, 2022. The Company adopted certain optional hedge accounting expedients provided by ASU 2020-04\nduring fiscal 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial\nposition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n61\n3. Leases\nThe Company has significant leases that include most domestic Company-owned restaurant and commissary locations.\nOther domestic leases include tractor and trailer leases used by our distribution subsidiary as well as commissary\nequipment. Additionally, the Company leases a significant number of restaurants within the United Kingdom; these\nrestaurants are then subleased to the franchisees. The Company’s leases have terms as follows:\nA verage lease term\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants Five years, plus at least one renewal\nUnited Kingdom franchise-owned restaurants 15 years\nDomestic commissary locations 10 years, plus at least one renewal\nDomestic and international tractors and trailers Five to seven years\nDomestic and international commissary and office equipment Three to five years\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception and recognizes a right-of-use asset\nand a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less but greater than one\nmonth are not recorded on the balance sheet for select asset classes. The lease liability is measured at the present value of\nfuture lease payments as of the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset recognized is based on the lease liability\nadjusted for prepaid and deferred rent and unamortized lease incentives. An operating lease right-of-use asset is amortized\non a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recognized as a single lease cost against the operating lease liability. A\nfinance lease right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis, with interest costs reported separately, over the lesser\nof the useful life of the leased asset or lease term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term and is included in Operating costs or General and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments are\nexpensed as incurred.\nThe Company uses its incremental borrowing rates as the discount rate for its leases, which is equal to the rate of interest\nthe Company would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar\nterms. The lease terms for all the Company’s leases include the contractually obligated period of the leases, plus any\nadditional periods covered by Company options to extend the leases that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.\nCertain leases provide that the lease payments may be increased annually based on the fixed rate terms or adjustable terms\nsuch as the Consumer Price Index. Future base rent escalations that are not contractually quantifiable as of the lease\ncommencement date are not included in our lease liability.\nThe following schedule details the total right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of\nDecember 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020 (in thousands):\nDecember 26, December 27,\nLeases Classification 2021 2020\nAssets\nFinance lease assets, net Finance lease right-of-use assets, net $ 20,907 $ 16,840\nOperating lease assets, net Operating lease right-of-use assets 176,256 148,110\nTotal lease assets $ 197,163 $ 164,950\nLiabilities\nCurrent finance lease liabilities Current finance lease liabilities $ 4,977 $ 3,545\nCurrent operating lease liabilities Current operating lease liabilities 22,543 23,538\nNoncurrent finance lease liabilities Long-term finance lease liabilities 16,580 13,531\nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities Long-term operating lease liabilities 160,672 124,666\nTotal lease liabilities $ 204,772 $ 165,280\n62\nLease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

At\nDecember 26, 2021, we leased and subleased approximately 425 Papa John’s restaurants to franchisees in the United\nKingdom. The initial lease terms on the franchised sites in the United Kingdom are generally 15 years. The Company\nhas the option to negotiate an extension toward the end of the lease term at the landlord’s discretion. Rental income,\nprimarily derived from properties leased and subleased to franchisees in the United Kingdom, is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the respective operating lease terms.\n63\nLease Guarantees\nAs a result of assigning our interest in obligations under property leases as a condition of the refranchising of certain\nrestaurants, we are contingently liable for payment of approximately 70 domestic leases. These leases have varying terms,\nthe latest of which expires in 2036. As of December 26, 2021, the estimated maximum amount of undiscounted payments\nthe Company could be required to make in the event of nonpayment by the primary lessees was $11.5 million. This\ncontingent liability is not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet or future minimum lease obligation. The fair value\nof the guarantee is not material.\nThere were no leases recorded between related parties.\nSupplemental Cash Flow & Other Information\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020 are\nas follows:\nYear Ended\n(in thousands) December 26, 2021 December 27, 2020 December 29, 2019\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from finance leases $ 1,140 $ 606 $ 269\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases 4,566 2,139 781\nOperating cash flows from operating leases (a) 38,530 37,113 40,152\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities 9,486 9,152 10,199\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease\nliabilities (b) 64,420 30,266 20,903\nCash received from sublease income 11,597 10,545 10,139\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years):\nFinance leases 4.51 4.71 4.75\nOperating leases 8.30 7.00 7.00\nWeighted-average discount rate:\nFinance leases 5.08% 5.34% 6.38%\nOperating leases 6.20% 6.65% 6.94%\n(a) Included within the change in Other assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows offset by non-cash\noperating lease right-of-use asset amortization and lease liability accretion.\n(b) Includes right-of-use assets of approximately $21.8 million for the year ended December 26, 2021 associated with the lease\ncommencement of our Atlanta, Georgia corporate office.\n64\n4.

Revenue Recognition\nContract Balances\nOur contract liabilities primarily relate to franchise fees, unredeemed gift card liabilities, and loyalty program obligations,\nwhich we classify as Deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 26, 2021\nand December 27, 2020, the Company recognized $36.3 million and $33.2 million in revenue, respectively, related to\ndeferred revenue.\nThe following table includes a breakout of contract liability balances (in thousands):\nCo ntract Liabilities\nDecember 26, 2021 December 27, 2020 Change\nFranchise fees and unredeemed gift card liabilities $ 20,410 $ 19,890 $ 520\nCustomer loyalty program obligations 15,136 13,364 1,772\nTotal contract liabilities $ 35,546 $ 33,254 $ 2,292\nOur contract assets consist primarily of equipment incentives provided to franchisees. Equipment incentives are related\nto the future value of commissary revenue the Company will receive over the term of the incentive agreement. As of\n65\nDecember 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, the contract assets were approximately $5.8 million and $5.1 million,\nrespectively. For the years ended December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, revenue was reduced approximately $3.0\nmillion and $3.2 million, respectively, for the amortization of contract assets over the applicable contract terms. Contract\nassets are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\nThe following table (in thousands) includes estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to\nperformance obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period.\nP erforma nc e O bligatio ns by Period\nLess than\n1 Year 1-2 Years 2-3 Years 3-4 Years 4-5 Years Thereafter Total\nFranchise fees $ 2,236 $ 1,979 $ 1,758 $ 1,530 $ 1,255 $ 2,343 $ 11,101\nApproximately $2.5 million of area development fees related to unopened stores and international unearned royalties are\nincluded in Deferred revenue. Timing of revenue recognition is dependent upon the timing of store openings and\nfranchisees’ revenues. Gift card liabilities of approximately $6.8 million, included in Deferred revenue, will be recognized\nin Company-owned restaurant revenues when gift cards are redeemed. The Company will recognize redemption fee\nrevenue in Other revenues when cards are redeemed at franchised restaurant locations.\nThe Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining\nperformance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.\n6. Stockholders’ Deficit\nShares Authorized and Outstanding\nThe Company has authorized 5.0 million shares of preferred stock (of which none were issued or outstanding at\nDecember 26, 2021 or December 27, 2020, respectively) and 100.0 million shares of common stock as of December 26,\n2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively. The Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, net of repurchased\ncommon stock, were 35.8 million shares at December 26, 2021 and 32.5 million shares at December 27, 2020.\nOn May 11, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Repurchase Agreement with certain funds affiliated with, or managed\nby, Starboard Value LP (collectively, “Starboard”), pursuant to which (i) the Company repurchased from Starboard 78,387\nshares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Series B Preferred Stock”)\nand (ii) Starboard converted the remaining 171,613 shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it owned into 3,458,360 shares\nof the Company’s common stock pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation of the Series B Preferred Stock.\nOn June 3, 2021, the Company entered into agreements with certain franchisee investors to repurchase 1,000 shares of the\noutstanding Series B Preferred Stock and convert the remaining 1,530 shares of Series B Preferred Stock into 30,769\nshares of common stock. The Company paid Starboard and the franchisee investors aggregate one-time cash payments of\n$188.6 million for the repurchase and conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The excess\nof the cash payment over the carrying value of the respective Series B Preferred Stock redeemed resulted in $109.9 million\nof dividends on redemption of Series B Preferred Stock in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, which reduced net\nincome attributable to common stockholders and also reduced diluted earnings per share by $3.10 for the year ended\nDecember 26, 2021.\nOn August 3, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Elimination (the “Certificate of Elimination”) with the Secretary\nof State of the State of Delaware to eliminate the Series B Preferred Stock. Effective upon filing, the Certificate of\nElimination eliminated from the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation all matters set forth in the\nCertificate of Designation with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock. The shares that were designated to such series\nwere returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company,\nwithout designation as to series. As a result of the repurchase and conversion, there were no shares of Series B Preferred\nStock authorized or outstanding at December 26, 2021 compared to 260,000 and 252,530 shares of Series B Preferred\n66\nStock authorized and outstanding, respectively, at December 27, 2020. The Series B Preferred Stock was classified as\ntemporary equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 27, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes changes to our Series B Preferred Stock (in thousands):\nB alance at December 29, 2019 $ 251,133\nTax deduction on issuance costs 702\nAccretion 66\nBalance at December 27, 2020 $ 251,901\nAccretion 629\nRedemption (252,530)\nBalance at December 26, 2021 $ —\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn October 28, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with an indefinite duration for up to\n$425.0 million of the Company’s common stock. This share repurchase program operated alongside our previous $75.0\nmillion share repurchase authorization, which began on November 4, 2020 and expired on December 26, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase activity for the years ended December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020,\nrespectively (none in 2019):\nMaximum Dollar\nTotal Average Aggregate Value of Shares\nNumber Price Cost of that May Yet Be\n(in thousands, except average price per share) of Shares Paid per Shares Purchased Under the\nYear Ended Purchased Share Purchased Plans or Programs\nDecember 26, 2021 594 $ 121.96 $ 72,499 $ 424,800\nDecember 27, 2020 32 $ 83.90 $ 2,701 $ 72,299\nSubsequent to year-end, we acquired an additional 109,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $13.3 million. Approximately\n$411.5 million remained available under the Company’s share repurchase program as of February 17, 2022.\nThe timing and volume of share repurchases under the Company’s share repurchase programs may be executed at the\ndiscretion of management on an opportunistic basis, subject to market and business conditions, regulatory requirements\nand other factors, or pursuant to trading plans or other arrangements. Repurchases under the programs may be made\nthrough open market, block, and privately negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1 plans, at times and in such\namounts as management deems appropriate. Repurchases under the Company’s share repurchase programs may be\ncommenced or suspended from time to time at the Company’s discretion without prior notice. Funding for the share\nrepurchase programs will be provided through our credit facility, operating cash flow, stock option exercises and cash and\ncash equivalents.\nDividends\nThe Company recorded dividends of approximately $46.0 million for the year ended December 26, 2021 consisting of the\nfollowing:\n $40.4 million paid to common stockholders ($1.15 per share);\n $3.0 million in preferred dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock (3.6% of the investment per annum);\n $1.5 million of common stock deemed dividend distributions in conjunction with the repurchase and conversion\nof the Series B Preferred Stock; and\n $1.1 million in common stock “pass-through” dividends paid to Series B Preferred Stockholders on an as-\nconverted basis ($0.45 per share).\n67\nThe Company paid aggregate common stock dividends of $29.4 million and $28.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAdditionally, the Company paid common stock “pass-through” dividends on an as-converted basis to Series B Preferred\nStockholders of $4.6 million and $4.3 million, and preferred dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock of $9.1 million and\n$5.7 million, in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn January 27, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock,\nrepresenting an approximate $12.7 million aggregate dividend that was paid on February 18, 2022 to common stockholders\nof record as of the close of business on February 7, 2022. The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at\nthe discretion of our Board of Directors.\n68\n7. Earnings (Loss) per Share\nWe compute earnings (loss) per share using the two-class method. The two-class method requires an earnings allocation\nformula that determines earnings (loss) per share for common shareholders and participating security holders according to\ndividends declared and participating rights in undistributed earnings. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock, which were\nrepurchased by the Company or converted into shares of common stock during the second quarter of 2021, and time-based\nrestricted stock awards are participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights and\nparticipate in undistributed earnings with common stock. Under the two-class method, total dividends provided to the\nholders of participating securities and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, are subtracted from net\nincome attributable to the Company in determining net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders. Additionally,\nany accretion to the redemption value for the Series B Preferred Stock or cash payments in excess of their respective\ncarrying values upon redemption was treated as a deemed dividend in the two-class earnings per share calculation.\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share are computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders\nby the weighted-average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share are computed by dividing\nthe net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding consist of basic weighted average common shares outstanding plus\nweighted average awards outstanding under our equity compensation plans, which are dilutive securities.\nThe calculations of basic earnings (loss) per common share and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for the years\nended December 26, 2021, December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019 are as follows (in thousands, except per share\ndata):\n2021 2020 2019\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share\nNet income attributable to the Company $ 120,016 $ 57,932 $ 4,866\nDividends on redemption of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (109,852) — —\nDividends paid to participating securities (6,091) (14,059) (12,499)\nNet income attributable to participating securities — (2,136) —\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 4,073 $ 41,737 $ (7,633)\nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding 35,007 32,421 31,632\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.12 $ 1.29 $ (0.24)\nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 4,073 $ 41,737 $ (7,633)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 35,007 32,421 31,632\nDilutive effect of outstanding equity awards (a) 330 296 —\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding (b) 35,337 32,717 31,632\nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.12 $ 1.28 $ (0.24)\n(a) Shares subject to options to purchase common stock with an exercise price greater than the average market price for\nthe year were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because the effect would have\nbeen antidilutive. The weighted average number of shares subject to antidilutive options was 100 in 2020 (none in\n2021 or 2019, respectively).\n(b) The Company had 252.5 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 27, 2020 and December 29,\n2019, respectively (none as of December 26, 2021). For the fully diluted calculation, the Series B Preferred stock\ndividends were added back to net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders. The Company then applied the\nif-converted method to calculate dilution on the Series B Preferred Stock, which resulted in 5.0 million additional\ncommon shares. This calculation was anti-dilutive for both periods presented and as such was excluded.\nSee Note 20 for additional information regarding our equity awards, including restricted stock.\n69\n8. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\nThe Company determines the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the price that would be received to sell\nthe asset or paid to transfer the liability to a market participant. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on\na recurring basis and are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\nFair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity specific measurement. Considerable judgment is required to\ninterpret market data to estimate fair value; accordingly, the fair values presented do not necessarily indicate what the\nCompany or its debtholders could realize in a current market exchange.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 26, 2021 and\nDecember 27, 2020 are as follows:\nC arrying Fair V alu e Measurem en t s\n(in thousands) Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDecember 26, 2021\nFinancial assets:\nCash surrender value of life insurance policies (a) $ 41,904 $ 41,904 $ — $ —\nFinancial liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps (b) $ 5,536 $ — $ 5,536 $ —\nDecember 27, 2020\nFinancial assets:\nCash surrender value of life insurance policies (a) $ 37,578 $ 37,578 $ — $ —\nFinancial liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps (b) $ 13,452 $ — $ 13,452 $ —\n(a) Represents life insurance policies held in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan.\n(b) The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based on the sum of all future net present value cash flows. The future cash\nflows are derived based on the terms of our interest rate swaps, as well as considering published discount factors, and\nprojected London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”).\nThere were no transfers among levels within the fair value hierarchy during fiscal 2021 or 2020.\nThe fair value of certain assets and liabilities approximates carrying value because of the short-term nature of the accounts,\nincluding cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net of allowances, and accounts payable. The carrying value of\nnotes receivable, net of allowances, also approximates fair value. The Company’s revolving credit facilities and term debt\nunder the Company’s credit agreement approximate carrying value due to their variable market-based interest rate. The\nCompany’s 3.875% senior notes are classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement since the Company estimates the fair\nvalue by using recent trading transactions, and have the following estimated fair values and carrying values (excluding the\nimpact of unamortized debt issuance costs) as of December 26, 2021 (none in 2020):\nDecembe r 26, 2021\nCarrying Fair\n(in thousands) Value Value\n3.875% Senior Notes $ 400,000 $ 396,000\n70\n9. Noncontrolling Interests\nPapa John’s has four joint venture arrangements in which there are noncontrolling interests held by third parties. These\njoint venture arrangements include 188 restaurants at December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020 respectively. Net\nincome attributable to these joint ventures for the years ended December 26, 2021, December 27, 2020 and December 29,\n2019 were as follows (in thousands):\n2021 2020 2019\nPapa John’s International, Inc. $ 8,457 $ 5,654 $ 2,560\nNoncontrolling interests 4,939 2,682 791\nTotal net income $ 13,396 $ 8,336 $ 3,351\nAs of December 26, 2021, the noncontrolling interest holder of two joint ventures have the option to require the Company\nto purchase their interest, though not currently redeemable. Since redemption of the noncontrolling interests is outside of\nthe Company’s control, the noncontrolling interests are presented in the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following summarizes changes in our redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nBalance at December 29, 2019 $ 5,785\nNet income 824\nDistributions (135)\nBalance at December 27, 2020 $ 6,474\nNet income 2,609\nDistributions (3,585)\nBalance at December 26, 2021 $ 5,498\n10. Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses\non Financial Instruments,” (“ASU 2016-13”) as of December 30, 2019 (the first day of fiscal 2020) under the modified\nretrospective transition method. Topic 326 requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred losses for\nfinancial assets held. Financial instruments subject to Topic 326 include trade accounts receivable, notes receivable and\ninterest receivable (classified as Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets) from franchisees. The impact of the\nadoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nEstimates of expected credit losses, even if remote, are based upon historical account write-off trends, facts about the\ncurrent financial condition of the debtor, forecasts of future operating results based upon current trends of select operating\nmetrics, and macroeconomic factors.

The Notes are guaranteed by each of the Company’s existing and future domestic restricted\nsubsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers under the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below) or other certain\nindebtedness. The Notes were offered and sold either to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers”\npursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or to persons outside the\nUnited States under Regulation S of the Securities Act. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in cash in\narrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2022, at a fixed interest rate of 3.875%\nper annum. In connection with the Notes, the Company recorded $7.1 million of debt issuance costs, which are being\namortized into net interest expense over the term of the Notes.\nThe net proceeds from the Notes, together with borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below),\nwere used to repay outstanding revolver and term loan borrowings under the Company’s Previous Credit Agreement (as\ndefined below).\nThe Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after September 15, 2024 at established\nredemption prices ranging from 97 to 194 basis points depending on when the Notes are redeemed. At any time prior to\nSeptember 15, 2024, the Company may also redeem up to 40% of the Notes with net cash proceeds of certain equity\nofferings at a redemption price equal to 103.875% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and\nunpaid interest, excluding the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to September 15, 2024, the Company may\nredeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be\nredeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and an applicable “make-whole” premium. The Notes also contain customary\nredemption provisions related to asset sales and certain change of control transactions.\nThe Indenture governing the Notes contains customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default,\nfailure to comply with covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or the Notes and certain provisions related to\nbankruptcy events. The Indenture also contains customary negative covenants.\nAmended Credit Agreement\nConcurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the\n“Amended Credit Agreement”) replacing the previous credit agreement (“Previous Credit Agreement”). The Amended\nCredit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate available principal amount of\n$600.0 million (the “PJI Revolving Facility”), of which up to $40.0 million is available as swingline loans and up to $80.0\nmillion is available as letters of credit. The PJI Revolving Facility will mature on September 14, 2026. In connection with\nthe Amended Credit Agreement, the Company recorded $2.1 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized\ninto net interest expense over the term of the Amended Credit Agreement. The remaining availability under the PJI\nRevolving Facility was approximately $510.0 million as of December 26, 2021.\n73\nUp to $50.0 million of the PJI Revolving Facility may be advanced in certain agreed foreign currencies, including Euros,\nPounds Sterling, Canadian Dollars, Japanese Yen, and Mexican Pesos. Additionally, the Amended Credit Agreement\nincludes an accordion feature allowing for a future increase of the PJI Revolving Facility and/or incremental term loans in\nan aggregate amount of up to $500.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from one or\nmore new or existing lenders to provide such increased amounts and ongoing compliance with financial covenants.\nLoans under the PJI Revolving Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company’s election, either a\nLIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% or a base rate (generally determined according to the greater of a\nprime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or a LIBOR rate plus 1.00%) plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00%. In\neach case, the actual margin is determined according to a ratio of the Company’s total indebtedness to earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) for the then most recently ended four quarter period (the\n“Leverage Ratio”). An unused commitment fee ranging from 18 to 30 basis points per annum, determined according to\nthe Leverage Ratio, applies to the unutilized commitments under the PJI Revolving Facility. Loans outstanding under the\nPJI Revolving Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs in the\ncase of borrowings for which a LIBOR rate election is in effect. The Amended Credit Agreement also contain provisions\nspecifying alternative interest rate calculations to be used at such time as LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark\nfor establishing the interest rate on floating interest rate borrowings.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, require\ncustomary reporting obligations, and restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and\nliens, the consummation of certain mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and similar transactions, the making of\ninvestments, equity distributions and other restricted payments, and transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Company\nwill be subject to the following financial covenants: (1) a maximum Leverage Ratio of 5.25 to 1.00, subject to the\nCompany’s election to increase the maximum Leverage Ratio by 0.50 to 1.00 in connection with material acquisitions if\nthe Company satisfies certain requirements, and (2) a minimum interest coverage ratio defined as EBITDA plus\nconsolidated rental expense to consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rental expense of 2.00 to 1.00. We were in\ncompliance with these financial covenants at December 26, 2021.\nObligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain direct and indirect material domestic\nsubsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantors”) and are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the capital\nstock and equity interests of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ domestic and first tier material foreign subsidiaries. The\nAmended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default including, among other things, payment defaults, breach\nof covenants, cross acceleration to material indebtedness, bankruptcy-related defaults, judgment defaults, and the\noccurrence of certain change of control events. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the termination of the\nPJI Revolving Facility, acceleration of repayment obligations and the exercise of remedies by the Lenders with respect to\nthe subsidiary guarantors.\nPJMF Revolving Facility\nPJMF has a $20.0 million revolving line of credit (the “PJMF Revolving Facility”) pursuant to a Revolving Loan\nAgreement, dated September 30, 2015 with U.S. Bank National Association, as lender. The PJMF Revolving Facility is\nsecured by substantially all assets of PJMF. The PJMF Revolving Facility matures on September 30, 2022. The borrowings\nunder the PJMF Revolving Facility accrue interest at a variable rate of the one-month LIBOR plus 1.75%. The applicable\ninterest rates on the PJMF Revolving Facility were 2.7% and 4.1% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. There was no\ndebt outstanding under the PJMF Revolving Facility as of December 26, 2021 or December 27, 2020. The PJMF operating\nresults and the related debt outstanding do not impact the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement.\n74\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nAs of December 26, 2021, we have the following interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $350.0\nmillion:\nEffective Dates F loatin g Rate Debt Fixed Rate s\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 55 million 2.33 %\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 35 million 2.36 %\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 35 million 2.34 %\nJanuary 30, 2018 through August 30, 2022 $ 100 million 1.99 %\nJanuary 30, 2018 through August 30, 2022 $ 75 million 1.99 %\nJanuary 30, 2018 through August 30, 2022 $ 50 million 2.00 %\nOur interest rate swaps were de-designated as cash flow hedges during 2021 following the issuance of the Notes.

Strategic Corporate Reorganization for Long-term Growth\nOn September 17, 2020, we announced plans to open an office in Atlanta, Georgia located in Three Ballpark Center at\nThe Battery Atlanta, which opened in October 2021. The space is designed to drive continued menu innovation and\noptimize integration across marketing, communications, customer experience, operations, human resources, diversity,\nequity and inclusion, financial planning and analysis, investor relations and development functions.

We also maintain an office outside of London, United Kingdom, where our international operations\nare managed. Employees whose positions were relocated to the new Atlanta office were either offered an opportunity to\ncontinue with the organization or were offered a severance package. As a result, we incurred one-time corporate\nreorganization costs of approximately $19.1 million through December 26, 2021 which include $10.2 million of employee\nseverance and other employee transition costs, $5.4 million of recruiting and professional fees, $3.4 million of relocation\ncosts, and $1.0 million of other costs, offset by ($0.9) million of stock-based compensation forfeitures on unvested awards.\nWe record severance as a one-time termination benefit and recognize the expense ratably over the employees’ required\nfuture service period.

Equity Compensation\nWe award stock options, time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units from time to time under\nthe Papa John’s International, Inc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. There are approximately 4.3 million shares of common\nstock authorized for issuance and remaining available under the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan as of December 26, 2021,\nwhich includes 5.9 million shares transferred from the Papa John’s International 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan.\nWe recorded stock-based employee compensation expense of $16.9 million in 2021, $16.3 million in 2020 and $15.3\nmillion in 2019. At December 26, 2021, there was $16.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested\nawards, of which the Company expects to recognize $11.0 million in 2022, $5.0 million in 2023 and $0.7 million in 2024.\nStock Options\nOptions exercised, which were issued from authorized shares, included 212,000 shares in 2021, 541,000 shares in 2020\nand 448,000 shares in 2019. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $10.1\nmillion, $13.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively.\n81\nInformation pertaining to option activity during 2021 is as follows (number of options and aggregate intrinsic value\nin thousands):\nWeighted\nAverage\nWeighted Remaining\nNumber Average Contractual Aggregate\nof Exercise Term Intrinsic\nOptions Price (In Years) Value\nOutstanding at December 27, 2020 564 $ 54.82\nExercised (212) 56.41\nCancelled (33) 46.18\nOutstanding at December 26, 2021 319 $ 54.65 5.68 $ 24,870\nExercisable at December 26, 2021 258 $ 57.14 5.33 $ 19,502\nThe following is a summary of the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of options granted in 2019\n(none granted in 2021 or 2020, respectively):\n2019\nAssumptions (weighted average):\nRisk-free interest rate 2.5 %\nExpected dividend yield 2.1 %\nExpected volatility 31.2 %\nExpected term (in years) 5.7\nThe risk-free interest rate for the periods within the contractual life of an option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve\nin effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield was estimated as the annual dividend divided by the market\nprice of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. Expected volatility was estimated using the Company’s historical share\nprice volatility for a period similar to the expected life of the option.\nOption awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant.\nOptions granted generally vest in equal installments over three years and expire ten years after grant. The expected term\nfor these options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and was calculated using\nhistorical experience.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair values of options granted during 2019 was $11.69. The Company granted options to\npurchase 353,000 shares in 2019. There were no options granted in 2021 or 2020, respectively.\nRestricted Stock\nWe granted shares of restricted stock that are time-based and generally vest in equal installments over three years (130,000\nin 2021, 207,000 in 2020 and 212,000 in 2019). Upon vesting, the shares are issued from treasury stock. These restricted\nshares are intended to focus participants on our long-range objectives, while at the same time serving as a retention\nmechanism. We consider time-based restricted stock awards to be participating securities because holders of such shares\nhave non-forfeitable dividend rights. We declared dividends totaling $410,000 ($1.15 per share) in 2021, $366,000 ($0.90\nper share) in 2020 and $310,000 ($0.90 per share) in 2019 to holders of time-based restricted stock.\nWe granted 11,000, 15,000 and 113,000 restricted stock units that are time-based and vest over a period of one to three\nyears in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Upon vesting, the units are issued from treasury stock. Total dividends\ndeclared for these awards were insignificant to the results of our operations.\nAdditionally, we granted stock settled performance-based restricted stock units to executive management (61,000 units in\n2021, 92,000 units in 2020, and 89,000 units in 2019).\n82\nThe 2021 and 2020 performance-based restricted stock units require the achievement of certain performance and market\nfactors, which consist of the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to a predetermined peer group. The\ngrant-date fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units was determined through the use of a Monte Carlo\nsimulation model.\nThe following is a summary of the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the performance-based\nrestricted stock units granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n2021 2020 2019\nAssumptions:\nRisk-free interest rate 0.2 % 0.9 % 2.5 %\nExpected volatility 48.3 % 36.3 % 33.9 %\nThe risk-free interest rate for the periods within the contractual life of the performance-based restricted stock unit is based\non the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility was estimated using the Company’s\nhistorical share price volatility for a period similar to the expected life of the performance-based restricted stock unit.\nThe performance-based restricted stock units granted vest over three years (cliff vest) and are expensed over the\nperformance period. The weighted average grant-date fair value of performance-based restricted stock units granted during\n2021, 2020 and 2019 was $103.14, $59.52 and $44.95, respectively.\nThe fair value of time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units is based on the market price of\nthe Company’s shares on the grant date. Information pertaining to these awards during 2021 is as follows (shares\nin thousands):\nW eighted\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nShares Fair Value\nTotal as of December 27, 2020 667 $ 54.33\nGranted 203 98.05\nForfeited (57) 60.90\nVested (231) 56.41\nTotal as of December 26, 2021 582 $ 68.06\n21. Employee Benefit Plans\nWe have established the Papa John’s International, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), as a defined contribution benefit\nplan, in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 401(k) Plan is open to employees who meet\ncertain eligibility requirements and allows participating employees to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and\ncontribute such amount to one or more investment funds. At our discretion, we may make matching contribution payments,\nwhich are subject to vesting based on an employee’s length of service with us.\nIn addition, we maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan available to certain employees and directors. Under\nthis plan, the participants may defer a certain amount of their compensation, which is credited to the participants’ accounts.\nThe participant-directed investments associated with this plan are included in Other assets ($41.9 million and $37.6 million\nat December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively) and the associated liabilities ($36.2 million and $35.8 million\nat December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively) are included in Other long-term liabilities in the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAt our discretion, we contributed a matching payment of 4.0% in 2021, 2.1% in 2020 and 2.1% in 2019, up to a maximum\nof 6% of a participating employee’s earnings deferred into both the 401(k) Plan and the non-qualified deferred\ncompensation plan. Such costs were $3.5 million in 2021, $1.8 million in 2020 and $1.5 million in 2019.\n83\n22. Segment Information\nWe have four reportable segments: domestic Company-owned restaurants, North America franchising, North America\ncommissaries, and international operations. The domestic Company-owned restaurant segment consists of the operations\nof all domestic (“domestic” is defined as contiguous United States) Company-owned restaurants and derives its revenues\nprincipally from retail sales of pizza, Papadias, which are flatbread-style sandwiches, and side items, including breadsticks,\ncheesesticks, chicken poppers and wings, dessert items and canned or bottled beverages. The North America commissary\nsegment consists of the operations of our regional dough production and product distribution centers and derives its\nrevenues principally from the sale and distribution of food and paper products to domestic Company-owned and franchised\nrestaurants in the United States and Canada. The North America franchising segment consists of our franchise sales and\nsupport activities and derives its revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and collection of royalties from\nour franchisees located in the United States and Canada. The international segment principally consists of distribution\nsales to franchised Papa John’s restaurants located in the United Kingdom and our franchise sales and support activities,\nwhich derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our international\nfranchisees. International franchisees are defined as all franchise operations outside of the United States and Canada. All\nother business units that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments, which are not\noperating segments, we refer to as “all other,” which consists of operations that derive revenues from the sale, principally\nto Company-owned and franchised restaurants, of printing and promotional items, franchise contributions to marketing\nfunds and information systems and related services used in restaurant operations, including our point-of-sale system, online\nand other technology-based ordering platforms.\nGenerally, we evaluate performance and allocate resources based on operating income and intercompany eliminations.\nCertain administrative and capital costs are allocated to segments based upon predetermined rates or estimated resource\nusage. We account for intercompany sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties and eliminate the\nactivity in consolidation.\nOur reportable segments are business units that provide different products or services. Separate management of each\nsegment is required because each business unit is subject to different operational issues and strategies. No single external\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues.\n84\nOur segment information is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nRevenues:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants $ 778,323 $ 700,757 $ 652,053\nNorth America franchising 129,310 96,732 71,828\nNorth America commissaries 761,305 680,793 612,652\nInternational 184,099 150,939 126,077\nAll others 215,384 184,013 156,638\nTotal revenues $ 2,068,421 $ 1,813,234 $ 1,619,248\nIntersegment revenues:\nNorth America franchising $ 4,179 $ 3,229 $ 2,782\nNorth America commissaries 215,393 192,332 187,073\nInternational - - 191\nAll others 75,366 83,635 88,286\nTotal intersegment revenues $ 294,938 $ 279,196 $ 278,332\nDepreciation and amortization:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants $ 11,728 $ 11,905 $ 12,883\nNorth America commissaries 11,974 9,660 8,131\nInternational 2,326 1,975 1,722\nAll others 9,928 10,254 10,738\nUnallocated corporate expenses 12,860 15,911 13,807\nTotal depreciation and amortization $ 48,816 $ 49,705 $ 47,281\nOperating income:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants (1) $ 49,628 $ 37,049 $ 33,957\nNorth America franchising 120,949 89,801 64,362\nNorth America commissaries 39,873 33,185 30,690\nInternational 34,896 24,034 18,738\nAll others 17,704 7,043 (1,966)\nUnallocated corporate expenses (94,114) (100,069) (120,280)\nElimination of intersegment (profits) (695) (790) (966)\nTotal operating income $ 168,241 $ 90,253 $ 24,535\n(1) Includes $4.7 million of refranchising gains in 2019.\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nProperty and equipment, net:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants $ 241,050 $ 228,077 $ 221,420\nNorth America commissaries 149,218 145,282 142,946\nInternational 14,642 13,604 16,031\nAll others 109,052 91,724 84,167\nUnallocated corporate assets 236,132 213,828 211,842\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (526,238) (491,620) (464,665)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 223,856 $ 200,895 $ 211,741\nExpenditures for property and equipment:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants $ 16,108 $ 12,848 $ 8,811\nNorth America commissaries 4,007 4,447 3,773\nInternational 1,979 1,065 1,143\nAll others 18,645 11,700 11,541\nUnallocated corporate 27,820 5,592 12,443\nTotal expenditures for property and equipment (1) $ 68,559 $ 35,652 $ 37,711\n(1) Increase of $32.9 million in expenditures for property and equipment in 2021 primarily driven by investment in\ngrowth, including technology and development initiatives.\n85\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nIn the following tables, revenues are disaggregated by major product line.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),\nof the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the\nExchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are effective.\n(b) Management’s Report on our Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such\nterm is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide\nreasonable assurance to our management and the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of\npublished financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.\nTherefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial\nstatement preparation and presentation.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal\nControl — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway\nCommission (“2013 Framework”). Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 Framework, our management\nconcluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 26, 2021.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the 2021 Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of its audit, has issued an attestation report, included\nherein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 26, 2021 that\nhave materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n87\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Papa John’s International, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Papa John’s International, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 26, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Papa\nJohn’s International, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 26, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company, and our report dated February 24, 2022\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “Management’s\nReport on our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained\nin all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed\nrisk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nand that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nLouisville, Kentucky\nFebruary 24, 2022\n88\nItem 9B.

Business\nGeneral\nPapa John’s International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as the “Company”, “Papa John’s” or in the first person\nnotations of “we”, “us” and “our”), operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants and, in certain\ninternational markets, dine-in and delivery restaurants under the trademark “Papa John’s”. Papa John’s began operations\nin 1984. At December 27, 2020, there were 5,400 Papa John’s restaurants in operation, consisting of 588 Company-owned\nand 4,812 franchised restaurants operating in 48 countries and territories. Our Company-owned restaurants include 188\nrestaurants operated under four joint venture arrangements. All of the 2,111 international restaurants are franchised.\nStrategy\nWe are committed to delivering on our brand promise “BETTER INGREDIENTS. BETTER PIZZA.®” and a business\nstrategy designed to drive sustainable long-term, profitable growth.\nWe believe that using high quality ingredients leads to superior quality pizzas. Our original crust pizza dough is made\nfrom six simple ingredients and is fresh, never frozen. We also top our pizzas with real cheese made from mozzarella,\npizza sauce made with vine-ripened tomatoes, and meat free of fillers. Our marketing and menu strategies emphasize the\nquality of our ingredients and our new product innovations to accelerate sales. Our menu innovations in 2020 included\nGarlic Parmesan Crust, toasted handheld “Papadias” flatbread-style sandwiches, and Jalapeno Popper Rolls, followed by\nEpic Stuffed Crust Pizza in the first quarter of 2021. New product innovations are designed to increase sales without adding\ncosts or significant operational complexity to our restaurants.\nWe utilize technology to deliver a better customer experience, improve operational efficiencies and inform our decision-\nmaking. Our loyalty and one-to-one marketing platforms help us retain loyal customers and attract new ones. We also\npartner with three of the four top domestic delivery aggregators to meet customer demand for our products. The novel\ncoronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has accelerated customer demand for our products through alternate delivery\nchannels, and these changes have enabled us to meet customer demand during the pandemic, especially during peak times\nwhen our delivery teams are working at full capacity.\nWe care about the health and safety of our team members and customers. The Company has taken steps to mitigate the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing extra health and safety measures across our business, including No\nContact Delivery and enhanced cleaning and sanitization measures. We offered virtual doctor’s visits for team members\nand paid special bonuses to many of our front-line employees in addition to existing benefits such as no-cost mental health\nsupport and affordable health plan options.\nWe continue to expand our footprint, both domestically and internationally. Our growth is dependent on maintaining a\nstrong franchise system and improving unit economics. We seek to attract and retain franchisees with experience in\nrestaurant or retail operations and with the financial resources and management capability to open single or multiple\nlocations. While each Papa John’s franchisee manages and operates its own restaurants and business, we devote significant\nresources to providing franchisees with assistance in restaurant operations, quality assurance, technology, training,\nmarketing, site selection and restaurant design. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to open\nstores, both domestically and internationally, but we have expended additional resources to drive our development efforts\nwhen the pandemic subsides. We expect overall unit growth to come increasingly from international markets.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit, motivate and retain a highly qualified workforce in an intensely competitive\nenvironment. We believe that increasing diversity in our workforce will also help us drive innovation that reflects and\nresonates with the increasing diversity of our customers domestically and globally.\n3\nTable of Contents\nSegment Overview\nPapa John’s has defined four reportable segments: Domestic Company-owned restaurants, North America commissaries\n(Quality Control Centers), North America franchising and International operations.\nDomestic Company-owned Restaurants\nThe Domestic Company-owned restaurant segment consists of the operations of all domestic Company-owned restaurants\n(“domestic” is defined as the contiguous United States) and derives its revenues principally from retail sales of pizza,\n“Papadias”, which are flatbread-style sandwiches, and side items, including breadsticks, cheesesticks, chicken poppers\nand wings, dessert items and canned or bottled beverages.\nOf the total 3,289 North American restaurants open as of December 27, 2020, 588 units, or approximately 18%, were\nCompany-owned. In 2020, the 579 domestic Company-owned restaurants included in the full year’s comparable restaurant\nbase generated average annual unit sales of $1.2 million. We are committed to maintaining sound restaurant unit\neconomics.\nOperating Company-owned restaurants allows us to improve operations, training, marketing and quality standards for the\nbenefit of the entire system.\nNorth America commissary\nThe North America commissary segment comprises 11 full-service regional dough production and distribution Quality\nControl Centers (“QC Centers”) in the United States (“U.S.”), which supply pizza sauce, dough, food products, paper\nproducts, smallwares and cleaning supplies twice weekly to each traditional restaurant served. This system enables us to\nmonitor and control product quality and consistency while lowering food and other costs. We also have one QC Center in\nCanada, which produces and distributes fresh dough. We evaluate the QC Center system capacity in relation to existing\nrestaurants’ volumes and planned restaurant growth, and facilities are developed or upgraded as operational or economic\nconditions warrant. To ensure consistent food quality, each domestic franchisee is required to purchase dough and pizza\nsauce from our QC Centers and to purchase all other supplies from our QC Centers or other approved suppliers.\nNorth America franchising\nThe North America franchising segment consists of our franchise sales and support activities and derives its revenues from\nthe sale of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our franchisees located in the United\nStates and Canada. Our North American franchised restaurants, which included 2,377 restaurants in the full year’s\ncomparable base for 2020, generated average annual unit sales of $1.0 million. These sales, while not included in the\nCompany’s revenues, contribute to our royalty revenues, franchisee marketing fund contributions, and commissary\nrevenue.\nInternational\nThe International segment principally consists of distribution sales to franchised Papa John’s restaurants located in the\nUnited Kingdom (“UK”) and our franchise sales and support activities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and\ndevelopment rights and the collection of royalties from our international franchisees. International franchisees are defined\nas all franchise operations outside of the United States and Canada. As of December 27, 2020, there were 2,111\ninternational restaurants, all of which are franchised. The Company currently operates one international QC Center, which\nis in the UK. Other QC Centers outside the U.S. are operated by franchisees pursuant to license agreements or by other\nthird parties.\nAll others\nAll other business units that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments, which are not\noperating segments, we refer to as “all others,” which consists of operations that derive revenues from the sale, principally\n4\nTable of Contents\nto Company-owned and franchised restaurants, of printing and promotional items, franchise contributions to marketing\nfunds and information systems and related services used in restaurant operations, including our point-of-sale system, online\nand other technology-based ordering platforms.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 23” of “Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements” for financial information about our segments.\nDevelopment\nAt December 27, 2020, there were 5,400 Papa John’s restaurants operating in 48 countries and territories, as follows:\nDomestic Franchised Total\nCompany- North North\nowned America America International System-wide\nBeginning - December 29, 2019 598 2,690 3,288 2,107 5,395\nOpened 2 62 64 156 220\nClosed (12) (51) (63) (152) (215)\nEnding - December 27, 2020 588 2,701 3,289 2,111 5,400\nNet unit growth (decline) - 2020 (10) 11 1 4 5\nAlthough most of our domestic Company-owned markets are well-penetrated, our Company-owned restaurant growth\nstrategy is to continue to open domestic restaurants in existing markets as appropriate, thereby increasing consumer\nawareness and enabling us to take advantage of operational and marketing scale efficiencies. Our experience in developing\nmarkets indicates that market penetration through the opening of multiple restaurants in a particular market results in\nincreased average restaurant sales in that market over time. We have co-developed domestic markets with some franchisees\nor divided markets among franchisees and will continue to use market co-development in the future, where appropriate.\nAs of December 27, 2020, we have development agreements with our franchisees for approximately 210 additional North\nAmerica restaurants, the majority of which are committed to open over the next two years, and 1,250 additional\ninternational franchised restaurants, the majority of which are scheduled to open over the next six years.\nFranchise Program\nWe continue to attract qualified and experienced franchisees, whom we consider to be a vital part of our system’s continued\ngrowth. We believe our relationship with our franchisees is fundamental to the performance of our brand and we strive to\nmaintain a collaborative relationship with our franchisees. Franchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant’s\nbusiness background, restaurant operating experience and financial resources.\nNorth America Development and Franchise Agreements. We enter into development agreements with our franchisees in\nNorth America for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified\ngeographic area. The franchise agreement is generally executed once a franchisee secures a location. Our current standard\nfranchise agreement requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 5% of sales, and the majority of our existing franchised\nrestaurants have a 5% contractual royalty rate in effect. Incentives offered from time to time, including new store\nincentives, will reduce the contractual royalty rate paid. We provided financial assistance for traditional North America\nfranchisees in 2018, 2019 and 2020 in the form of lower royalties, royalty-based service incentives, targeted relief as well\nas additional contributions to Papa John’s Marketing Fund (“PJMF”).\nOver the past several years, we have offered various development incentive programs for domestic franchisees to\naccelerate unit openings. Such incentives included the following for 2020 traditional openings: (1) waiver of all or part of\nthe standard one-time franchise fee; (2) waiver of all or part of the 5% royalty fee for a period of time; (3) credit for new\nstore equipment; and (4) credit to be applied toward a future food purchase, under certain circumstances. We believe\ndevelopment incentive programs have accelerated unit openings, and we expect to continue to utilize such development\nincentives.\n5\nTable of Contents\nSubstantially all existing franchise agreements have an initial 10-year term with a 10-year renewal option. We have the\nright to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons, including a franchisee’s failure to make payments when\ndue or failure to adhere to our operational policies and standards. Many state franchise laws limit our ability as a franchisor\nto terminate or refuse to renew a franchise.\nInternational Development and Franchise Agreements. In international markets, we have either a development agreement\nor a master franchise agreement with a franchisee for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined\nperiod of time and specified geographic area. Under a master franchise agreement, the franchisee has the right to sub-\nfranchise a portion of the development to one or more sub-franchisees approved by us.\nOur current standard international master franchise and development agreements provide for payment to us of a royalty\nfee of 5% of sales. For international markets with sub-franchise agreements, the effective sub-franchise royalty received\nby the Company is generally 3% of sales and the master franchisee generally receives a royalty of 2% of sales. The\nremaining terms applicable to the operation of individual restaurants are substantially equivalent to the terms of our\ndomestic franchise agreement. Development agreements will be negotiated at other-than-standard terms for fees and\nroyalties, and we may offer various development and royalty incentives to help drive net unit growth and results.\nFranchise Operations. All franchisees are required to operate their Papa John’s restaurants in compliance with our policies,\nstandards and specifications, including matters such as menu items, ingredients, and restaurant design. Franchisees have\nfull discretion in human resource practices, and generally have full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to\ncustomers, but we generally have the authority to set maximum price points for nationally advertised promotions.\nFranchisee Loans. Selected domestic and international franchisees have borrowed funds from us, principally for the\npurchase of restaurants from us or other franchisees or, in certain international markets, for construction and development\nof new restaurants. Loans made to franchisees can bear interest at fixed or floating rates and in most cases are secured by\nthe fixtures, equipment and signage of the restaurant and/or are guaranteed by the franchise owners. At December 27,\n2020, net loans outstanding totaled $47.9 million. See “Note 2” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for\nadditional information.\nMarketing Programs\nOur domestic marketing strategy consists of both national and local components. Our national strategy includes national\nadvertising via television, print, direct mail, digital, mobile marketing and social media channels. Our digital marketing\nactivities have increased significantly over the past several years in response to increasing customer use of online and\nmobile technology. Local advertising programs include television, radio, print, direct mail, store-to-door flyers, digital,\nmobile marketing and local social media channels.\nDomestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s restaurants within a defined market may be required to join an area\nadvertising cooperative (“Co-op”). Each member restaurant contributes a percentage of sales to the Co-op for market-wide\nprograms, such as television, radio, digital and print advertising, and sports sponsorships. The rate of contribution and uses\nof the monies collected are determined by a majority vote of the Co-op’s members.\nThe restaurant-level and Co-op marketing efforts are supported by media, print, digital and electronic advertising materials\nthat are produced by PJMF, our national marketing fund. PJMF is a consolidated nonstock corporation, designed to operate\nat break-even for the purpose of designing and administering advertising and promotional programs for all participating\ndomestic restaurants. PJMF produces and buys air time for Papa John’s national television commercials and advertises the\nCompany’s products through digital media including banner advertising, paid search-engine advertising, mobile\nmarketing, social media advertising and marketing, text messaging, and email. PJMF also engages in other brand-building\nactivities, such as consumer research and public relations activities. Domestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s\nrestaurants are required to contribute a certain minimum percentage of sales to PJMF.\nIn international markets, our marketing focuses on reaching customers who live or work within a small radius of a Papa\nJohn’s restaurant. Our international markets use a combination of advertising strategies, including television, radio, print,\ndigital, mobile marketing and local social media depending on the size of the local market.\n6\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital\nOur team members are critical to our success. As of December 27, 2020, we employed approximately 16,700 persons, of\nwhom approximately 14,200 were team members at Company-owned restaurants, approximately 700 were management\npersonnel at Company-owned restaurants, approximately 700 were corporate personnel and approximately 1,100 were QC\nCenter and our print and promotions subsidiary personnel. Most restaurant team members work part-time and are paid on\nan hourly basis.\nOur franchisees are independent business owners, so their employees are not our employees and therefore are not included\nin our employee count. We estimate the total number of persons in Papa John’s system, including our team members,\nfranchisees and the team members of franchisees, was approximately 130,000 as of December 27, 2020.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nOur commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is rooted in our belief that having a Papa John's family that fully reflects\nand celebrates the global nature of our brand is the right way to do business.\nWe are building a culture of leaders who believe in inclusivity, diversity and winning. We’re implementing initiatives to\ndiversify our workforce and leadership pipeline, embed policies and practices that ensure fairness and instill and reward\nbehaviors across the organization that foster belonging and increase employee engagement. Out of the 11 members of our\nExecutive Leadership Team, four are female, one is Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer or Questioning (“LGBTQ”)\nand two are Black. We have also initiated multiple corporate initiatives over the past several years. Some examples are\nour affordable healthcare plans and free virtual healthcare visits available to all part-time and full-time team members; the\nlaunch of The Papa John’s Foundation for Building Community; our inaugural Day of Service with Boys and Girls Clubs\nof America; and the creation of eight employee resource affinity groups.\nTalent Attraction, Retention and Development\nTo help our team members succeed in their roles and to ensure consistent operational execution, we emphasize continuous\ntraining and development opportunities, including providing innovative tools and materials for the operational training\nand development of team members. Operations personnel complete our management training program and ongoing\ndevelopment programs, including multi-unit training, in which instruction is given on all aspects of our systems and\noperations. In addition, to further support our team members’ development, we have established our Dough & Degrees\nprogram, which allows our team members to earn a college degree for free or at a reduced tuition in partnership with\nPurdue University Global and the University of Maryland Global Campus. We also offer a tuition reimbursement program\nthat provides another opportunity for our team members to advance their careers. We also previously announced the\nplanned 2021 opening of an office in Atlanta, Georgia to tap into the diverse, deep talent pool in the region.\nWorkplace Health and Safety\nAs part of the Company’s enterprise-wide safety management system, we invest in training, technology and people\nto protect both our customers and team members. All Papa John’s team members, from those at our corporate office to\nthose working in our warehouses and restaurants, receive annual safety training based on the requirements of their\nroles. Both QC Centers and restaurant operations undergo annual safety audits, as well as random safety checks by\nregional safety managers and field safety coordinators.\nWe have also taken steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our team members and our customers by\nimplementing extra health and safety measures across our business, including No Contact Delivery and enhanced cleaning\nand sanitization measures.\n7\nTable of Contents\nIndustry and Competition\nThe United States Quick Service Restaurant pizza (“QSR Pizza”) industry is mature and highly competitive with respect\nto price, service, location, food quality, customer loyalty programs and product innovation. The QSR Pizza category is\nlargely fragmented and competitors include international, national and regional chains, as well as a large number of local\nindependent pizza operators, any of which can utilize a growing number of food delivery services. Some of our\ncompetitors have been in existence for substantially longer periods than Papa John’s, have substantially greater resources\nthan Papa John’s and can have higher levels of restaurant penetration and stronger, more developed brand awareness in\nmarkets where we compete. Competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery concepts continues to increase\nboth domestically and internationally.\nWith respect to the sale of franchises, we compete with many franchisors of restaurants and other business concepts. There\nis also active competition for management personnel, drivers and hourly team members, and attractive commercial real\nestate sites suitable for Papa John’s restaurants.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe, along with our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting the operation of\nour respective businesses, including laws and regulations related to our marketing and advertising as well as the preparation\nand sale of food, food safety and menu labeling. Each Papa John’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a\nnumber of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the state\nor municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, required licenses or\napprovals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant in a particular area. Our QC Centers are licensed and\nsubject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and the operation of our trucks is subject to federal and state\ntransportation regulations. We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations. In addition, our domestic\noperations are subject to various federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, benefits,\ntaxation, working conditions, citizenship requirements, and overtime.\nWe are subject to Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of\nfranchises. The laws of several states also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC\nrequires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information. State\nlaws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a significant number of states, and bills have\nbeen introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the U.S. franchisor-franchisee\nrelationship in certain respects if such bills were enacted. State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope\nof non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign\ncountries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee\nrelationship. National, state and local government regulations or initiatives, including health care legislation, “living\nwage,” or other current or proposed regulations, and increases in minimum wage rates affect Papa John’s as well as others\nwithin the restaurant industry. We are also subject to applicable laws in each non-U.S. jurisdiction in which we operate.\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nWe are subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally. The legal and regulatory landscape for privacy\nand data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increase in attention given to privacy and data protection\nissues with the potential to impact our business. This includes recently enacted laws and regulations in the U.S. and in\nother countries which require notification to individuals and government authorities of breaches involving certain\ncategories of personal information. Any changes in privacy and data protection laws or regulations could also adversely\nimpact the way we use e-mail, text messages and other marketing techniques and could require changes in our marketing\nstrategies. We have a privacy policy posted on our website at www.papajohns.com. The security of our financial data,\ncustomer information and other personal information is a priority for us.\n8\nTable of Contents\nTrademarks, Copyrights and Domain Names\nWe protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, foreign\nintellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” for a discussion of recent business developments, including the impact the COVID-19\npandemic is having on our business and results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditional Information\nAll of our periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) pursuant to\nSection 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are available, free\nof charge, through our website located at www.papajohns.com.

The references\nto these website addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the websites, which\nshould not be considered part of this document.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to risks that could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThese risks could cause actual operating results to differ from those expressed in certain “forward-looking statements”\ncontained in this Form 10-K as well as in other Company communications. You should carefully consider the following\nrisk factors together with all other information included in this Form 10-K and our other publicly filed documents.\nIndustry Risks\nWe are subject to risks related to pandemic outbreaks, including COVID-19, which may have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has had, and is expected to continue to have,\nsignificant adverse impacts on economic and market conditions. In response to the pandemic, governments and other\nauthorities around the world have imposed measures to attempt to control the spread of COVID-19, including restrictions\non freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans, social distancing requirements, including limitations\non gatherings, shelter-in-place orders and quarantines, and mandated business closures, which have resulted in significant\nchanges in commercial activity and consumer behavior. We cannot predict when the effects of the pandemic will subside,\nhow long there will be continuing resurgences or mutations of the virus or the effectiveness of vaccines and treatment\n9\nTable of Contents\ntherapies or the speed of vaccine distribution. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues or worsens, restrictions\nimposed by governments may not be lifted, or additional restrictions may be imposed. As a result, businesses such as our\nrestaurants or QC Centers may be required to shut down, our employees may be prohibited from working, and our supply\nchains may be interrupted. It may be challenging to obtain and process ingredients and raw materials to support our\nbusiness needs. In addition, individuals have and may continue to become ill, quarantined or otherwise unable to work\nand/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. Also, governments may impose other laws, regulations or\ntaxes which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, if our customers’\neconomic conditions are similarly affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe potential adverse effects of COVID-19 also could include, but may not be limited to, our ability to meet consumer\ndemand through the continued availability of our workforce; adverse impacts from new laws and regulations affecting our\nbusiness; increased cyber risks and reliance on technology infrastructure to support our business and operations, including\nthrough remote-work protocols; fluctuations in foreign currency markets credit risks of our customers and counterparties;\nand impairment of long-lived assets, the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets. However,\ngiven the evolving health, economic, social, and governmental environments, the specific impact that COVID-19 could\nhave on these risks remains uncertain.\nMoreover, during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant increase in comparable sales\nand revenues. The circumstances that have contributed to the acceleration of the growth of our business stemming from\nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue in the future once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic tapers,\nparticularly as a vaccine becomes widely available, and customers are no longer subject to shelter-in-place or social\ndistancing mandates. We expect the growth rates in comparable sales and revenues to slow or decline.\nOur profitability may suffer as a result of intense competition in our industry.\nThe QSR Pizza industry is mature and highly competitive. Competition is based on price, service, location, food quality,\nbrand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, use of technology,\nand the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. We may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to\nrespond to competitive and customer pressures, which may adversely affect our profitability. When commodity and other\ncosts increase, we may be limited in our ability to increase prices. With the significant level of competition and the pace\nof innovation, we may be required to increase investment spending in several areas, particularly marketing and technology,\nwhich can decrease profitability.\nIn addition to competition with our larger competitors, we face competition from new competitors such as fast casual pizza\nconcepts. We also face competitive pressures from an array of food delivery concepts and aggregators delivering for quick\nservice or dine in restaurants, using new delivery technologies or delivering for competitors who previously did not have\ndelivery capabilities, some of which may have more effective marketing. The emergence or growth of new competitors,\nin the pizza category or in the food service industry generally, may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our\nmarket share and could negatively impact our sales and our system-wide restaurant operations. We also face increasing\ncompetition from other home delivery services and grocery stores that offer an increasing variety of prepped or prepared\nmeals in response to consumer demand. As a result, our sales can be directly and negatively impacted by actions of our\ncompetitors, the emergence or growth of new competitors, consumer sentiment or other factors outside our control.\nOne of our competitive strengths is our “BETTER INGREDIENTS. BETTER PIZZA.®” brand promise. This means we\nmay use ingredients that cost more than the ingredients some of our competitors may use. Because of our investment in\nhigher-quality ingredients, we could have lower profit margins than some of our competitors if we are not able to establish\na quality differentiator that resonates with consumers. Our sales may be particularly impacted as competitors increasingly\nemphasize lower-cost menu options.\n10\nTable of Contents\nChanges in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could adversely impact our results.\nChanges in consumer preferences and trends could negatively affect us (for example, changes in consumer perceptions of\ncertain ingredients that could cause consumers to avoid pizza or some of its ingredients in favor of foods that are or are\nperceived as healthier, lower-calorie, or lower in carbohydrates or otherwise based on their ingredients or nutritional\ncontent). Preferences for a dining experience such as fast casual pizza concepts could also adversely affect our restaurant\nbusiness and reduce the effectiveness of our marketing and technology initiatives. Also, our success depends to a\nsignificant extent on numerous factors affecting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer income and spending,\nsuch as general economic conditions, customer sentiment and the level of employment. Any factors that could cause\nconsumers to spend less on food or shift to lower-priced products could reduce sales or inhibit our ability to maintain or\nincrease pricing, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nFood safety and quality concerns may negatively impact our business and profitability.\nIncidents or reports of food- or water-borne illness or other food safety issues, investigations or other actions by food\nsafety regulators, food contamination or tampering, employee hygiene and cleanliness failures, improper franchisee or\nemployee conduct, or presence of communicable disease at our restaurants (both Company-owned and franchised), QC\nCenters, or suppliers could lead to product liability or other claims. If we were to experience any such incidents or reports,\nour brand and reputation could be negatively impacted. This could result in a significant decrease in customer traffic and\ncould negatively impact our revenues and profits. Similar incidents or reports occurring at quick service restaurants\nunrelated to us could likewise create negative publicity, which could negatively impact consumer behavior towards us.\nWe rely on our domestic and international suppliers, as do our franchisees, to provide quality ingredients and to comply\nwith applicable laws and industry standards. A failure of one of our domestic or international suppliers to meet our quality\nstandards, or meet domestic or international food industry standards, could result in a disruption in our supply chain and\nnegatively impact our brand and our results.\nFailure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur results depend upon our ability to differentiate our brand and our reputation for quality. Damage to our brand or\nreputation could negatively impact our business and financial results. Our brand has been highly rated in certain U.S.\nsurveys, and we strive to build the value of our brand as we develop international markets.\nConsumer perceptions of our brand are affected by a variety of factors, such as the nutritional content and preparation of\nour food, the quality of the ingredients we use, our corporate culture, our policies and systems related to diversity, equity\nand inclusion, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. Consumer acceptance\nof our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. Consumer perceptions\nmay also be affected by third parties, including former employees and executives, presenting or promoting adverse\ncommentary or portrayals of our industry, our brand, our suppliers or our franchisees, or otherwise making statements,\ndisclosing information or taking actions that could damage our reputation. If we are unsuccessful in managing incidents\nthat erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation,\nour brand value and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could\nadversely impact our business.\nIn recent years, there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, chat platforms,\nsocial media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience\nof consumers and other persons. The rising popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has\nincreased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. The dissemination of negative information via social\nmedia could harm our business, brand, reputation, marketing partners, financial condition, and results of operations,\nregardless of the information’s accuracy.\n11\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers and the public in general. Failure to use social\nmedia effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue. Other risks associated with the use of social media\ninclude improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our brand, exposure of personally\nidentifiable information, fraud, hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information.\nOur franchise business model presents a number of risks.\nOur success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence\nover their operations. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-\nto-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the\nability of our franchisees to grow their sales. If our franchisees do not experience sales growth, our revenues and margins\ncould be negatively affected. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, especially in emerging markets and/or high cost\nmarkets, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, higher levels of required\nfinancial support from us, higher numbers of restaurant closures, reduced numbers of restaurant openings, delayed or\nreduced payments to us, or increased franchisee assistance, which reduces our revenues.\nOur success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our franchisees to remain aligned with us on\noperating, promotional and marketing plans. Franchisees’ ability to continue to grow is also dependent in large part on the\navailability of franchisee funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in\ngeneral or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees. Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our\nfranchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and\nvalues, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation.\nIf franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, the brand’s image\nand reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\nWe may be adversely impacted by increases in the cost of food ingredients and other costs.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in prices of commodities. An increase in the cost or sustained high levels of the cost of\ncheese or other commodities could adversely affect the profitability of our system-wide restaurant operations, particularly\nif we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to offset increased costs. Cheese, representing our largest food\ncost, and other commodities can be subject to significant cost fluctuations due to weather, availability, global demand and\nother factors that are beyond our control. Additionally, increases in labor, mileage, insurance, fuel, and other costs could\nadversely affect the profitability of our restaurant and QC Center businesses. Many of the factors affecting costs in our\nsystem-wide restaurant operations are beyond our control, and we may not be able to adequately mitigate these costs or\npass along these costs to our customers or franchisees, given the significant competitive pricing pressures we face.\nChanges in privacy or data protection laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email, text messages and postal mailings. Any future\nrestrictions in federal, state or foreign laws regarding marketing and solicitation or domestic or international data protection\nlaws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email, text messages and postal\nmailing techniques and could force changes in our marketing strategies. If this occurs, we may need to develop alternative\nmarketing strategies, which may not be as effective and could impact the amount and timing of our revenues.\nOur international operations are subject to increased risks and other factors that may make it more difficult to achieve or\nmaintain profitability or meet planned growth rates.\nOur international operations could be negatively impacted by volatility and instability in international economic, political,\nsecurity or health conditions in the countries in which the Company or our franchisees operate, especially in emerging\nmarkets. In addition, there are risks associated with differing business and social cultures and consumer preferences. We\nmay face limited availability for restaurant locations, higher location costs and difficulties in franchisee selection and\nfinancing. We may be subject to difficulties in sourcing and importing high-quality ingredients (and ensuring food safety)\nin a cost-effective manner, hiring and retaining qualified team members, marketing effectively and adequately investing\nin information technology, especially in emerging markets.\n12\nTable of Contents\nOur international operations are also subject to additional risk factors, including import and export controls, compliance\nwith anti-corruption and other foreign laws, difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contract rights in foreign\njurisdictions, and the imposition of increased or new tariffs or trade barriers. We intend to continue to expand\ninternationally, which would make the risks related to our international operations more significant over time.\nOur international restaurants’ results, which are completely franchised, depend heavily on the operating capabilities and\nfinancial strength of our franchisees. Any changes in the ability of our franchisees to run their stores profitably in\naccordance with our operating standards, or to effectively sub-franchise restaurants, could result in brand damage, a higher\nnumber of restaurant closures and a reduction in the number of new restaurant openings.\nSales made by our franchisees in international markets and certain loans we provide to such franchisees are denominated\nin their local currencies, and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar occur relative to the local currencies. Accordingly, changes in\ncurrency exchange rates will cause our revenues, investment income and operating results to fluctuate. We have not\nhistorically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Our international revenues and earnings may be\nadversely impacted as the U.S. dollar rises against foreign currencies because the local currency will translate into fewer\nU.S. dollars. Additionally, the value of certain assets or loans denominated in local currencies may deteriorate. Other\nitems denominated in U.S. dollars, including product imports or loans, may also become more expensive, putting pressure\non franchisees’ cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union\n(referred to as “Brexit”), including implications for the free flow of labor and goods in the United Kingdom and the\nEuropean Union and other financial, legal, tax and trade implications.\nAdverse global economic conditions subject us to additional risk.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which\nneither we nor our franchisees have control. An economic downturn, including deterioration in the economic conditions\nin the U.S. or international markets where we compete, may result in a reduction in the demand for our products, longer\npayment cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.\nPoor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could\nalso disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.\nHigher labor costs and increased competition for qualified team members increase the cost of doing business and ensuring\nadequate staffing in our restaurants and QC Centers. Additionally, changes in employment and labor laws, including\nhealth care legislation and minimum wage increases, could increase costs for our system-wide operations.\nOur success depends in part on our and our franchisees’ ability to recruit, motivate, train and retain a qualified workforce\nto work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating\nand retaining qualified employees to work in Company-owned and franchised restaurants have had, and may in the future\nhave, a negative impact on our Company-owned restaurant margins and the margins of franchised restaurants.\nCompetition for qualified drivers for both our restaurants and supply-chain function also continues to increase as more\ncompanies compete for drivers or enter the delivery space, including third party aggregators. Additionally, economic\nactions, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us\n(including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers. Social media may be used to foster\nnegative perceptions of employment with our Company in particular or in our industry generally, and to promote strikes\nor boycotts.\nWe are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime\ncompensation, benefits, working conditions, citizenship requirements and discrimination and family and medical leave\nand employee related litigation. Labor costs and labor-related benefits are primary components in the cost of operation of\nour restaurants and QC Centers. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could increase\nour system-wide labor costs.\n13\nTable of Contents\nA significant number of hourly personnel are paid at rates close to the federal and state minimum wage requirements.\nAccordingly, the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases above federal wage rates or regulations\nrelated to exempt employees has increased and could continue to increase labor costs for our domestic system-wide\noperations. A significant increase in the federal minimum wage requirement could adversely impact our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to invest\nin or adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including digital ordering solutions, through which over half of our domestic\nsales originate. We also rely heavily on point-of-sale processing in our Company-owned and franchised restaurants for\ndata collection and payment systems for the collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions, and other processes and\nprocedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends on the reliability and capacity of these\ntechnology systems. In addition, we anticipate that consumers will continue to have more options to place orders digitally,\nboth domestically and internationally. We plan to continue to invest in enhancing and improving the functionality and\nfeatures of our information technology systems. However, we cannot ensure that our initiatives will be beneficial to the\nextent, or within the timeframes, expected or that the estimated improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. Our\nfailure to adequately invest in new technology, adapt to technological developments and industry trends, particularly our\ndigital ordering capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share. Notwithstanding adequate\ninvestment in new technology, our marketing and technology initiatives may not be successful in improving our\ncomparable sales results. Additionally, we are in an environment where the technology life cycle is short and consumer\ntechnology demands are high, which requires continued reinvestment in technology that will increase the cost of doing\nbusiness and will increase the risk that our technology may not be customer-centric or could become obsolete, inefficient\nor otherwise incompatible with other systems.\nWe rely on our international franchisees to maintain their own point-of-sale and online ordering systems, which are often\npurchased from third-party vendors, potentially exposing international franchisees to more operational risk, including\ncyber and data privacy risks and governmental regulation compliance risks.\nCompany Risks\nOur reorganization activities will increase our expenses, may not be successful, and may adversely impact employee hiring\nand retention.\nOn September 17, 2020, we announced plans to open an office in Atlanta, Georgia. As a result, we have incurred and will\nincur certain non-recurring corporate reorganization costs in 2020 and 2021, and these expenses have impacted and will\nadversely impact our results of operations during the relevant periods and will reduce our cash position. Additionally, the\namount of these estimated expenses, as well as our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our corporate\nreorganization, are subject to assumptions and uncertainties. If we do not realize the anticipated benefits from these\nmeasures, or if we incur costs greater than anticipated, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely\naffected.\nIn addition, turnover in our corporate office support teams due to certain functions relocating to our office in Georgia could\ndistract our employees, decrease employee morale, harm our reputation, and negatively impact the overall performance of\nour corporate support teams. As a result of these or other similar risks, our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to effectively market our products or maintain key marketing partnerships.\nThe success of our business depends on the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional plans. We may not be able to\neffectively execute our national or local marketing plans, particularly if we experienced lower sales that would result in\nreduced levels of marketing funds. We may be required to expend additional funds to effectively improve consumer\nsentiment and sales, and we may also be required to engage in additional activities to retain customers or attract new\n14\nTable of Contents\ncustomers to the brand. Such marketing expenses and promotional activities, which could include discounting our\nproducts, could adversely impact our results.\nPersons or marketing partners who endorse our products could take actions that harm their reputations, which could also\ncause harm to our brand. From time to time, in response to changes in the business environment and the audience share of\nmarketing channels, we expect to reallocate marketing resources across social media and other channels. That reallocation\nmay not be effective or as successful as the marketing and advertising allocations of our competitors, which could\nnegatively impact the amount and timing of our revenues.\nWe may not be able to execute our strategy or achieve our planned growth targets, which could negatively impact our\nbusiness and our financial results.\nOur growth strategy depends on our and our franchisees’ ability to open new restaurants and to operate them on a profitable\nbasis. We expect substantially all of our international unit growth and much of our domestic unit growth to be franchised\nunits. Accordingly, our profitability increasingly depends upon royalty revenues from franchisees. If our franchisees are\nnot able to operate their businesses successfully under our franchised business model, our results could suffer.\nAdditionally, we may fail to attract new qualified franchisees or existing franchisees may close underperforming locations.\nPlanned growth targets and the ability to operate new and existing restaurants profitably are affected by economic,\nregulatory and competitive conditions and consumer buying habits. A decrease in sales, such as what we experienced in\n2018 and the first half of 2019, or increased commodity or operating costs, including, but not limited to, employee\ncompensation and benefits or insurance costs, could slow the rate of new store openings or increase the number of store\nclosings. Our business is susceptible to adverse changes in local, national and global economic conditions, which could\nmake it difficult for us to meet our growth targets. Additionally, we or our franchisees may face challenges securing\nfinancing, finding suitable store locations at acceptable terms or securing required domestic or foreign government permits\nand approvals. Declines in comparable sales, net store openings and related operating profits can impact our stock price.\nIf we do not continue to improve future sales and operating results and meet our related growth targets or external\nexpectations for net restaurant openings or our other strategic objectives in the future, our stock price could decline.\nOur franchisees remain dependent on the availability of financing to remodel or renovate existing locations, upgrade\nsystems and enhance technology, or construct and open new restaurants. From time to time, the Company may provide\nfinancing to certain franchisees and prospective franchisees in order to mitigate store closings, allow new units to open, or\ncomplete required upgrades. If we are unable or unwilling to provide such financing, which is a function of, among other\nthings, a franchisee’s creditworthiness, the number of new restaurant openings may be slower or the rate of closures may\nbe higher than expected and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. To the extent we provide financing to\nfranchisees, our results could be negatively impacted by negative performance of these franchisee loans.\nOur dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers for some ingredients could result in disruptions to our\nbusiness.\nDomestic restaurants purchase substantially all food and related products from our QC Centers. We are dependent on\nLeprino Foods Dairy Products Company (“Leprino”) as our sole supplier for mozzarella cheese, one of our key ingredients.\nLeprino, one of the major pizza category suppliers of cheese in the United States, currently supplies all of our mozzarella\ncheese domestically and substantially all of our mozzarella cheese internationally. We also depend on a sole source for\nour supply of certain desserts and garlic sauce, which constitute less than 10% of our domestic Company-owned restaurant\nsales. While we have no other sole sources of supply for key ingredients or menu items, we do source other key ingredients\nfrom a limited number of suppliers. Alternative sources of mozzarella cheese, desserts, other key ingredients or menu\nitems may not be available on a timely basis or may not be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current\narrangements.\nOur Company-owned and franchised restaurants could also be harmed by supply chain interruptions including those caused\nby factors beyond our control or the control of our suppliers. Prolonged disruption in the supply of products from or to\nour QC Centers due to weather, climate change, natural disasters, COVID-19, crop disease, food safety incidents,\nregulatory compliance, labor dispute or interruption of service by carriers could increase costs, limit the availability of\ningredients critical to our restaurant operations and have a significant impact on results. In particular, adverse weather or\n15\nTable of Contents\ncrop disease affecting the California tomato crop could disrupt the supply of pizza sauce to our and our franchisees’\nrestaurants. Insolvency of key suppliers could also cause similar business interruptions and negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on third parties for certain business processes and services, and failure or inability of such third-party vendors\nto perform subjects us to risks, including business disruption and increased costs.\nWe depend on the performance of suppliers and other third parties in our business operations. Third-party business\nprocesses we utilize include information technology, gift card authorization and processing, other payment processing,\nbenefits, and other accounting and business services. We conduct third-party due diligence and seek to obtain contractual\nassurance that our vendors will maintain adequate controls, such as adequate security against data breaches. However, the\nfailure of our suppliers to maintain adequate controls or comply with our expectations and standards could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nChanges in purchasing practices by our domestic franchisees could harm our commissary business.\nAlthough our domestic franchisees currently purchase substantially all food products from our QC Centers, the only\nrequired QC Center purchases by franchisees are pizza sauce, dough and other items we may designate as proprietary or\nintegral to our system. Any changes in purchasing practices by domestic franchisees, such as seeking alternative approved\nsuppliers of ingredients or other food products, could adversely affect the financial results of our QC Centers and the\nCompany.\nOur current insurance may not be adequate and we may experience claims in excess of our reserves.\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability, property, and\nhealth insurance coverage provided to our employees are funded by the Company up to certain retention levels under our\nretention programs. Retention limits generally range from $1,000 to $1.0 million. These insurance programs may not be\nadequate to protect us, and it may be difficult or impossible to obtain additional coverage or maintain current coverage at\na reasonable cost. We also have experienced claims volatility and high costs for our insurance programs. We estimate loss\nreserves based on historical trends, actuarial assumptions and other data available to us, but we may not be able to\naccurately estimate reserves. If we experience claims in excess of our projections, our business could be negatively\nimpacted. Our franchisees could be similarly impacted by higher claims experience, hurting both their operating results\nand/or limiting their ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost.\nWe are subject to debt covenant restrictions.\nOur credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants. If a covenant violation\noccurs or is expected to occur, we would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the lenders under the credit\nagreement. The failure to obtain a waiver or amendment on a timely basis would result in our inability to borrow additional\nfunds or obtain letters of credit under our credit agreement and allow the lenders under our credit agreement to declare our\nloan obligations due and payable, require us to cash collateralize outstanding letters of credit or increase our interest rate.\nIf any of the foregoing events occur, we would need to refinance our debt, or renegotiate or restructure, the terms of the\ncredit agreement.\nWith our indebtedness, we may have reduced availability of cash flow for other purposes. Increases in interest rates would\nalso increase our debt service costs and could materially impact our profitability as well as the profitability of our\nfranchisees.\nCurrent debt levels under our existing credit facility may reduce available cash flow to plan for or react to business changes,\nchanges in the industry or any general adverse economic conditions. Under our credit facility, we are exposed to variable\ninterest rates. We have entered into interest rate swaps that fix a significant portion of our variable interest rate risk.\nHowever, by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we also expose ourselves to\ncredit risk. Credit risk is due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.\nHigher inflation, and a related increase in costs, including rising interest rates, could also impact our franchisees and their\nability to open new restaurants or operate existing restaurants profitably.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the loans under our credit facility accrue interest at a per annum rate that may include, at the Company’s\nelection, a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom\nFinancial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced its intention to phase out the use of LIBOR\nby the end of 2021. However, the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration, in its capacity as administrator\nof USD LIBOR, has announced that it intends to extend publication of USD LIBOR (other than one-week and two-month\ntenors) by 18 months to June 2023. Notwithstanding this possible extension, a joint statement by key regulatory authorities\ncalls on banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31,\n2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee\ncomprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S.-dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (\"SOFR\"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities.\nAlthough SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, at this time, it is not possible to\ndefinitively predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, any phase out of LIBOR or any establishment of alternative\nbenchmark rates, including SOFR. The cessation of LIBOR will require us to amend the terms of our credit facility or any\nfuture credit agreements extending beyond June 2023 and indexed to LIBOR to replace LIBOR with SOFR or such other\nstandard that is established, which could have a material adverse effect on us, including on our cost of funds, access to\ncapital markets and financial results.\nInvestment Risks\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a limited duration stockholder rights agreement, which could delay or discourage a\nmerger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by our Board of Directors.\nOn April 30, 2019, the Company’s stockholders ratified the adoption by the Board of Directors of the Rights Agreement,\ndated as of July 22, 2018, as amended on February 3, 2019, March 6, 2019, and October 23, 2019 (as amended, the “Rights\nAgreement”). The original Rights Agreement adopted by the Board of Directors on July 22, 2018 had an expiration date\nof July 22, 2019 and a beneficial ownership trigger threshold of 15%. On February 3, 2019, in connection with the sale\nand issuance of shares of the Company’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”) to certain\nfunds affiliated with, or managed by, Starboard Value LP (collectively, “Starboard”), the original Rights Agreement was\namended to exempt Starboard from being considered an “Acquiring Person” under the Rights Agreement solely as a result\nof its beneficial ownership of (i) shares of common stock beneficially owned by Starboard prior to the sale and issuance\nof the Series B Preferred Stock, (ii) shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued or issuable to Starboard under the terms of\nthe Securities Purchase Agreement, dated February 3, 2019, with Starboard (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”), and\n(iii) shares of the common stock (or in certain circumstances certain series of preferred stock) issuable upon conversion of\nthe Series B Preferred Stock (or certain series of preferred stock issuable on conversion thereof) pursuant to the terms of\nthe Certificate of Designation of Series B Preferred Stock. On March 6, 2019, the Rights Agreement was further amended\nto extend the term of the Rights Agreement to March 6, 2022, increase the beneficial ownership trigger threshold at which\na person becomes an acquiring person from 15% to 20%, except for a “grandfathered person” provision, and make certain\nother changes. The Rights Agreement was further amended on October 23, 2019 to eliminate the “grandfathered person”\nprovision as there are no stockholders that currently beneficially own 20% or more of the Company’s common stock.\nThe Rights Agreement is intended to enable all of our stockholders to realize the full potential value of their investment in\nthe Company and to protect the interests of the Company and its stockholders by reducing the likelihood that any person\nor group gains control of the Company through open market accumulation or other tactics without paying an appropriate\ncontrol premium. The Rights Agreement could render more difficult, or discourage, a merger, tender offer, or assumption\nof control of the Company that is not approved by our Board of Directors. The Rights Agreement, however, should not\ninterfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination approved by our Board of Directors. In\naddition, the Rights Agreement does not prevent our Board of Directors from considering any offer that it considers to be\nin the best interest of the Company’s stockholders.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe issuance of shares of our Series B Preferred Stock to Starboard and its permitted transferees dilutes the ownership\nand relative voting power of holders of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company sold 250,000 shares of our newly designated Series B\nPreferred Stock to Starboard in 2019.\nAs of December 27, 2020, the shares held by Starboard represent 13.3% of our outstanding common stock on an as-\nconverted basis. The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of common\nstock based on the conversion rate determined by dividing $1,000, the stated value of the Series B Preferred Stock, by\n$50.06.\nBecause holders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our\ncommon stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, the issuance of the Series B Preferred\nStock to Starboard effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock into common stock would dilute the ownership interest of\nexisting holders of our common stock. Furthermore, any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon\nconversion of the Series B Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Pursuant\nto a customary registration rights agreement with Starboard, we have registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933\nthe shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series B Preferred\nStock. This registration may facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would\nincrease the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales by Starboard of a substantial number\nof shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material\nadverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur Series B Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights\nof, our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, result in the interests of\nholders of our Series B Preferred Stock differing from those of our common stockholders and delay or prevent an attempt\nto take over the Company.\nStarboard and the other holders of our Series B Preferred Stock have a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid,\nbefore any payment may be made to holders of our common stock in connection with a liquidation event, an amount per\nshare of Series B Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (i) the stated value thereof plus accrued and unpaid dividends and\n(ii) the amount that would have been received had such share of Series B Preferred Stock been converted into common\nstock immediately prior to such liquidation event.\nHolders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to a preferential cumulative dividend at the rate of 3.6% per annum,\npayable quarterly in arrears. On the third anniversary of the date of issuance, each holder of Series B Preferred Stock will\nhave the right to increase the dividend on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such holder to 5.6%, and on the\nfifth anniversary of the date of issuance, each holder will have the right to increase the dividend on the shares of Series B\nPreferred Stock held by such holder to 7.6% (in each case subject to the Company’s right to redeem some or all of such\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock for cash).\nThe holders of our Series B Preferred Stock also have certain redemption rights or put rights, including the right on any\ndate following November 6, 2026 to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Series B Preferred Stock. Holders\nof the Series B Preferred Stock also have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to require us to repurchase all or any\nportion of the Series B Preferred Stock upon certain change of control events.\nThese dividend and share repurchase obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available\nfor working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our\nobligations to Starboard, as the initial holder of our Series B Preferred Stock, could also limit our ability to obtain additional\nfinancing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential\nrights could also result in divergent interests between Starboard and holders of our common stock. Furthermore, a sale of\nour Company, as a change of control event, may require us to repurchase Series B Preferred Stock, which could have the\n18\nTable of Contents\neffect of making an acquisition of the Company more expensive and potentially deterring proposed transactions that may\notherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nStarboard may exercise influence over us, including through its ability to designate up to two members of our Board of\nDirectors.\nThe transaction documents entered into in connection with the sale of the Series B Preferred Stock to Starboard grant to\nStarboard consent rights with respect to certain actions by us, including:\n• amending our organizational documents in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the Series B Preferred\nStock;\n• issuing securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series B Preferred Stock; and\n• increasing the maximum number of directors on our Board to more than eleven persons or twelve persons, subject\nto the terms of the Governance Agreement (the “Governance Agreement”) entered into in connection with the\nSecurities Purchase Agreement.\nThe Securities Purchase Agreement also imposes a number of affirmative and negative covenants on us. As a result,\nStarboard has the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted for the vote of the holders of our common stock.\nStarboard and its affiliates are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses\nthat may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business, and they may have interests that diverge\nfrom, or even conflict with, those of our other stockholders. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be\ncomplementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nIn addition, the terms of the Governance Agreement grant Starboard certain rights to designate directors to be nominated\nfor election by holders of our common stock. For so long as certain criteria set forth in the Governance Agreement are\nsatisfied, including that Starboard beneficially own, in the aggregate, at least (i) 89,264 shares of Series B Preferred Stock\nor (ii) the lesser of 5.0% of the Company’s then-outstanding common stock (on an as-converted basis, if applicable) and\n1,783,141 shares of issued and outstanding common stock (subject to adjustment for stock splits, reclassifications,\ncombinations and similar adjustments), Starboard has the right to designate two directors for election to our Board,\nconsisting of one nominee who is affiliated with Starboard and one independent nominee.\nThe directors designated by Starboard also are entitled to serve on committees of our Board, subject to applicable law and\nstock exchange rules. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable\nlaw, the interests of the directors designated by Starboard may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole\nor of our other directors.\nWe may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance a required repurchase of our Series B Preferred Stock.\nAfter November 6, 2026, each holder of Series B Preferred Stock will have the right, upon 90 days’ notice, to require the\nCompany to repurchase all or any portion of the Series B Preferred Stock for cash at a price equal to $1,000 per share of\nSeries B Preferred Stock plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. In addition, upon certain change of control events, holders\nof Series B Preferred Stock can require us, subject to certain exceptions, to repurchase any or all of their Series B Preferred\nStock.\nIt is possible that we would not have sufficient funds to make any required repurchase of Series B Preferred Stock.\nMoreover, we may not be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price.\n19\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risks\nNatural disasters, hostilities, social unrest, severe weather and other catastrophic events may disrupt our operations or\nsupply chain.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster, hostilities, cyber-attack, social unrest, terrorist activity, outbreak of epidemic,\npandemic or contagious disease, power outages, severe weather (such as tornados, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods,\nheat waves, etc.) or other catastrophic events may disrupt our operations or supply chain and result in the closure of our\nrestaurants (Company-owned or franchised), our corporate offices, any of our QC Centers or the facilities of our suppliers,\nand can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence levels and supply availability and costs, any of which\ncould materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIncreasingly complex laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in an increasingly complex regulatory environment, and the cost of regulatory compliance is increasing. Our\nfailure, or the failure of any of our franchisees, to comply with applicable U.S. and international labor, health care, food,\nhealth and safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery and corruption, competition, environmental and other laws may result\nin civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties. Enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal\nrequirements, and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs\nand create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or\noperating results. Increased regulatory scrutiny of food matters and product marketing claims, and increased litigation and\nenforcement actions may increase compliance and legal costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition or operating results. Governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact\nour business. For example, some local government agencies have implemented ordinances that restrict the sale of certain\nfood or drink products.\nCompliance with new or additional domestic and international government laws or regulations, including the European\nUnion General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) which could\nincrease costs for compliance. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently\nand increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk\nand costs. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to reputational damage and significant\nlitigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in various jurisdictions. For example, a failure to\ncomply with the GDPR could result in fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues.\nDisruptions of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to compete and conduct our\nbusiness.\nOur critical business and information technology systems have in the past, and could in the future be damaged or\ninterrupted by power loss, various technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks, sabotage or acts of God. In particular,\nthe Company and our franchisees have experienced occasional interruptions of our digital ordering solutions, which make\nonline ordering unavailable or slow to respond, negatively impacting sales and the experience of our customers. If our\ndigital ordering solutions do not perform with adequate speed and security, our customers may be less inclined to return\nto our digital ordering solutions.\nPart of our technology infrastructure, such as our domestic point-of-sale system, is specifically designed for us and our\noperational systems, which could cause unexpected costs, delays or inefficiencies when infrastructure upgrades are needed\nor prolonged and widespread technological difficulties occur. Significant portions of our technology infrastructure,\nparticularly in our digital ordering solutions, are provided by third parties, and the performance of these systems is largely\nbeyond our control. Occasionally, we have experienced or could experience temporary disruptions in our business due to\nthird-party systems failing to adequately perform. Failure to manage future failures of these systems, particularly as our\nonline sales grow, could harm our business and the satisfaction of our customers. Such third-party systems could be\ndisrupted either through system failure or if third party vendor patents and contractual agreements do not afford us\nprotection against similar technology. In addition, we may not have or be able to obtain adequate protection or insurance\n20\nTable of Contents\nto mitigate the risks of these events or compensate for losses related to these events, which could damage our business and\nreputation and be expensive and difficult to remedy or repair.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in damage to our reputation, loss of sales, and/or\nsubject us to litigation, penalties or significant costs.\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations. We collect and retain large volumes of\ninternal and customer data, including credit card data and other personally identifiable information of our employees and\ncustomers housed in the various information systems we use. Constantly changing information security threats, particularly\npersistent cyber security threats, pose risks to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability\nand integrity of our data and the availability and integrity of our critical business functions. As techniques used in cyber-\nattacks evolve, we may not be able to timely detect threats or anticipate and implement adequate security measures. The\nintegrity and protection of the customer, employee, franchisee and Company data are critical to us. Our information\ntechnology systems and databases, and those provided by our third-party vendors, including international vendors, have\nbeen and will continue to be subject to computer viruses, malware attacks, unauthorized user attempts, phishing and denial\nof service and other malicious cyber-attacks. The failure to prevent fraud or security breaches or to adequately invest in\ndata security could harm our business and revenues due to the reputational damage to our brand. Such a breach could also\nresult in litigation, regulatory actions, penalties, and other significant costs to us and have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial results. These costs could be significant and well in excess of, or not covered by, our cyber insurance coverage.\nWe have been and will continue to be subject to various types of investigations and litigation, including collective and\nclass action litigation, which could subject us to significant damages or other remedies.\nWe are subject to the risk of investigations and litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, franchisees,\nstate and federal agencies, stockholders and employees. From time to time, we are involved in a number of lawsuits,\nclaims, investigations, and proceedings consisting of securities, antitrust, intellectual property, employment, consumer,\npersonal injury, corporate governance, commercial and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.\nWe have been subject to claims in cases containing collective and class action allegations. Plaintiffs in these types of\nlawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense\ncosts relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. Litigation trends involving personal injury, employment\nlaw, intellectual property and the relationship between franchisors and franchisees may increase our cost of doing business.\nWe evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we\nestimate the amount of potential losses to us. In many cases, particularly collective and class action cases, we may not be\nable to estimate the amount of potential losses and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient. These assessments are\nmade by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of\njudgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or\nwhether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our\noperations and negatively impact earnings. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from\nthese types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.\nWe may be subject to harassment or discrimination claims and legal proceedings. Our Code of Ethics and Business\nConduct policies prohibit harassment and discrimination in the workplace, in sexual or in any other form. To monitor and\nenforce these policies, we have ongoing programs for workplace training and compliance, and we investigate and take\ndisciplinary action with respect to alleged violations. Nevertheless, actions by our team members could violate those\npolicies. Franchisees and suppliers are also required to comply with all applicable laws and govern themselves with\nintegrity. Any violations (or perceptions thereof) by our franchisees or suppliers could have a negative impact on consumer\nperceptions of us and our business and create reputational or other harm to the Company.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could negatively affect our results of\noperations.\nWe depend on the Papa John’s brand name and rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and similar\nintellectual property rights to protect and promote our brand. We believe the success of our business depends on our\ncontinued ability to exclusively use our existing marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand, both\ndomestically and abroad. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and we may be required\nto pursue litigation to prevent consumer confusion and preserve our brand’s high-quality reputation. Litigation could result\nin high costs and diversion of resources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, regardless of the outcome.\nWe may be subject to impairment charges.\nImpairment charges are possible due to the nature and timing of decisions we make about underperforming assets or\nmarkets, or if previously opened or acquired restaurants perform below our expectations. This could result in a decrease\nin our reported asset value and reduction in our net income.\nWe operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results.\nWe operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. We have international operations and\ngenerate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions. The domestic and international tax environments\ncontinue to evolve as a result of tax changes in various jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the tax laws in\ncertain countries, including the United States, could impact our future operating results. A significant increase in the\nU.S. corporate tax rate could negatively impact our financial results.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n22\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nPapa John’s International, Inc. (referred to as the “Company,” “Papa John’s” or in the first-person notations of “we,” “us”\nand “our”) began operations in 1984. At December 27, 2020, there were 5,400 Papa John’s restaurants in operation,\nconsisting of 588 Company-owned and 4,812 franchised restaurants. Our revenues are derived from retail sales of pizza\nand other food and beverage products to the general public by Company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties, and sales\nof franchise and development rights. Additionally, approximately 46% to 48% of our North America revenues in each of\nthe last two fiscal years were derived from sales to franchisees of various items including food and paper products from\nour domestic Quality Control Centers (“QC Centers”), printing and promotional items and information systems equipment,\nand software and related services. We also derive revenues from the operation of our international QC center in the United\nKingdom and from contributions received by Papa John’s Marketing Fund (“PJMF”), our national marketing fund. We\nbelieve that in addition to supporting both Company and franchised profitability and growth, these activities contribute to\nproduct quality and consistency throughout the Papa John’s system.\nWe strive to obtain high-quality restaurant sites with good access and visibility and to enhance the appearance and quality\nof our restaurants. We believe these factors improve our image and brand awareness. Detailed below are progressions of\nour Domestic and International restaurants over the last two fiscal years:\nDomestic Franchised\nCompany- North Total North\nowned America America International System-wide\nBeginning - December 30, 2018 645 2,692 3,337 1,966 5,303\nOpened 3 76 79 233 312\nClosed (5) (123) (128) (92) (220)\nAcquired 1 46 47 — 47\nSold (46) (1) (47) — (47)\nEnding - December 29, 2019 598 2,690 3,288 2,107 5,395\nOpened 2 62 64 156 220\nClosed (12) (51) (63) (152) (215)\nEnding - December 27, 2020 588 2,701 3,289 2,111 5,400\nRecent Business Matters\nIn 2020, the Company focused on executing the strategic priorities and building a foundation for long-term success,\nincluding the specific items described below.\nInnovation. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company has embraced a new culture of innovation, delivering\nmultiple new product innovations and marketing successes. In 2020, we launched Garlic Parmesan Crust Pizza, toasted\nhandheld “Papadias” flatbread-style sandwiches, Jalapeno Popper Rolls, and the Shaq-a-Roni pizza. Of particular\nhighlight, the Shaq-a-Roni pizza was launched as part of a fund-raiser for The Papa John’s Foundation, in collaboration\nwith Shaquille O’Neal, our board member and restaurant owner. The Shaq-a-Roni pizza was a differentiated, high-value\nproduct, with a charitable component that supported meaningful causes aligned with our brand’s values. In the fourth\nquarter of 2020, we also tested Epic Stuffed Crust, which was officially launched in 2021. Epic Stuffed Crust was the\nCompany’s biggest new product launch to date and builds upon our original fresh, never frozen, six-ingredient dough.\nProduct innovation is not only an important part of our plan for 2021 to continue building sales but also represents another\nplatform for our longer-term strategy and opportunity.\n32\nTable of Contents\nNovel Coronavirus (“COVID-19”).

Subsequently, the outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health\nOrganization on March 11, 2020 and declared a national emergency in the United States during the same timeframe. The\noutbreak has presented evolving risks and developments domestically and internationally, as well as new opportunities for\nour business.

The Company has taken\nsteps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing extra health and safety measures across our\nbusiness, including No Contact Delivery and enhanced cleaning and sanitization measures, for the protection of both our\ncustomers and team members. We have expanded our employee benefits to include free virtual doctor visits and paid\nspecial bonuses to many of our front-line team members. This is in addition to existing employee benefits of no-cost mental\nhealth support, affordable health plan options and access to the Papa John’s Team Member Emergency Relief Fund, if and\nwhen needed. In addition, the Company hired thousands of new restaurant team members in 2020 to help meet demand\nand serve our customers.\nOf the Company’s 2,111 international franchised stores, approximately 65 stores were temporarily closed as of December\n27, 2020, principally in Latin America and Europe, in accordance with government policies. In North America, almost all\ntraditional restaurants remain open and fully operational. A number of non-traditional restaurants located in universities\nand stadiums are temporarily closed; these non-traditional locations are not significant to our revenues and operating\nresults.\nWe believe the pandemic has accelerated our previously announced efforts to innovate and bring new and former\ncustomers to the Papa John’s system. We believe that even after the pandemic-related restrictions are lifted we will benefit\nfrom the increase in customers we have experienced due to our menu innovation, customer loyalty programs and our\nofferings of high-quality pizza and other menu items. Due to the substantial uncertainty related to the effects of the\npandemic and its duration, we are unable to predict the specific impact the pandemic and related restrictions will have on\nour results of operations, liquidity or long-term financial condition, including whether and to what extent the increased\ndemand for our products will continue. For a discussion of the risks to our business presented by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nsee Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\nStrategic Corporate Reorganization for Long-term Growth. In the third quarter of 2020, we announced plans to open an\noffice in Atlanta, Georgia located in Three Ballpark Center at The Battery Atlanta in the summer of 2021. The Atlanta\noffice is part of a broader strategic reorganization of corporate functions reflecting the Company’s ongoing transformation\ninto a brand and culture that can effectively and efficiently deliver on the Company’s purpose, values and strategic business\npriorities. Affected employees who do not relocate to Atlanta have been offered a separation package. As a result, we\nexpect to incur certain one-time corporate reorganization costs of approximately $15.0 to $20.0 million related to employee\nseverance and transition, recruitment and relocation and other third-party costs through 2021. Of that amount, we incurred\ncosts of approximately $6.0 million in 2020.\n33\nTable of Contents\nPresentation of Financial Results\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of Consolidated Financial\nStatements requires management to select accounting policies for critical accounting areas as well as estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s significant\naccounting policies, including recently issued accounting pronouncements, are more fully described in “Note 2” of “Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements.” Significant changes in assumptions and/or conditions in our critical accounting\npolicies could materially impact the operating results. We have identified the following accounting policies and related\njudgments as critical to understanding the results of our operations:\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Accounts and Franchisee Notes Receivable\nAs of December 27, 2020, accounts receivable was $93.8 million with an allowance for credit losses of $3.6 million and\nfranchisee notes receivable was $51.1 million with an allowance for credit losses of $3.2 million. As of December 29,\n2019, accounts receivable was $77.8 million with an allowance for credit losses of $7.3 million and franchisee notes\nreceivable was $44.4 million with an allowance for credit losses of $3.6 million. Estimates of expected credit losses, even\nif remote, are based upon historical account write-off trends, facts about the current financial condition of the debtor,\nforecasts of future operating results based upon current trends of select operating metrics, and macroeconomic factors. The\nallowance for credit losses on franchisee note receivables is based on review of each franchisee’s economic performance\nand market conditions after consideration of the fair value of our underlying collateral rights (e.g., underlying franchisee\nbusiness, property and equipment) and any guarantees. Credit quality is monitored through the timing of payments\ncompared to the prescribed payment terms and known facts regarding the financial condition of the franchisee or customer.\nAccount and note receivable balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased.\nInsurance Reserves\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability, property, and\nhealth insurance coverage provided to our employees are funded by the Company up to certain retention levels under our\nretention programs. Retention limits generally range from $1,000 to $1.0 million.\nAs of December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, our insurance reserves were $82.0 million and $75.2 million,\nrespectively. Losses are accrued based upon undiscounted estimates of the liability for claims incurred and for events that\nhave occurred but have not been reported using certain third-party actuarial projections and our claims loss experience.\nThe determination of the recorded insurance reserves is highly judgmental and complex due to the significant uncertainty\nin the potential value of reported claims and the number and potential value of incurred but not reported claims, the\napplication of significant judgment in making those estimates and the use of various actuarial valuation methods. The\nestimated insurance claims losses could be significantly affected should the frequency or ultimate cost of claims differ\nsignificantly from historical trends used to estimate the insurance reserves recorded by the Company. The Company\nrecords estimated losses above retention within its reserve with a corresponding receivable for expected amounts due from\ninsurance carriers.\n34\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets — Goodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever we identify certain triggering events or circumstances\nthat would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such tests are\ncompleted separately with respect to the goodwill of each of our reporting units. We may perform a qualitative assessment\nor move directly to the quantitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period if we believe that it is more efficient\nor if impairment indicators exist.\nWe elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our operations in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result of our\nqualitative analyses, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater\nthan their carrying amounts. Subsequent to completing our goodwill impairment tests, no indicators of impairment were\nidentified. See “Note 12” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\nIncome Tax Accounts and Tax Reserves\nPapa John’s is subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining Papa John’s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for\nincome taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable and those deferred.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets\nand liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences\nreverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax attribute carryforwards (e.g., net\noperating losses, capital losses, and foreign tax credits). The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized\nin the period in which the new tax rate is enacted. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional\nbasis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to realize.\nTax authorities periodically audit the Company. We record reserves and related interest and penalties for identified\nexposures as income tax expense. We evaluate these issues and adjust for events, such as statute of limitations expirations,\ncourt rulings or audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. We recognized a decrease\nin income tax expense of $500,000 and $400,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively, associated with the finalization of certain\nincome tax matters. See “Note 18” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December of each year. All fiscal years presented in the accompanying\nConsolidated Financial Statements consist of 52 weeks.\n35\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\n2020 Compared to 2019\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between\nfiscal 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2019 and 2018 that are not\nincluded in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29,\n2019.\nDiscussion of Revenues. Consolidated revenues increased $194.0 million, or 12.0%, to $1.81 billion in 2020, compared\nto $1.62 billion in 2019. Revenues are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands).\nYear Ended\nDec. 27, Dec. 29, Percent\n2020 2019 Increase Change\nDomestic Company-owned restaurant sales $ 700,757 $ 652,053 $ 48,704 7.5 %\nNorth America franchise royalties and fees 96,732 71,828 24,904 34.7 %\nNorth America commissary revenues 680,793 612,652 68,141 11.1 %\nInternational revenues 123,963 102,924 21,039 20.4 %\nOther revenues 210,989 179,791 31,198 17.4 %\nTotal revenues $ 1,813,234 $ 1,619,248 $ 193,986 12.0 %\nDomestic Company-owned restaurant sales increased $48.7 million, or 7.5%, in 2020. Excluding the impact of\nrefranchising 46 restaurants in 2019 primarily located in South Florida and Georgia, Domestic Company-owned restaurant\nsales increased $79.2 million, or 12.7%. The increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales of 14.2%, partially\noffset by the 2019 favorable impact from the expiration of customer rewards associated with our Papa Rewards loyalty\nprogram of $6.0 million. “Comparable sales” represents the change in year-over-year sales for the same base of restaurants\nfor the same fiscal periods.\nNorth America franchise royalties and fees increased $24.9 million, or 34.7%, in 2020. Excluding the impact of\nrefranchising, North America franchise royalties and fees increased $22.9 million, or 31.9%. The increase was primarily\ndue to positive comparable sales of 18.6%. Franchise royalties and fees in 2020 also reflect a higher effective royalty rate\ndue to lower temporary royalty relief which was part of our franchise assistance program (see “Temporary Franchise\nSupport”).\nNorth America franchise restaurant sales increased 18.6% to $2.49 billion for 2020 compared to prior year. North America\nfranchise restaurant sales are not included in Company revenues; however, our North America franchise royalties are\nderived from these sales.\nNorth America commissary revenues increased $68.1 million, or 11.1%, primarily due to higher volumes and pricing\nassociated with higher commodities costs, primarily cheese.\nInternational revenues increased $21.0 million, or 20.4%, in 2020 primarily due to higher PJUK commissary revenues and\nhigher royalties from higher comparable sales of 12.6%.\nInternational franchise restaurant sales increased 15.5% to $1.0 billion in 2020, excluding the impact of foreign currency,\nprimarily due to increases in comparable sales. International franchise restaurant sales are not included in Company\nrevenues; however, our international royalty revenue is derived from these sales.\nOther revenues, which primarily includes our North America marketing funds, online and mobile ordering business and\nour wholly-owned print and promotions subsidiary, increased $31.2 million, or 17.4% in 2020 primarily due to higher\nmarketing fund revenues from an increase in franchise sales and an increase in the national marketing fund contribution\nrate in 2020 and higher online revenues from increased restaurant sales.\n36\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion of Operating Results\nOperating income is summarized in the following table on a reporting segment basis. Operating income increased\napproximately $65.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2020 as compared to the prior year. Alongside the GAAP\noperating income data, we have included “adjusted” operating income to exclude Special items. Special items for 2020\ninclude strategic corporate reorganization costs associated with our new office in Atlanta, Georgia projected to open in the\nsummer of 2021. The reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, as well as the Special items, are included in\n“Items Impacting Comparability; Non-GAAP Measures.” We believe these non-GAAP measures are important for\ncomparability purposes.\nYear Ended\nReported Special Adjusted Reported Special Adjusted Adjusted\nDec. 27, items Dec. 27, Dec. 29, items Dec. 29, Increase\n(In thousands) 2020 in 2020 2020 2019 in 2019 2019 (Decrease)\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants $ 37,049 $ — $ 37,049 $ 33,957 $ (4,739) $ 29,218 $ 7,831\nNorth America franchising 89,801 — 89,801 64,362 — 64,362 25,439\nNorth America commissaries 33,185 — 33,185 30,690 — 30,690 2,495\nInternational 24,034 — 24,034 18,738 — 18,738 5,296\nAll others 7,043 — 7,043 (1,966) — (1,966) 9,009\nUnallocated corporate expenses (100,069) 5,985 (94,084) (120,280) 14,221 (106,059) 11,975\nElimination of intersegment profits (790) — (790) (966) — (966) 176\nAdjusted operating income $ 90,253 $ 5,985 $ 96,238 $ 24,535 $ 9,482 $ 34,017 $ 62,221\nThe increase in operating income of $65.7 million, and increase in adjusted operating income of $62.2 million in 2020,\nexcluding Special items, was primarily due to the following:\n• Domestic Company-owned Restaurants Segment. Domestic Company-owned restaurants operating income\nincreased $7.8 million for 2020 as compared to the prior year comparable period. The increase was primarily due\nto higher profits from positive comparable sales of 14.2%, partially offset by labor initiatives and bonus expenses,\nincluding a special end-of-year bonus for front-line team members, and higher commodities costs. Additionally,\n2019 benefited from the expiration of customer rewards associated with our Papa Rewards loyalty program of\n$6.0 million.\n• North America Franchising Segment. North America franchising operating income increased $25.4 million\nfor 2020, primarily due to higher comparable sales of 18.6%. The fiscal year 2020 also benefited from a higher\neffective royalty rate compared to 2019 primarily due to lower royalty relief in 2020 as discussed in “Temporary\nFranchise Support.”\n• North America Commissaries Segment. North America commissaries operating income increased $2.5 million\nin 2020, primarily due to higher profits from higher volumes, partially offset by the bonus for front-line team\nmembers.\n• International Segment. International operating income increased $5.3 million for 2020 compared to the prior\nyear primarily due to higher royalty revenue, PJUK commissary income attributable to increased units and higher\ncomparable sales and lower travel costs due to COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by lower\nrevenues received from certain franchisees as a result of royalty support, higher bonuses and the unfavorable\nimpact of foreign exchange rates.\n• All Others. All Others operating income increased $9.0 million primarily due to higher online revenues, partially\noffset by timing of marketing spend in the prior year.\n37\nTable of Contents\n• Unallocated Corporate Expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased approximately $12.0 million in\n2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower marketing fund investments of $12.5 million as discussed in\n“Temporary Franchise Support”.\nReview of Consolidated Results\nRevenues. For the reasons discussed above, consolidated revenues increased $194.0 million, or 12.0%, to $1.81 billion in\n2020, compared to $1.62 billion in 2019.\nYear En de d\nDecember 27, 2020 December 29, 2019\n% of Related % of Related Increase\n($ in thousands) Revenues Revenues (Decrease)\nRevenues:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurant sales $ 700,757 $ 652,053\nNorth America franchise royalties and fees 96,732 71,828\nNorth America commissary revenues 680,793 612,652\nInternational revenues 123,963 102,924\nOther revenues 210,989 179,791\nTotal revenues 1,813,234 1,619,248\nCosts and expenses:\nOperating costs (excluding depreciation and\namortization shown separately below):\nDomestic Company-owned restaurant\nexpenses 563,799 80.5% 526,237 80.7% (0.2%)\nNorth America commissary expenses 630,937 92.7% 569,180 92.9% (0.2%)\nInternational expenses 73,994 59.7% 57,702 56.1% 3.6%\nOther expenses 200,304 94.9% 175,592 97.7% (2.8%)\nGeneral and administrative expenses 204,242 11.3% 223,460 13.8% (2.5%)\nDepreciation and amortization 49,705 2.7% 47,281 2.9% (0.2%)\nTotal costs and expenses 1,722,981 95.0% 1,599,452 98.8% (3.8%)\nRefranchising gains - 0.0% 4,739 0.3% (0.3%)\nOperating income 90,253 5.0% 24,535 1.5% 3.5%\nInvestment income 2,131 0.1% 1,104 0.1% 0.0%\nInterest expense (17,022) (0.9%) (20,593) (1.3%) 0.4%\nIncome before income taxes $ 75,362 4.2% $ 5,046 0.3% 3.9%\nCosts and expenses. Total costs and expenses were approximately $1.7 billion, or 95.0% of total revenues in 2020\ncompared to $1.6 billion, or 98.8%, in 2019. The decrease in total costs and expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was\nprimarily due to the following:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants expenses were $563.8 million in 2020, or 80.5% of related revenues, as compared\nto the prior year expenses of $526.2 million, or 80.7% of related revenues, in 2019. The 0.2% decrease, as a percentage\nof revenues, was primarily due to lower food costs, including the favorable impact of current year promotions which more\nthan offset higher commodities costs and lower operating expenses on higher sales. These decreases were partially offset\nby higher bonus expense and the 2019 favorable impact of the expiration of customer rewards with our Papa Rewards\nloyalty program.\nNorth America commissary expenses were $630.9 million in 2020, or 92.7% of related revenues compared to $569.2\nmillion in 2019, or 92.9% of related revenues in 2019.

The increase of 3.6% in expenses, as a percentage of related revenues, was\nprimarily due to the higher mix of United Kingdom commissary revenues which have a lower overall margin and lower\nrevenues resulting from increased royalty support provided to certain franchisees.\n38\nTable of Contents\nOther expenses were $200.3 million in 2020, or 94.9% of related revenues, compared to prior year expenses of $175.6\nmillion, or 97.7% of related revenues in 2019. The 2.8% decrease in expenses, as a percentage of related revenues, was\nprimarily due to higher margins from our online and mobile ordering business, partially offset by lower revenues at our\nprinting subsidiary.\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $204.2 million, or 11.3% of revenues for 2020 compared to $223.5\nmillion, or 13.8% of revenues for 2019.

See “Note 11” of “Notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased approximately $3.6 million for the year ended December 27, 2020 primarily\ndue to a decrease in the average outstanding debt balance and lower interest rates. Total debt outstanding was $350.0\nmillion as of December 27, 2020. Outstanding debt at December 27, 2020 decreased $20.0 million from December 29,\n2019 primarily due to repayments on our secured term loan facility.\nIncome before income taxes.

The effective income tax rate was 19.6% for 2020, compared to (12.1%) for 2019. The\neffective rate was higher in 2020 due to the impact of similar tax credit amounts on higher income before income taxes.\nThe 2019 income tax rate included a non-deductible $5.9 million expense associated with the one-time mark-to-market\nincrease in the fair value of the Starboard option to purchase Series B Preferred Stock, as previously mentioned.

Excluding Special items, adjusted diluted earnings per\ncommon share was $1.40, compared to $0.03 in 2019, representing an increase of $1.37. Diluted earnings per common\nshare was reduced by approximately $0.07 per share in 2020 ($0.09 impact when excluding Special items) due to income\nattributable to participating securities, including Series B Preferred Stockholders, based on undistributed earnings for 2020.\nSee “Note 8” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\n40\nTable of Contents\nItems Impacting Comparability; Non-GAAP Measures\nThe table below reconciles our GAAP financial results to our adjusted financial results, which are non-GAAP measures\n(collectively defined as “Special items”). The non-GAAP adjusted results shown below and within this Form 10-K, which\nexclude the Special items, should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the Company’s performance\nthan the Company’s GAAP results. Management believes presenting certain financial information excluding the Special\nitems is important for purposes of comparison to prior year results. In addition, management uses these metrics to evaluate\nthe Company’s underlying operating performance and to analyze trends. See “Results of Operations” for further analysis\nregarding the impact of the Special items, and “Note 8”, “Note 11”, and “Note 18” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements,” respectively, for additional information about the Special items.\nNote: Effective as of the first quarter of 2020, the Company modified its presentation of adjusted (non-GAAP) financial\nresults to no longer present certain financial assistance provided to the North America system in the form of royalty relief\nand discretionary marketing fund investments as Special charges.

Beginning in the third quarter of 2018, the Company began providing various forms of\nsupport and financial assistance to the North America franchise system in response to declining North America sales. In\nJuly 2019, the Company announced a formal relief program to provide our North America franchisees with certainty\nregarding the availability and schedule of the temporary relief which concluded in the third quarter of 2020. The Company\nprovided royalty relief and discretionary marketing fund investments to franchisees in North America, included herein as\n“Temporary Franchise Support” of $29.3 million (or approximately $0.69 per diluted share) for 2020, compared to $46.6\nmillion (or approximately $1.14 per diluted share) for 2019, as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 27, December 29,\n2020 2019\nRoyalty relief (a) $ 14,270 $ 19,096\nMarketing fund investments (b) 15,000 27,500\nTotal Temporary Franchise Support $ 29,270 $ 46,596\n(a) Represents financial assistance provided to the North America system in the form of temporary royalty reductions\nthat are above and beyond the level of franchise assistance the Company would incur in the ordinary course of\nits business. These royalty reductions are not an expense, but rather consist of the amount of waived royalties that\nthe Company would otherwise have been entitled to absent the waiver. The waived royalties are not included in\nNorth America franchise royalties and fees revenues.\n(b) Represents incremental discretionary marketing fund investments in excess of contractual Company-owned\nrestaurant-level contributions, which were made as part of the temporary financial support package to our\nfranchisees. The marketing fund investments are included in Unallocated corporate expenses.\n42\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we present free cash flow in this report, which is a non-GAAP measure. We define free cash flow as net cash\nprovided by operating activities (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows) less the purchases of property and\nequipment and dividends paid to preferred stockholders. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one\nfactor that management uses in determining the amount of cash available for discretionary investment. Free cash flow is\nnot a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our measure of free cash flow might not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies. Free cash flow should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of our\nperformance than the Company’s GAAP measures. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a reconciliation of free cash\nflow to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nThe presentation of the non-GAAP measures in this report is made alongside the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDebt\nThe Company has a secured revolving credit facility with available borrowings of $400.0 million (the “Revolving\nFacility”), of which $10.0 million was outstanding as of December 27, 2020, and a secured term loan facility with an\noutstanding balance of $340.0 million (the “Term Loan Facility”) and together with the Revolving Facility, the “PJI\nFacilities”. Including outstanding letters of credit, the Company’s remaining availability under the PJI Facilities at\nDecember 27, 2020 was approximately $344.2 million.\nWe use interest rate swaps to hedge against the effects of potential interest rate increases on borrowings under our PJI\nFacilities. As of December 27, 2020, we have the following interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of\n$350.0 million:\nEffective Dates F loating Rate Debt Fixed Rates\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 55 million 2.33 %\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 35 million 2.36 %\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 35 million 2.34 %\nJanuary 30, 2018 through August 30, 2022 $ 100 million 1.99 %\nJanuary 30, 2018 through August 30, 2022 $ 75 million 1.99 %\nJanuary 30, 2018 through August 30, 2022 $ 50 million 2.00 %\nThe weighted average interest rates on our PJI Facilities, including the impact of the int er est rate swap ag ree ments, we re\n3.8% and 4.1% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur PJI Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including the following financial covenants, as\ndefined by the PJI Credit Agreement:\nActual Ratio for the\nYear Ended\nPermitted Ratio December 27, 2020\nLeverage ratio Not to exceed 4.75 to 1.0 2.4 to 1.0\nInterest coverage ratio Not less than 2.25 to 1.0 3.8 to 1.0\nOur leverage ratio is defined as outstanding debt divided by consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization (“EBITDA”) for the most recent four fiscal quarters. Our interest coverage ratio is defined as the sum of\nconsolidated EBITDA and consolidated rental expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters divided by the sum of\nconsolidated interest expense and consolidated rental expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters. We were in\ncompliance with all financial covenants as of December 27, 2020.\n43\nTable of Contents\nPapa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”) our national marketing fund, has a $20.0 million revolving line of credit (the\n“PJMF Revolving Facility”) pursuant to a Revolving Loan Agreement, dated September 30, 2015 (as amended, the “PJMF\nLoan Agreement”) with U.S. Bank National Association, as lender. There was no balance outstanding under the PJMF\nRevolving Facility as of December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019. The PJMF operating results and the related debt\noutstanding do not impact the financial covenants under the PJI Credit Agreement.\nSee “Note 13” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\nCash Flows\nCash flow provided by operating activities was $186.4 million for 2020 as compared to $61.7 million in 2019. The increase\nof approximately $124.7 million was primarily due to higher net income and favorable working capital changes including\ntiming of payments.\nCash flow used in investing activities was $41.1 million in 2020 as compared to $32.6 million for the same period in 2019.\nThe increase in cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to proceeds from the refranchising of restaurants\nin 2019. This was somewhat offset by higher note repayments from franchisees in 2020.\nCash flow used in financing activities was $43.5 million in 2020 as compared to $34.6 million for the same period in 2019.\nThe increase in cash flow used in financing activities was primarily due to the timing of repayments on our Term Loan\nFacility, repurchases of common stock and higher dividends paid to preferred stockholders, offset by higher cash proceeds\nreceived from the exercise of stock options. In 2019, we also received $252.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of\nSeries B Preferred Stock, which was primarily used for net repayments on our Revolving Facility of $240.0 million.\nThe Company recorded dividends of approximately $43.1 million for the year ended December 27, 2020 consisting of the\nfollowing:\n• $29.4 million paid to common stockholders ($0.90 per share);\n• $4.6 million in common stock “pass-through” dividends paid to Series B Preferred Stockholders on an as-\nconverted basis ($0.90 per share); and\n• $9.1 million in preferred dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock (3.6% of the investment per annum).\nThe Company paid common stock dividends of $28.6 million, common stock “pass-through” dividends to Series B\nPreferred Stockholders of $4.3 million, and $5.7 million in preferred dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock in 2019.\nOn January 25, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.225 per share of common stock\n(approximately $7.4 million was paid to common stockholders and $1.1 million was paid as “pass through” dividends to\nholders of Series B Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis). The first quarter dividend on outstanding shares of Series\nB Preferred Stock was also declared on January 25, 2021. The common stock dividend was paid on February 19, 2021 to\nstockholders of record as of the close of business on February 8, 2021. The first quarter preferred dividend of $2.3 million\nwill be paid to holders of Series B Preferred Stock on April 1, 2021.\n44\nTable of Contents\nWe also use free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, defined as net cash provided by operating activities (from the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows) less the purchases of property and equipment and dividends paid to preferred\nstockholders. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor that management uses in determining\nthe amount of cash available for discretionary investment. Free cash flow is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result,\nour measure of free cash flow might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash\nflow should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the Company’s performance than the Company’s\nGAAP measures. See “Items Impacting Comparability; Non-GAAP Measures” for a discussion of free cash flow.

At December 27, 2020, we had an interest rate swap\nliability of $13.5 million recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2) Interest payments assume an outstanding debt balance of $350.0 million. Interest payments are calculated based on\nLIBOR plus the applicable margin in effect at December 27, 2020, and includes the impact of interest rate swap\nagreements in effect. The actual interest rates on our variable rate debt and the amount of our indebtedness could vary\nfrom those used to compute the above interest payments. See “Note 13” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements” for additional information concerning our debt and credit arrangements.\n(3) See “Note 3” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. The above amounts exclude\nfuture expected sub-lease income in the United Kingdom.\nThe above table does not include the following:\n• Unrecognized tax benefits of $1.0 million since we are not able to make reasonable estimates of the period of\ncash settlement with respect to the taxing authority.\n• Redeemable noncontrolling interests of $6.5 million as we are not able to predict the timing of the redemptions.\n• Expected minimum lease payments of approximately $33.0 million associated with our new office in Atlanta,\nGeorgia which is expected to commence in fiscal 2021.\n45\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe guarantee leases for certain Papa John’s North American franchisees who have purchased restaurants that were\npreviously Company-owned. We are contingently liable on these leases. These leases have varying terms, the latest of\nwhich expires in 2036. As of December 27, 2020, the estimated maximum amount of undiscounted payments the Company\ncould be required to make in the event of nonpayment by the primary lessees was approximately $14.3 million.\nWe have certain other commercial commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events.

Generally, the\nuse of words such as “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “will,” “forecast,” “plan,” “project,” or similar\nwords identify forward-looking statements that we intend to be included within the safe harbor protections provided by\nthe federal securities laws. Such forward-looking statements include or may relate to projections or guidance concerning\nbusiness performance, revenue, earnings, cash flow, earnings per share, share repurchases, the financial impact of the\ntemporary business opportunities, disruptions and temporary changes in demand we are experiencing related to the current\noutbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), including our cash on hand and access to our credit facilities,\ncommodity costs, currency fluctuations, profit margins, unit growth, unit level performance, capital expenditures,\nrestaurant and franchise development, the duration of changes in consumer behavior caused by the pandemic, the duration\nand number of temporary store closures, our plans to open an office in Atlanta, the associated reorganization costs and the\nrelated organizational, employment and real estate changes that are expected, royalty relief, the effectiveness of menu\ninnovations and other business initiatives, marketing efforts, liquidity, compliance with debt covenants, strategic decisions\nand actions, dividends, effective tax rates, regulatory changes and impacts, adoption of new accounting standards, and\nother financial and operational measures. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain\nrisks, uncertainties and assumptions, which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.

We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events,\nnew information or otherwise, except as required by law.\n47\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on our Revolving Facility and our Term Loan Facility, which\ncomprise the PJI Facilities. We attempt to minimize interest rate risk exposure by fixing our interest rate through the\nutilization of interest rate swaps, which are derivative financial instruments. Our swaps are entered into with financial\ninstitutions that participate in the PJI Facilities. By using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest\nrates, we expose ourselves to credit risk due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the\nderivative contract. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. See “Note\n13” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our debt obligations and derivative\ninstruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from our operations outside of the United States, which\ncan adversely impact our revenues, net income and cash flows. Our international operations principally consist of\ndistribution sales to franchised Papa John’s restaurants located in the United Kingdom and our franchise sales and support\nactivities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our\ninternational franchisees. Approximately 6.8% of our 2020 revenues, 7.8% of our 2019 revenues and 8.3% of our revenues\nfor 2018 were derived from these international operations.\nWe have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations\nhad an unfavorable impact of approximately $600,000 on our consolidated revenues in 2020 compared to an unfavorable\nimpact of $5.1 million in 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $1.0 million on our\noperating income in 2020 compared to an unfavorable impact of $1.3 million in 2019. An additional 10% adverse change\nin the foreign currency rates for our international markets would result in an additional negative impact on annual revenue\nand operating income of approximately $13.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\nCommodity Price Risk\nIn the ordinary course of business, the food and paper products we purchase, including cheese (our largest ingredient cost),\nare subject to seasonal fluctuations, weather, availability, demand and other factors that are beyond our control. We have\npricing agreements with some of our vendors, including forward pricing agreements for a portion of our cheese purchases\nfor our domestic Company-owned restaurants, which are accounted for as normal purchases; however, we still remain\nexposed to on-going commodity volatility.\nThe following table presents the actual average block price for cheese by quarter in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Also presented\nis the projected 2021 average block price by quarter (based on the February 17, 2021 Chicago Mercantile Exchange cheese\nfutures prices for 2021):\n2021 2020 2019 2018\nProjected Block Block Block\nMarket Price Price Price\nQuarter 1 $ 1.814 $ 1.857 $ 1.490 $ 1.522\nQuarter 2 1.802 1.679 1.696 1.607\nQuarter 3 1.834 2.262 1.898 1.592\nQuarter 4 1.818 2.235 1.984 1.487\nFull Year $ 1.817 $ 2.008 $ 1.767 $ 1.552\n48\nTable of Contents\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Papa John’s International, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Papa John’s International, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the\nCompany) as of December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations,\ncomprehensive income (loss), stockholders' deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December\n27, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to\nas the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company at December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, and the results of\nits operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 27, 2020, in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2020, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 Framework), and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nAdoption of ASU No. 2016-02\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases\nin 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, as amended.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period of the consolidated financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts\nor disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n49\nTable of Contents\nM easurement and valuation of reserve for franchisee notes receivable\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a\nreserve for franchisee notes receivable of $3.2 million (“Reserve for Franchisee\nNotes Receivables”) against a gross balance of franchisee notes receivables of $51.1\nmillion at December 27, 2020. The Reserve for Franchisee Notes Receivables is\nestimated to reduce the outstanding notes receivable for expected credit losses after\nconsideration of the fair value of the Company’s collateral rights (e.g., underlying\nfranchisee business, property and equipment) and any guarantees as well as a review\nof each franchisee’s economic performance, historical loss information, current\nmarket conditions, and future economic conditions.\nAuditing the valuation of the Reserve for Franchisee Notes Receivables is\nchallenging due to the judgment inherent in estimating the fair value of the\nCompany’s collateral rights, which has a significant effect on the measurement of the\nReserve for Franchisee Notes Receivables.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in We tested management’s controls related to the measurement and valuation of the\nOur Audit Reserve for Franchisee Notes Receivables. For example, we tested controls over\nmanagement’s review of the progression of outstanding notes receivable and the\nReserve for Franchisee Notes Receivable and the overall review of the adequacy of\nthe Reserve for Franchisee Notes Receivable. Where judgment was exercised by\nmanagement, our audit procedures included testing controls over management’s\nevaluation of the assumptions, including the fair value of the collateral rights and\nguarantees where collateral was taken or personal guarantee given in connection with\nissuance of the applicable note. Our control testing also considered management’s\nreview over the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in evaluating\nthe measurement and valuation of the Reserve for Franchisee Notes Receivables.\nTo test the measurement and valuation of the Reserve for Franchisee Notes\nReceivables, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the status of\ncollection of scheduled payments for outstanding notes receivables, analyzing unit\neconomics for franchisees to identify indicators of their financial health, evaluating\nthe estimates of collateral value, and the underlying data used by management. For\nexample, to evaluate the estimates of collateral value, we compared management’s\nestimates to those of recently executed market transactions to understand potential\nmarket adjustments within the estimation process.\nMeasurement and valuation of insurance reserves\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 27,\n2020, the Company has $82.0 million accrued for self-insurance reserves (“Insurance\nReserves”). The Company is self-insured for certain obligations up to stated retention\nlevels under its retention programs related to workers’ compensation, automobile,\nproperty and general liability programs and judgments and estimates are used by the\nCompany in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for\nevents that have occurred but have not been reported.\n50\nTable of Contents\nAuditing the valuation of the Insurance Reserves was highly judgmental and complex\ndue to the significant uncertainty in estimating the potential value of reported claims,\nestimating the number and potential value of incurred but not reported claims and the\nuse of actuarial valuation methods. The reserve estimate is sensitive to actuarial\nassumptions (e.g., future emergence of losses, incurred but not reported claims) used\nto estimate the ultimate liability for reported claims and to estimate the fair value of\nclaims that have been incurred but have not been reported.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in We tested controls related to the measurement and valuation of the Insurance\nOur Audit Reserves. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the\nassumptions and methods used to establish the estimate, the underlying data,\nsignificant actuarial assumptions and the related reconciliations.\nTo test the measurement and valuation of the Insurance Reserves, our audit\nprocedures included, among others, performing transactional testing over the\ncompleteness and accuracy of claims data and vouching payments made to third\nparties. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in the evaluation\nof the key assumptions and methodologies used by management to determine the\nInsurance Reserves.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor consecutively since 2019.\nLouisville, Kentucky\nFebruary 25, 2021\n51\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nPapa John’s International, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ deficit,\nand cash flows of Papa John’s International, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) for the year ended December 30, 2018,\nand the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

Statements\n1. Description of Business\nPapa John’s International, Inc. (referred to as the “Company,” “Papa John’s” or in the first person notations of “we,” “us”\nand “our”), operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants under the trademark “Papa John’s,” in 48\ncountries and territories as of December 27, 2020. Our revenues are derived from retail sales of pizza and other food and\nbeverage products to the general public by Company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties and sales of franchise and\ndevelopment rights, printing and promotional items and information systems equipment, and software and related services.\nWe generated revenues from the operation of our Quality Control Centers (“QC Centers”) which supply pizza sauce,\ndough, food products, paper products, smallwares and cleaning supplies to restaurants. We also derived revenue from\ncontributions received by our North America Marketing funds.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Papa John’s International, Inc. and its\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December of each year. All fiscal years presented consist of 52 weeks.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and accompanying notes. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include\nthe allowance for credit losses on accounts and notes receivable, intangible assets, contract assets and contract liabilities\nincluding the customer loyalty program obligation, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, gift card breakage, insurance\nreserves and tax reserves. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could significantly differ from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in contracts with customers and excludes waivers or incentives and\namounts collected on behalf of third parties, primarily sales tax. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a\nperformance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Taxes assessed by a governmental\nauthority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the\nCompany from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Delivery costs, including freight associated with our domestic\ncommissary and other sales, are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in operating costs.\nThe following describes principal activities, separated by major product or service, from which the Company generates its\nrevenues:\nDomestic Company-owned Restaurant Sales\nThe domestic Company-owned restaurants principally generate revenue from retail sales of high-quality pizza, Papadias,\nwhich are flatbread-style sandwiches, and side items including breadsticks, cheesesticks, chicken poppers and wings,\ndessert items and canned or bottled beverages. Revenues from Company-owned restaurants are recognized when the\nproducts are delivered to or carried out by customers.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOur North American customer loyalty program, Papa Rewards, is a spend-based program that rewards customers with\npoints for each purchase. Papa Rewards points are accumulated and redeemed for dollar off discounts (“Papa Dough”) to\nbe used on future purchases within a six-month expiration window. The accrued liability in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets, and corresponding reduction of Company-owned restaurant sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, is\nfor the estimated reward redemptions at domestic Company-owned restaurants based upon estimated redemption patterns.\nThe liability related to Papa Rewards is calculated using the estimated redemption value for which the points and\naccumulated rewards are expected to be redeemed. Revenue is recognized when the customer redeems the Papa Dough\nreward and when the points or Papa Dough reward expires.\nFranchise Royalties and Fees\nFranchise royalties, which are based on a percentage of franchise restaurant sales, are recognized as sales occur. Any\nroyalty reductions, including waivers or those offered as part of a new store development incentive or as incentive for\nother behaviors, including acceleration of restaurant remodels or equipment upgrades, are recognized at the same time as\nthe related royalty, as they are not separately distinguishable from the full royalty rate. Our current standard franchise\nagreement requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 5% of sales, and the majority of our existing franchised restaurants\nhave a 5% contractual royalty rate in effect. Incentives offered from time to time, including new store incentives, will\nreduce the contractual royalty rate paid. Franchise royalties are billed on a monthly basis.\nThe majority of initial franchise license fees and area development exclusivity fees are from international locations. Initial\nfranchise license fees are billed at the store opening date. Area development exclusivity fees are billed upon execution of\nthe development agreements which grant the right to develop franchised restaurants in future periods in specific geographic\nareas. Area development exclusivity fees are included in Deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and\nallocated on a pro rata basis to all stores opened under that specific development agreement. The pre-opening services\nprovided to franchisees do not contain separate and distinct performance obligations from the franchise right; thus, the\nfees collected will be amortized on a straight-line basis beginning at the store opening date through the term of the franchise\nagreement, which is typically 10 years. Franchise license renewal fees for both domestic and international locations, which\ngenerally occur every 10 years, are billed before the renewal date. Fees received for future license renewal periods are\nincluded in deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the life of the renewal period.\nThe Company offers various incentive programs for franchisees including royalty incentives, new restaurant opening\nincentives (i.e. development incentives) and other support initiatives. Royalties and franchise fees sales are reduced to\nreflect any royalty incentives earned or granted under these programs that are in the form of discounts.\nCommissary Revenues\nCommissary revenues are comprised of food and supplies sold to franchised restaurants and are recognized as revenue\nupon shipment of the related products to the franchisees. Payments are generally due within 30 days.\nAs noted above, there are various incentive programs available to franchisees related to new restaurant openings including\ndiscounts on initial commissary orders and new store equipment incentives, at substantially no cost to franchisees.\nCommissary revenues are reduced to reflect incentives in the form of direct discounts on initial commissary orders. The\nnew store equipment incentive is also recorded as a reduction of commissary sales over the term of the incentive agreement,\nwhich is generally three to five years.\nOther Revenues\nFranchise Marketing Fund revenues represent a required established percentage of monthly restaurant sales collected by\nPapa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”), which is our national marketing fund, and various other international and\ndomestic marketing funds (“Co-op” or “Co-operative” Funds) where we have determined for purposes of accounting that\nwe have control over the significant activities of the funds. PJMF funds its operations with ongoing financial support and\ncontributions from domestic Papa John’s restaurants, of which approximately 80% are franchised restaurant members.\nContributions are based on a percentage of monthly restaurant sales and are billed monthly. When we are determined to\nbe the principal in these arrangements, advertising fund contributions and expenditures are reported on a gross basis in the\n60\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. Our obligation related to these funds is to develop and conduct advertising\nactivities in a specific country, region, or market, including the placement of electronic and print materials.\nThere are no expiration dates and we do not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift cards. While the Company and\nthe franchisees continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, the likelihood of redemption may be determined to\nbe remote for certain cards due to long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, the Company recognizes breakage\nrevenue for amounts not subject to unclaimed property laws. Based upon our analysis of historical gift card redemption\npatterns, we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote. Breakage revenue is\nrecognized over time in proportion to estimated redemption patterns as Other revenues. Commissions on gift cards sold\nby third parties are recorded as a reduction to Deferred revenue and a reduction to Other revenues based upon estimated\nredemption patterns.\nFees for information services, including software maintenance fees, help desk fees, centralized call center fees, and online\nordering fees are recognized as revenue as such services are provided and are included in Other revenues.\nRevenues for printing, promotional items, and direct mail marketing services are recognized upon shipment of the related\nproducts to franchisees and other customers. Direct mail advertising discounts are also periodically offered by our\nPreferred Marketing Solutions subsidiary. Other revenues are reduced to reflect these advertising discounts.\nRental income, primarily derived from properties leased by the Company and subleased to franchisees in the United\nKingdom, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective operating lease terms.\nAdvertising and Related Costs\nDomestic Company-owned advertising and related costs of $56.7 million, $54.3 million and $60.8 million in 2020, 2019,\nand 2018, respectively, include the costs of domestic Company-owned local restaurant activities such as mail coupons,\ndoor hangers and promotional items and advertising activities administered through PJMF and various local market\ncooperative advertising funds. PJMF is responsible for developing and conducting marketing and advertising for the\ndomestic Papa John’s system. The Co-op Funds are responsible for developing and conducting advertising activities in a\nspecific market, including the placement of electronic and print materials developed by PJMF. During 2020 and 2019, the\nCompany contributed additional amounts of $15.0 million and $27.5 million, respectively, to PJMF, representing\nincremental discretionary marketing fund investments in excess of contractual Company-owned restaurant-level\ncontributions as part of our temporary financial support package to our franchisees. The marketing fund investments are\nincluded in General and administrative expenses within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nLeases\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease term for operating leases, whereas\nlease expense follows an accelerated expense recognition for finance leases. A lease term often includes option periods,\navailable at the inception of the lease. Lease expense is comprised of operating and finance lease costs, short-term lease\ncosts, and variable lease costs, which primarily include common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and insurance for the\nCompany’s real estate leases. Lease costs also include variable rent, which is primarily related to the Company’s supply\nchain tractor and trailer leases that are based on a rate per mile.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)” in the first quarter of 2019 and prior periods have not been\nrestated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for equity grants is estimated on the grant date, net of projected forfeitures, and is recognized over\nthe vesting period (graded vesting over three years). Restricted stock is valued based on the market price of the Company’s\nshares on the date of grant. Stock options are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Our specific assumptions\nfor estimating the fair value of options are included in Note 21.\n61\nTable of Contents\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less at date of purchase. These\ninvestments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\nAccounts Receivable\nSubstantially all accounts receivable is due from franchisees for purchases of food, paper products, point of sale equipment,\nprinting and promotional items, information systems and related services, marketing and royalties. Credit is extended\nbased on an evaluation of the franchisee’s financial condition and collateral is generally not required. An allowance for\ncredit losses is an estimate, even if remote, based upon historical account write-off trends, facts about the current financial\ncondition of the debtor, forecasts of future operating results based upon current trends of select operating metrics and\nmacroeconomic factors. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased.\nSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements for information regarding the adoption and related accounting impact of ASU\n2016-13, “Credit Losses”, which was effective December 30, 2019.\nNotes Receivable\nThe Company has provided financing to select domestic and international franchisees principally for use in the\nconstruction and development of their restaurants and for the purchase of restaurants from the Company or other\nfranchisees. Most notes receivable bear interest at fixed or floating rates and are generally secured by the assets of each\nrestaurant and the ownership interests in the franchise. The Company has provided long-term financing to certain\nfranchisees with royalty payment plans. We establish an allowance for credit losses for franchisee notes receivables to\nreduce the outstanding notes receivable to their net realizable values based on a review of each franchisee’s economic\nperformance and market conditions after consideration of the fair value of our underlying collateral rights (e.g., underlying\nfranchisee business, property and equipment) and any guarantees. Note balances are charged off against the allowance\nafter recovery efforts have ceased.\nInterest income recorded on franchisee loans was approximately $2.1 million in 2020, $800,000 in 2019 and $750,000 in\n2018 and is reported in Investment income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements for information regarding the adoption and related accounting impact of ASU\n2016-13, “Credit Losses”, which was effective December 30, 2019.\nInventories\nInventories, which consist of food products, paper goods and supplies, smallwares, and printing and promotional items,\nare stated at the lower of cost, determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets (generally five to ten years for restaurant, commissary and other equipment, twenty to forty years for\nbuildings and improvements, and five years for technology and communication assets). Leasehold improvements are\namortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including the first renewal\nperiod (generally five to ten years).\nDepreciation expense was $46.6 million in 2020, $45.9 million in 2019 and $45.6 million in 2018.\nDeferred Costs\nWe capitalize certain information systems development and related costs that meet established criteria. Amounts\ncapitalized, which are included in property and equipment, are amortized principally over periods not exceeding five years\n62\nTable of Contents\nupon completion of the related information systems project. Total costs capitalized were approximately $3.3 million in\n2020, $3.5 million in 2019 and $4.3 million in 2018. The unamortized information systems development costs\napproximated $10.5 million and $11.5 million as of December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, respectively.\nIntangible Assets — Goodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever we identify certain triggering events or circumstances\nthat would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such tests are\ncompleted separately with respect to the goodwill of each of our reporting units, which includes our domestic Company-\nowned restaurants, United Kingdom (“PJUK”), China, and Preferred Marketing Solutions operations. We may perform a\nqualitative assessment or move directly to the quantitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period if we believe\nthat it is more efficient or if impairment indicators exist.\nWe elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our domestic Company-owned restaurants, PJUK, China, and Preferred\nMarketing Solutions operations in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result of our qualitative analyses, we determined that\nit was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts. Subsequent\nto completing our goodwill impairment tests, no indicators of impairment were identified. See Note 12 for additional\ninformation.\nDeferred Income Tax Accounts and Tax Reserves\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\ndetermining the provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes\nincome taxes paid, currently payable or receivable and those deferred.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets\nand liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences\nreverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax attribute carryforwards (e.g., net\noperating losses, capital losses, and foreign tax credits). The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized\nin the period in which the new tax rate is enacted. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional\nbasis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to realize.\nTax authorities periodically audit the Company. We record reserves and related interest and penalties for identified\nexposures as income tax expense. We evaluate these issues and adjust for events, such as statute of limitations expirations,\ncourt rulings or audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. See Note 18 for additional\ninformation.\nInsurance Reserves\nOur insurance programs for workers’ compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability, property, and\nhealth insurance coverage provided to our employees are funded by the Company up to certain retention levels under our\nretention programs. Retention limits generally range from $1,000 to $1.0 million.\nLosses are accrued based upon undiscounted estimates of the liability for claims incurred and for events that have occurred\nbut have not been reported using certain third-party actuarial projections and our claims loss experience. The determination\nof the recorded insurance reserves is highly judgmental and complex due to the significant uncertainty in the potential\nvalue of reported claims and the number and potential value of incurred but not reported claims, the application of\nsignificant judgment in making those estimates and the use of various actuarial valuation methods. The estimated insurance\nclaims losses could be significantly affected should the frequency or ultimate cost of claims differ significantly from\nhistorical trends used to estimate the insurance reserves recorded by the Company. The Company records estimated losses\nabove retention within its reserve with a corresponding receivable for expected amounts due from insurance carriers.\n63\nTable of Contents\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. At inception and on an ongoing basis, we assess whether\neach derivative that qualifies for hedge accounting continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows\nof the hedged item. If the derivative meets the hedge criteria as defined by certain accounting standards, depending on the\nnature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of assets,\nliabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) until\nthe hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nIn 2019, we reduced the notional value of our swaps by $50.0 million as a result of paying down a substantial portion of\ndebt under our Revolving Facility using the proceeds received from the sale of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock\n(the “Series B Preferred Stock”). The termination of $50.0 million of notional swap value was not significant to our results\nof operations.\nWe recognized (loss) income of ($7.5) million (($5.8) million after tax) in 2020, ($10.8) million (($8.3) million after tax)\nin 2019, and $4.3 million ($3.2 million after tax) in 2018 in other comprehensive loss for the net change in the fair value\nof our interest rate swaps. See Note 13 for additional information on our debt and credit arrangements.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nAt December 27, 2020, the Company had four joint ventures consisting of 188 restaurants, which have noncontrolling\ninterests. Consolidated net income is required to be reported separately at amounts attributable to both the Company and\nthe noncontrolling interests. Additionally, disclosures are required to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests\nof the Company and the interests of the noncontrolling owners, including a disclosure on the face of the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations of income attributable to the noncontrolling interest holder.\nThe following summarizes the redemption feature, location and related accounting within the Consolidated Balance\nSheets for these four joint venture arrangements:\nLocation within the\nConsolidated Balance\nType of Joint Venture Arrangement Sheets Recorded Value\nJoint ventures with no redemption feature Permanent equity Carrying value\nJoint ventures with option to require the Company to purchase the noncontrolling\ninterest - not currently redeemable or redemption not probable Temporary equity Carrying value\nSee Notes 10 and 11 for additional information regarding noncontrolling interests and divestitures.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe local currency is the functional currency for each of our foreign subsidiaries. Revenues and expenses are translated\ninto U.S. dollars using monthly average exchange rates, while assets and liabilities are translated using year-end exchange\nrates and historical rates. The resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss, net of income taxes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses\non Financial Instruments,” (“ASU 2016-13”) as of December 30, 2019 (the first day of fiscal 2020) under the modified\nretrospective transition method. Topic 326 requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred losses for\nfinancial assets held. Financial instruments subject to ASU 2016-13 include trade accounts receivable, notes receivable\n64\nTable of Contents\nand interest receivable (classified as Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets) from franchisees. The impact of the\nadoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nEstimates of expected credit losses, even if remote, are based upon historical account write-off trends, facts about the\ncurrent financial condition of the debtor, forecasts of future operating results based upon current trends of select operating\nmetrics, and macroeconomic factors. Credit quality is monitored through the timing of payments compared to the\nprescribed payment terms and known facts regarding the financial condition of the franchisee or customer. Accounts and\nnotes receivable balances are charged off against the allowance for credit losses after recovery efforts have ceased.\nThe following table summarizes changes in our allowances for credit losses for accounts receivable, notes receivable and\ninterest receivable:\nAccounts Interest\n(in thousands) Receivable Notes Receivable Receivable\nBalance at December 29, 2019 $ 7,341 $ 3,572 $ 910\nCumulative effect of adoption of ASU 2016-13 912 463 —\nBalance at December 30, 2019 8,253 4,035 910\nCurrent period (credit) provision for expected credit losses (3,843) (191) 144\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance (788) (843) —\nRecoveries collected — (844) —\nTransfers — 1,054 (1,054)\nBalance at December 27, 2020 $ 3,622 $ 3,211 $ —\nReference Rate Reform – Hedging\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial\nReporting.” The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying guidance on contract modifications and\nhedge accounting related to the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative\nreference rates if certain criteria are met. This guidance was effective beginning on March 12, 2020, and the Company\nmay elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2022. The hedge accounting expedients may be\napplied, on an individual hedging relationship basis, to eligible hedge accounting relationships that existed as of the\nbeginning of the effective date of this guidance, and to new eligible hedging relationships entered into after the effective\ndate of this guidance; however, those expedients generally cannot be applied to hedging relationships for periods after\nDecember 31, 2022. The Company adopted certain optional hedge accounting expedients provided by ASU 2020-04\nduring fiscal 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial\nposition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Periods\nConvertible Instruments\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and\nDerivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments\nand Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity.” This ASU amends FASB’s guidance on convertible instruments and the\nderivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity and improves and amends the related earnings per share\n(“EPS”) guidance for both Subtopics. The ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods after December 15, 2021\nand interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance\nmay have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows have been\nreclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n65\nTable of Contents\n3. Leases\nThe Company has significant leases that include most domestic Company-owned restaurant and commissary locations.\nOther domestic leases include tractor and trailer leases used by our distribution subsidiary as well as commissary\nequipment. Additionally, the Company leases a significant number of restaurants within the United Kingdom; these\nrestaurants are then subleased to the franchisees. The Company’s leases have terms as follows:\nA verage lease term\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants Five years, plus at least one renewal\nUnited Kingdom franchise-owned restaurants 15 years\nDomestic commissary locations 10 years, plus at least one renewal\nDomestic and international tractors and trailers Five to seven years\nDomestic and international commissary and office equipment Three to five years\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception and recognizes a right-of-use asset\nand a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less but greater than one\nmonth are not recorded on the balance sheet for select asset classes. The lease liability is measured at the present value of\nfuture lease payments as of the lease commencement date, or the opening balance sheet date for leases existing at adoption\nof Topic 842 (the first day of fiscal 2019). The right-of-use asset recognized is based on the lease liability adjusted for\nprepaid and deferred rent and unamortized lease incentives. An operating lease right-of-use asset is amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term and is recognized as a single lease cost against the operating lease liability. A finance\nlease right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis, with interest costs reported separately, over the lesser of the\nuseful life of the leased asset or lease term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm and is included in Operating costs or General and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments are expensed as\nincurred.\nThe Company uses its incremental borrowing rates as the discount rate for its leases, which is equal to the rate of interest\nthe Company would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar\nterms. We have elected to use the portfolio approach in determining our incremental borrowing rate. The incremental\nborrowing rate for all existing leases as of the date of adoption of Topic 842 was based upon the remaining terms of the\nleases; the incremental borrowing rate for all new or amended leases is based upon the lease terms. The lease terms for\nall the Company’s leases include the contractually obligated period of the leases, plus any additional periods covered by\nCompany options to extend the leases that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.\nCertain leases provide that the lease payments may be increased annually based on the fixed rate terms or adjustable terms\nsuch as the Consumer Price Index. Future base rent escalations that are not contractually quantifiable as of the lease\ncommencement date are not included in our lease liability.\nThe following schedule details the total right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of\nDecember 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019 (in thousands):\nDecember 27, December 29,\nLeases Classification 2020 2019\nAssets\nFinance lease assets, net Finance lease right-of-use assets, net $ 16,840 $ 9,383\nOperating lease assets, net Operating lease right-of-use assets 148,110 148,229\nTotal lease assets $ 164,950 $ 157,612\nLiabilities\nCurrent finance lease liabilities Current finance lease liabilities $ 3,545 $ 1,789\nCurrent operating lease liabilities Current operating lease liabilities 23,538 23,226\nNoncurrent finance lease liabilities Long-term finance lease liabilities 13,531 7,629\nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities Long-term operating lease liabilities 124,666 125,297\nTotal lease liabilities $ 165,280 $ 157,941\n66\nTable of Contents\nLease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

At\nDecember 27, 2020, we leased and subleased 385 Papa John’s restaurants to franchisees in the United Kingdom. The\ninitial lease terms on the franchised sites in the United Kingdom are generally 15 years. The Company has the option to\nnegotiate an extension toward the end of the lease term at the landlord’s discretion. Rental income, primarily derived from\nproperties leased and subleased to franchisees in the United Kingdom, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nrespective operating lease terms, in accordance with Topic 842, similar to previous guidance.\n67\nTable of Contents\nLease Guarantees\nAs a result of assigning our interest in obligations under property leases as a condition of the refranchising of certain\nrestaurants, we are contingently liable for payment of approximately 80 domestic leases. These leases have varying terms,\nthe latest of which expires in 2036. As of December 27, 2020, the estimated maximum amount of undiscounted payments\nthe Company could be required to make in the event of nonpayment by the primary lessees was $14.3 million. This\ncontingent liability is not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet or future minimum lease obligation.

As of\nDecember 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, the contract assets were approximately $5.1 million and $6.0 million,\nrespectively. For the years ended December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, respectively, revenue was reduced\napproximately $3.2 million and $3.5 million for the amortization of contract assets over the applicable contract terms.\nContract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\nThe following table (in thousands) includes estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to\nperformance obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period.\nPerfo rm ance Obligation s by P eriod\nLess than 1\nYear 1-2 Years 2-3 Years 3-4 Years 4-5 Years Thereafter Total\nFranchise fees $ 2,288 $ 2,090 $ 1,822 $ 1,591 $ 1,352 $ 2,857 $ 12,000\nApproximately $1.5 million of area development fees related to unopened stores and international unearned royalties are\nincluded in Deferred revenue.

Stockholders’ Deficit\nShares Authorized and Outstanding\nThe Company has authorized 5.0 million shares of preferred stock, 100.0 million shares of common stock, and 260,000\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, net of repurchased common\nstock, were 32.5 million shares at December 27, 2020 and 31.9 million shares at December 29, 2019. There were 252,530\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of common stock under a share repurchase\nprogram that began on November 4, 2020 and is effective through December 31, 2021. In fiscal 2020, a total of 32,000\nshares with an aggregate cost of $2.7 million and an average price of $83.90 per share were repurchased under this\nprogram. Funding for the share repurchase program has been provided through our operating cash flows.\nThe Company repurchased 2.7 million shares for $158.0 million in 2018, which were funded through a credit facility,\noperating cash flow, stock option exercises, and cash and cash equivalents. There were no share repurchases during fiscal\n2019.\nSubsequent to year-end, we acquired an additional 15,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $1.3 million. Approximately\n$71.0 million remained available under the Company’s share repurchase program as of February 17, 2021.\nThe timing and volume of share repurchases may be executed at the discretion of management on an opportunistic basis,\nsubject to market and business conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors, or pursuant to trading plans or other\narrangements. Repurchases under the new program may be made through open market, block, and privately negotiated\ntransactions, including Rule 10b5-1 plans, at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. Repurchases\n70\nTable of Contents\nunder the Company’s share repurchase program may be commenced or suspended from time to time at the Company’s\ndiscretion without prior notice. Funding for the share repurchase program will be provided through our credit facility,\noperating cash flow, stock option exercises and cash and cash equivalents.\nDividends\nThe Company recorded dividends of approximately $43.1 million for the year ended December 27, 2020 consisting of the\nfollowing:\n• $29.4 million paid to common stockholders ($0.90 per share);\n• $4.6 million in common stock “pass-through” dividends paid to Series B Preferred Stockholders on an as-\nconverted basis ($0.90 per share); and\n• $9.1 million in preferred dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock (3.6% of the investment per annum).\nThe Company paid common stock dividends of $28.6 million and $29.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAdditionally, the Company paid common stock “pass-through” dividends to Series B Preferred Stockholders of $4.3\nmillion and $5.7 million in preferred dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock in 2019. There were no dividends to\nholders of Series B Preferred stock in 2018.\nOn January 25, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.225 per share of common stock\n(approximately $7.4 million was paid to common stockholders and $1.1 million was paid as “pass through” dividends to\nholders of Series B Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis). The first quarter dividend on outstanding shares of Series\nB Preferred Stock was also declared on January 25, 2021. The common stock dividend was paid on February 19, 2021 to\nstockholders of record as of the close of business on February 8, 2021. The first quarter preferred dividend of $2.3 million\nwill be paid to holders of Series B Preferred Stock on April 1, 2021.\n7. Series B Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn February 3, 2019, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”)\nwith certain funds affiliated with, or managed by, Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, “Starboard”) pursuant\nto which Starboard made a $200.0 million strategic investment in the Company’s newly designated Series B Preferred\nStock, at a purchase price of $1,000 per share. In addition, on March 28, 2019, Starboard made an additional $50.0 million\ninvestment in the Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to an option that was included in the Securities Purchase Agreement.\nThe cash proceeds from the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock to Starboard was bifurcated between the option and\npreferred stock at the time of issuance based on a relative fair value allocation approach. The Company also issued $2.5\nmillion of Series B Preferred Stock on the same terms as Starboard to certain franchisees that represented to the Company\nthat they qualify as an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.\nThe initial dividend rate on the Series B Preferred Stock is 3.6% per annum of the stated value of $1,000 per share (the\n“Stated Value”), payable quarterly in arrears. On the third anniversary of the date of issuance, each holder of Series B\nPreferred Stock will have the right to increase the dividend on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to 5.6%, and on the\nfifth anniversary of the date of issuance, each holder will have the right to increase the dividend on the shares of Series B\nPreferred Stock to 7.6%, subject in each case to the Company’s right to redeem some or all of such shares of Series B\nPreferred Stock for cash. The Series B Preferred Stock also participates on an as-converted basis in any regular or special\ndividends paid to common stockholders. If at any time, the Company reduces the regular dividend paid to common\nstockholders, the Series B Preferred Stock dividend will remain the same as if the common stock dividend had not been\nreduced.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of common stock based on\nthe conversion rate determined by dividing the Stated Value by $50.06. The Series B Preferred Stock is redeemable for\ncash at the option of either party from and after the eight-year anniversary of issuance, subject to certain conditions.\nHolders of the Series B Preferred Stock also have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to require us to repurchase all or\nany portion of the Series B Preferred Stock upon certain change of control events.\n71\nTable of Contents\nHolders of the Series B Preferred Stock have the right to vote with common stockholders on an as-converted basis on all\nmatters, without regard to limitations on conversion other than the Exchange Cap, which is equal to the issuance of greater\nthan 19.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding, and subject to certain limitations in the Certificate of\nDesignation for the Series B Preferred Stock.\nUpon consummation of a change of control of the Company, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock have the right to\nrequire the Company to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock at an amount equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (A) the\nStated Value of the Series B Preferred Stock being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid dividends and interest, and (B) the\nChange of Control As-Converted Value with respect to the Series B Preferred Shares being redeemed and (ii) the Make-\nWhole Amount (as each of these terms is defined in the Certificate of Designation).\nSince the holders have the option to redeem their shares of Series B Preferred Stock from and after the eight-year\nanniversary of issuance, which may or may not be exercised, the stock is considered contingently redeemable and,\naccordingly, is classified as temporary equity of $251.9 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 27,\n2020. This amount is reported net of $7.5 million of related issuance costs. In accordance with applicable accounting\nguidance, the Company also recorded a one-time mark-to-market temporary equity adjustment of $5.9 million in 2019 for\nthe increase in fair value for both the $50.0 million option exercised by Starboard and the shares purchased by franchisees\nfor the period of time the option was outstanding. The mark-to-market temporary equity adjustment was recorded in\nGeneral and administrative expenses for $5.6 million (Starboard) and as a reduction to North America franchise royalties\nand fees of $0.3 million (Franchisees) within the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2019 with no associated tax\nbenefit. Over the initial eight-year term, the $251.9 million investment will be accreted to the related redemption value of\napproximately $252.5 million as an adjustment to Retained Earnings.\nThe following summarizes changes to our Series B Preferred Stock (in thousands):\nBalance at December 30, 2018 $ —\nIssuance of preferred stock 252,530\nOne-time mark-to-market adjustment 5,914\nIssuance costs (7,527)\nAccretion 216\nBalance at December 29, 2019 $ 251,133\nTax deduction on issuance costs 702\nAccretion 66\nBalance at December 27, 2020 $ 251,901\n72\nTable of Contents\n8. Earnings (Loss) per Share\nWe compute earnings (loss) per share using the two-class method. The two-class method requires an earnings allocation\nformula that determines earnings (loss) per share for common shareholders and participating security holders according to\ndividends declared and participating rights in undistributed earnings. The Series B Preferred Stock and time-based\nrestricted stock awards are participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights and\nparticipate in undistributed earnings with common stock. Under the two-class method, total dividends provided to the\nholders of participating securities and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, are subtracted from net\nincome attributable to the Company in determining net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders. Additionally,\nany accretion to the redemption value for the Series B Preferred Stock is treated as a deemed dividend in the two-class\nEPS calculation.\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share are computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders\nby the weighted-average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share are computed by dividing\nthe net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding consist of basic weighted average common shares outstanding plus\nweighted average awards outstanding under our equity compensation plans, which are dilutive securities.\nThe calculations of basic earnings (loss) per common share and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for the years\nended December 27, 2020, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 are as follows (in thousands, except per share\ndata):\n2020 2019 2018\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share\nNet income attributable to the Company $ 57,932 $ 4,866 $ 2,474\nDividends paid to participating securities and accretion (14,059) (12,499) —\nNet income attributable to participating securities (2,136) — —\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 41,737 $ (7,633) $ 2,474\nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding 32,421 31,632 32,083\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share $ 1.29 $ (0.24) $ 0.08\nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 41,737 $ (7,633) $ 2,474\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 32,421 31,632 32,083\nDilutive effect of outstanding equity awards (a) 296 — 216\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding (b) 32,717 31,632 32,299\nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share $ 1.28 $ (0.24) $ 0.08\n(a) Shares subject to options to purchase common stock with an exercise price greater than the average market price for\nthe year were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because the effect would have\nbeen antidilutive. The weighted average number of shares subject to antidilutive options was 100 in 2020 and 1,200\nin 2018, respectively (none in 2019).\n(b) The Company had 252.5 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 27, 2020 and December 29,\n2019, respectively. For the fully diluted calculation, the Series B Preferred stock dividends were added back to net\nincome (loss) attributable to common shareholders. The Company then applied the if-converted method to calculate\ndilution on the Series B Preferred Stock, which resulted in 5.0 million additional common shares. This calculation\nwas anti-dilutive for both periods presented and as such was excluded.\nSee Note 21 for additional information regarding our equity awards, including restricted stock.\n73\nTable of Contents\n9. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\nThe Company is required to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the price that would be\nreceived to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability to a market participant. Fair value is a market-based measurement,\nnot an entity specific measurement. The fair value of certain assets and liabilities approximates carrying value because of\nthe short-term nature of the accounts, including cash and cash equivalents and, accounts receivable, net of credit losses,\nand accounts payable. The carrying value of our notes receivable, net of credit losses, also approximates fair value. The\nfair value of the amount outstanding under our term debt and revolving credit facility approximate their carrying values\ndue to the variable market-based interest rate (Level 2).\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are required to be classified and disclosed\nin one of the following categories:\n• Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 27, 2020 and\nDecember 29, 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nC arrying Fair V alu e Measurem en t s\nValue Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDecember 27, 2020\nFinancial assets:\nCash surrender value of life insurance policies (a) $ 37,578 $ 37,578 $ — $ —\nFinancial liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps (b) 13,452 — 13,452 —\nDecember 29, 2019\nFinancial assets:\nCash surrender value of life insurance policies (a) $ 33,220 $ 33,220 $ — $ —\nFinancial liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps (b) 6,168 — 6,168 —\n(a) Represents life insurance policies held in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan.\n(b) The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based on the sum of all future net present value cash flows. The future cash\nflows are derived based on the terms of our interest rate swaps, as well as considering published discount factors, and\nprojected London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”).\nThere were no transfers among levels within the fair value hierarchy during fiscal 2020 or 2019.\n74\nTable of Contents\n10. Noncontrolling Interests\nPapa John’s has four joint venture arrangements in which there are noncontrolling interests held by third parties. These\njoint venture arrangements include 188 restaurants and 192 restaurants at December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019\nrespectively.

Divestitures\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the refranchising of 23 Company-owned restaurants in South Florida\nfor $7.5 million in cash proceeds. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $2.9 million shown in Refranchising gains (losses),\nnet on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The PJI Facilities mature on August 30, 2022. The loans under the PJI Facilities accrue interest at a per annum\nrate equal to, at the Company’s election, either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 125 to 250 basis points or a base rate\n(generally determined by a prime rate, federal funds rate or LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus a margin ranging from 25 to 150\nbasis points. In each case, the actual margin is determined according to a ratio of the Company’s total indebtedness to\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for the then most recently ended four-quarter\nperiod (the “Leverage Ratio”). The Credit Agreement governing the PJI Facilities (the “PJI Credit Agreement”) places\ncertain customary restrictions upon the Company based on its financial covenants. These include limiting the repurchase\nof common stock and not increasing the cash dividend above the lesser of $0.225 per share per quarter or $35.0 million\nper fiscal year if the Company’s leverage ratio is above 3.75 to 1.0. Quarterly amortization payments are required to be\nmade on the Term Loan Facility in the amount of $5.0 million. Loans outstanding under the PJI Facilities may be prepaid\nat any time without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs in the case of borrowings for which a LIBOR\nrate election is in effect. Up to $35.0 million of the Revolving Facility may be advanced in certain agreed foreign\ncurrencies, including Euros, Pounds Sterling, Canadian Dollars, Japanese Yen, and Mexican Pesos.\nThe PJI Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants requiring\nthe maintenance of the Leverage Ratio and a specified fixed charge coverage ratio. The PJI Credit Agreement allows for\na permitted Leverage Ratio of 4.75 to 1.0, decreasing over time to 4.00 to 1.0 by 2022; and a fixed charge coverage ratio\nof 2.25 to 1.0, which increases to 2.50 to 1.0 in 2021 and thereafter. We were in compliance with these financial covenants\nat December 27, 2020.\nUnder the PJI Credit Agreement, we have the option to increase the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan Facility in an\naggregate amount of up to $300.0 million, subject to the Leverage Ratio of the Company not exceeding 4.00 to 1.00. The\nCompany and certain direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries are required to grant a security interest in substantially all\nof the capital stock and equity interests of their respective domestic and first tier material foreign subsidiaries to secure the\nobligations owed under the PJI Facilities.\nOur outstanding debt of $350.0 million at December 27, 2020 under the PJI Facilities was composed of $340.0 million\noutstanding under the Term Loan Facility and $10.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility. Including\noutstanding letters of credit, the Company’s remaining availability under the PJI Facilities at December 27, 2020 was\napproximately $344.2 million.\nAs of December 27, 2020, the Company had approximately $1.7 million in unamortized debt issuance costs, which are\nbeing amortized into interest expense over the term of the PJI Facilities.\nWe attempt to minimize interest rate risk exposure by fixing our rate through the utilization of interest rate swaps, which\nare derivative financial instruments. Our swaps are entered into with financial institutions that participate in the PJI Credit\nAgreement. By using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we expose ourselves to credit\nrisk due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.\nWe use interest rate swaps to hedge against the effects of potential interest rate increases on borrowings under our PJI\nFacilities.\n77\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 27, 2020, we have the following interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $350.0\nmillion:\nEffective Dates F loatin g Rate Debt Fixed Rate s\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 55 million 2.33 %\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 35 million 2.36 %\nApril 30, 2018 through April 30, 2023 $ 35 million 2.34 %\nJanuary 30, 2018 through August 30, 2022 $ 100 million 1.99 %\nJanuary 30, 2018 through August 30, 2022 $ 75 million 1.99 %\nJanuary 30, 2018 through August 30, 2022 $ 50 million 2.00 %\nThe gain or loss on the swaps is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings as\nadjustments to interest expense in the same period or periods during which the swaps affect earnings.

Papa John’s International, Inc., is a conditionally certified collective action filed in May 2016 in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that corporate restaurant delivery drivers were\nnot properly reimbursed for vehicle mileage and expenses in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act. In July 2018,\nthe District Court granted a motion to certify a conditional corporate collective class and the opt-in notice process has been\ncompleted. As of the close of the opt-in period on October 29, 2018, 9,571 drivers opted into the collective class. The\nCompany continues to deny any liability or wrongdoing in this matter and is vigorously defending this action. The\nCompany has not recorded any liability related to this lawsuit as of December 27, 2020 as it does not believe a loss is\nprobable or reasonably estimable.\nDanker v. Papa John’s International, Inc. et al. On August 30, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States\nDistrict Court, Southern District of New York on behalf of a class of investors who purchased or acquired stock in Papa\nJohn's through a period up to and including July 19, 2018. The complaint alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The District Court appointed the Oklahoma Law Enforcement\nRetirement System to lead the case. An amended complaint was filed on February 13, 2019, which the Company moved\nto dismiss. On March 16, 2020, the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss, on the ground that the complaint\nfailed to state any viable cause of action. The Plaintiffs subsequently filed a second amended complaint on April 30, 2020,\nwhich the Company moved to dismiss. The Company believes that it has valid and meritorious defenses to the second\namended complaint and intends to vigorously defend against the case. The Company has not recorded any liability related\nto this lawsuit as of December 27, 2020 as it does not believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable. Subsequent to\nDecember 27, 2020, on February 3, 2021, the Company’s motion to dismiss the case was granted with prejudice.\n21. Equity Compensation\nWe award stock options, time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units from time to time under\nthe Papa John’s International, Inc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. There are approximately 4.7 million shares of common\nstock authorized for issuance and remaining available under the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan as of December 27, 2020,\nwhich includes 5.9 million shares transferred from the Papa John’s International 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Option\nawards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. Options\noutstanding as of December 27, 2020 generally expire ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over a three-year\nperiod.\nWe recorded stock-based employee compensation expense of $16.3 million in 2020, $15.3 million in 2019 and $9.9 million\nin 2018. At December 27, 2020, there was $16.0 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards,\nof which the Company expects to recognize $10.1 million in 2021, $4.7 million in 2022 and $1.2 million in 2023.\nStock Options\nOptions exercised, which were issued from authorized shares, included 541,000 shares in 2020, 448,000 shares in 2019\nand 75,000 shares in 2018. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $13.8\nmillion, $10.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\n84\nTable of Contents\nInformation pertaining to option activity during 2020 is as follows (number of options and aggregate intrinsic value in\nthousands):\nWeighted\nAverage\nWeighted Remaining\nNumber Average Contractual Aggregate\nof Exercise Term Intrinsic\nOptions Price (In Years) Value\nOutstanding at December 29, 2019 1,205 $ 55.67\nExercised (541) 56.73\nCancelled (100) 54.70\nOutstanding at December 27, 2020 564 $ 54.82 6.58 $ 18,453\nExercisable at December 27, 2020 337 $ 59.31 5.68 $ 9,512\nThe following is a summary of the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of options granted in 2019 and\n2018 (none in 2020):\n2019 2018\nAssumptions (weighted average):\nRisk-free interest rate 2.5 % 2.7 %\nExpected dividend yield 2.1 % 1.5 %\nExpected volatility 31.2 % 27.6 %\nExpected term (in years) 5.7 5.6\nThe risk-free interest rate for the periods within the contractual life of an option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve\nin effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield was estimated as the annual dividend divided by the market\nprice of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. Expected volatility was estimated using the Company’s historical share\nprice volatility for a period similar to the expected life of the option.\nOptions granted generally vest in equal installments over three years and expire ten years after grant. The expected term\nfor these options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and was calculated using\nhistorical experience.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair values of options granted during 2019 and 2018 was $11.69 and $15.27, respectively.\nThe Company granted options to purchase 353,000 and 456,000 shares in 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were no\noptions granted in 2020.\nRestricted Stock\nWe granted shares of restricted stock that are time-based and generally vest in equal installments over three years (207,000\nin 2020, 212,000 in 2019 and 260,000 in 2018). Upon vesting, the shares are issued from treasury stock. These restricted\nshares are intended to focus participants on our long-range objectives, while at the same time serving as a retention\nmechanism. We consider time-based restricted stock awards to be participating securities because holders of such shares\nhave non-forfeitable dividend rights. We declared dividends totaling $366,000 ($0.90 per share) in 2020, $310,000 ($0.90\nper share) in 2019 and $185,000 ($0.90 per share) in 2018 to holders of time-based restricted stock.\nWe granted 15,000 and 113,000 restricted stock units that are time-based and vest over a period of one to three years in\n2020 and 2019, respectively. Upon vesting, the units are issued from treasury stock. Total dividends declared for these\nawards were insignificant to the results of our operations.\nAdditionally, we granted stock settled performance-based restricted stock units to executive management (92,000 units in\n2020, 89,000 units in 2019, and 70,000 units in 2018).\n85\nTable of Contents\nThe 2020 and 2019 performance-based restricted stock units require the achievement of certain performance and market\nfactors, which consist of the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to a predetermined peer group. The\ngrant-date fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units was determined through the use of a Monte Carlo\nsimulation model.\nThe following is a summary of the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the performance-based\nrestricted stock units granted in 2020 and 2019:\n2020 2019\nAssumptions:\nRisk-free interest rate 0.9 % 2.5 %\nExpected volatility 36.3 % 33.9 %\nThe risk-free interest rate for the periods within the contractual life of the performance-based restricted stock unit is based\non the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility was estimated using the Company’s\nhistorical share price volatility for a period similar to the expected life of the performance-based restricted stock unit.\nThe performance-based restricted stock units granted in 2020 vest over three years (cliff vest), expire ten years after grant,\nand are expensed over the performance period. The weighted average grant-date fair value of performance-based restricted\nstock units granted during 2020 and 2019 was $59.52 and $44.95, respectively.\nIn 2018, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock awards under a three-year cliff vest, and the vesting of\nthe awards is dependent upon the Company’s achievement of a compounded annual growth rate of earnings per share and\nthe achievement of certain sales and unit growth metrics. Upon vesting, the shares are issued from authorized shares.\nThe fair value of time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units is based on the market price of\nthe Company’s shares on the grant date. Information pertaining to these awards during 2020 is as follows (shares in\nthousands):\nW eighted\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nShares Fair Value\nTotal as of December 29, 2019 616 $ 50.90\nGranted 314 61.31\nForfeited (64) 52.44\nVested (199) 54.63\nTotal as of December 27, 2020 667 $ 54.33\n22. Employee Benefit Plans\nWe have established the Papa John’s International, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), as a defined contribution benefit\nplan, in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 401(k) Plan is open to employees who meet\ncertain eligibility requirements and allows participating employees to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and\ncontribute such amount to one or more investment funds. At our discretion, we may make matching contribution payments,\nwhich are subject to vesting based on an employee’s length of service with us.\nIn addition, we maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan available to certain employees and directors. Under\nthis plan, the participants may defer a certain amount of their compensation, which is credited to the participants’ accounts.\nThe participant-directed investments associated with this plan are included in Other assets ($37.6 million and $33.2 million\nat December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, respectively) and the associated liabilities ($35.8 million and $33.2 million\nat December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, respectively) are included in Other long-term liabilities in the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n86\nTable of Contents\nAt our discretion, we contributed a matching payment of 2.1% in 2020, 2.1% in 2019 and 1.5% in 2018, up to a maximum\nof 6% of a participating employee’s earnings deferred into both the 401(k) Plan and the non-qualified deferred\ncompensation plan. Such costs were $1.8 million in 2020, $1.5 million in 2019 and $1.1 million in 2018.\n23. Segment Information\nWe have four reportable segments: domestic Company-owned restaurants, North America commissaries, North America\nfranchising and international operations. The domestic Company-owned restaurant segment consists of the operations of\nall domestic (“domestic” is defined as contiguous United States) Company-owned restaurants and derives its revenues\nprincipally from retail sales of pizza, Papadias, which are flatbread-style sandwiches, and side items, including breadsticks,\ncheesesticks, chicken poppers and wings, dessert items and canned or bottled beverages. The North America commissary\nsegment consists of the operations of our regional dough production and product distribution centers and derives its\nrevenues principally from the sale and distribution of food and paper products to domestic Company-owned and franchised\nrestaurants in the United States and Canada. The North America franchising segment consists of our franchise sales and\nsupport activities and derives its revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and collection of royalties from\nour franchisees located in the United States and Canada. The international segment principally consists of distribution\nsales to franchised Papa John’s restaurants located in the United Kingdom and our franchise sales and support activities,\nwhich derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our international\nfranchisees. International franchisees are defined as all franchise operations outside of the United States and Canada. All\nother business units that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments, which are not\noperating segments, we refer to as “all others,” which consists of operations that derive revenues from the sale, principally\nto Company-owned and franchised restaurants, of printing and promotional items, franchise contributions to marketing\nfunds and information systems and related services used in restaurant operations, including our point-of-sale system, online\nand other technology-based ordering platforms.\nCertain administrative and capital costs are allocated to segments based upon predetermined rates or actual estimated\nresource usage. We account for intercompany sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties and\neliminate the activity in consolidation.\nOur reportable segments are business units that provide different products or services. Separate management of each\nsegment is required because each business unit is subject to different operational issues and strategies. No single external\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our segment profit measure to operating income from income before income\ntaxes. This change in the segment profit measure eliminated interest expense, the majority of which impacted unallocated\ncorporate expenses. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change.\n87\nTable of Contents\nOur segment information is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nRevenues: (Note) (Note)\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants $ 700,757 $ 652,053 $ 692,380\nNorth America franchising 96,732 71,828 79,293\nNorth America commissaries 680,793 612,652 609,866\nInternational 150,939 126,077 131,268\nAll others 184,013 156,638 150,064\nTotal revenues $ 1,813,234 $ 1,619,248 $ 1,662,871\nIntersegment revenues:\nNorth America franchising $ 3,229 $ 2,782 $ 2,965\nNorth America commissaries 192,332 187,073 201,325\nInternational — 191 283\nAll others 83,635 88,286 72,066\nTotal intersegment revenues $ 279,196 $ 278,332 $ 276,639\nDepreciation and amortization:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants $ 11,905 $ 12,883 $ 15,411\nNorth America commissaries 9,660 8,131 7,397\nInternational 1,975 1,722 1,696\nAll others 10,254 10,738 8,513\nUnallocated corporate expenses 15,911 13,807 13,386\nTotal depreciation and amortization $ 49,705 $ 47,281 $ 46,403\nOperating income:\nDomestic Company-owned restaurants (1) $ 37,049 $ 33,957 $ 18,988\nNorth America franchising 89,801 64,362 70,732\nNorth America commissaries 33,185 30,690 27,961\nInternational (2) 24,034 18,738 14,203\nAll others 7,043 (1,966) (5,716)\nUnallocated corporate expenses (3) (100,069) (120,280) (93,610)\nElimination of intersegment (profits) (790) (966) (1,005)\nTotal operating income $ 90,253 $ 24,535 $ 31,553\n(Note) During the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our segment profit measure to operating income.

Our internal control system is designed to provide\nreasonable assurance to our management and the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of\npublished financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.\nTherefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial\nstatement preparation and presentation.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal\nControl — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway\nCommission (“2013 Framework”). Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 Framework, our management\nconcluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 27, 2020.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the 2020 Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of its audit, has issued an attestation report, included\nherein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 27, 2020 that\nhave materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n92\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Papa John’s International, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Papa John’s International, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December\n27, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria).

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained\nin all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed\nrisk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nand that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nLouisville, Kentucky\nFebruary 25, 2021\n93\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.
