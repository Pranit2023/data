(Nasdaq: PYPD) (“PolyPid” or the “Company”), a late-stage biopharma company aiming to improve surgical outcomes, today provided a corporate update and reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights:**\n\n  * Over 540 patients have been enrolled to date in the ongoing SHIELD II Phase 3 trial of D-PLEX100 for the prevention of abdominal colorectal surgical site infections (SSIs). \n    * Recently enrolled the last patient required (430 subjects) to conduct the planned unblinded interim analysis, which will occur during the current quarter, now that the 30-day follow-up assessment for the last patient has been completed. The unblinded interim analysis will lead to one of the following outcomes: early trial conclusion due to positive efficacy, continuation to planned patient recruitment (up to 630 subjects), sample size re-assessment, or futility.\n    * Approximately 60 centers are currently open in multiple countries, including in Eastern Europe, the U.S., Germany, Ireland, Portugal and Israel.\n    * Enrollment completion of up to 630 patients is expected in December 2024 and top-line results anticipated in the first quarter of 2025.\n  * Results from the Phase 3 SHIELD I trial, one of the largest Phase 3 studies in the prevention of SSIs in colorectal resection conducted in over a decade _,_ were published in the _International Journal of Surgery_ ; manuscript available [here](https://journals.lww.com/international-journal-of-surgery/fulltext/2024/10000/effect_of_local_prolonged_release_incisional.59.aspx). Key results: \n    * A statistically significant reduction of the primary endpoint (a composite of incisional SSI, incisional reinterventions due to poor wound healing, or all-cause mortality) was observed in D-PLEX100 treated patients in a pre-specified analysis of the subpopulation with large surgical incisions (greater than 20 cm; p=0.0032).\n    * Analysis of the key secondary efficacy outcome, incisional SSI, also indicated a 54.6% reduction in the large surgical incision subgroup (4.4% in D-PLEX100 vs. 9.7% in standard of care (SoC), p= 0.0410).\n    * Based on the statistically significant reduction of the primary endpoint in the prespecified subgroup demonstrated in SHIELD I, and following the FDA guidance, the ongoing Phase 3 SHIELD II study focuses on patients with large surgical incisions. \n\n\n\n“We are very encouraged by the recent significant acceleration in patient enrollment due to the opening of all 60 planned centers in the study and the increase in the volume of surgical procedures following the conclusion of the slower summer months,” stated Dikla Czaczkes Akselbrad, PolyPid’s Chief Executive Officer. “With more than 540 patients enrolled to date in SHIELD II, we look forward to the upcoming interim analysis later this quarter. Importantly, we are funded beyond this key data catalyst and, if all the warrants issued in both of our most recent private placement financings are exercised, we would be funded into 2026.”\n\n**Financial results for three months ended****September 30****, 202****4**\n\n  * Research and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $6.0 million, compared to $3.8 million in the same three-month period of 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was driven by the ramp up in patient enrollment in the SHIELD II Phase 3 trial.\n  * General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $1.2 million, similar to the same period of 2023.\n  * Marketing and business development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $0.2 million, compared to $0.3 million for the same period of 2023.\n  * For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of $7.8 million, or ($1.22) per share, compared to a net loss of $5.6 million, or ($3.40) per share, in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n**Financial results for****nine****months ended****September 30****,****202****4**\n\n  * R&D expenses, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $15.8 million, compared to $11.6 million for the same nine-month period of 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was driven by the ramp up in patient enrollment in the SHIELD II Phase 3 trial.\n  * G&A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $3.3 million, compared to $4.3 million for the same period of 2023.\n  * Marketing and business development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $0.7 million, compared to $1.0 million for the same period of 2023.\n  * The decreases in G&A and marketing and business development expenses were primarily due to the Company’s ongoing cost savings initiatives. \n  * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of $20.5 million, or ($3.82) per share, compared to a net loss of $17.5 million, or ($13.59) per share, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet Highlights**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term deposits in the amount of $9.5 million, compared to $5.3 million on December 31, 2023. PolyPid expects that its current cash balance will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2025. If all warrants issued in both of the Company’s most recent private placement financings are exercised, the Company would be funded into 2026.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Dial-In & Webcast Information:**\n\nDate:  | Wednesday, November 13, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime: | 8:30 AM Eastern Time  \nConference Call: | <https://register.vevent.com/register/BI198de55d5c06495994d35cbb213655eb>  \nWebcast: | <https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/j6bnvt8c>  \n  \n**About SHIELD II**\n\nSHIELD II (Surgical site Hospital acquired Infection prEvention with Local D-PLEX) is a prospective, multinational, randomized, double blind Phase 3 trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of D-PLEX100 administered concomitantly with standard of care (“SoC”), which includes prophylactic systemic antibiotics, compared to SoC alone arm, in the prevention of post abdominal-surgery incisional infection in patients undergoing abdominal colorectal surgeries with large incisions. The primary endpoint of the trial is measured by the proportion of subjects with either a surgical site infection (“SSI”) event as determined by a blinded and independent adjudication committee, reintervention, or mortality for any reason within 30 days post-surgery. Patient safety will be monitored for an additional 30 days. The trial will enroll patients in centers in the United States, Europe and Israel.\n\n**About D-PLEX** 100\n\nD-PLEX100, PolyPid’s lead product candidate, is designed to provide local prolonged and controlled anti-bacterial activity directly at the surgical site to prevent SSIs. Following the administration of D-PLEX100 into the surgical site, the PLEX (Polymer-Lipid Encapsulation matriX) technology pairs with Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, enabling a prolonged and continuous release of the broad-spectrum antibiotic doxycycline, resulting in a high local concentration of the drug for a period of 30 days for the prevention of SSIs, with additional potential to prevent SSIs caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria at the surgical site. D-PLEX100 received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of SSIs in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. D-PLEX100 is currently in Phase 3 SHIELD II trial for the prevention of surgical site infections in patients undergoing abdominal colorectal surgery with large incisions.\n\n**About PolyPid**\n\n[PolyPid Ltd.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=En7Dxg8DXKWNzWpN9j7LXjI7noJ1cJF1NkShYSIY-EeG07q9PZgRYzBos7Rc8NtIFzEXUh-4CO9NuFDj7K1HFcwRq8tiNayTrBOtGkj-rmbcu_ryPLpOx9Aha-C_ugGcAanhxfSxgq2DrPJeiSidtBWQ9-i0Ikj458pMbqEDfs2E8TZz7wkkv4RCq43Ma6CDIHg0X07obwVNELCsW5WSbKjU_EQk43bIks3azWber6nf50IHPsprlNPts4cUiJmMhjm1grbOFNR3xd79mFYMzuqlg3ATRiLGstafp00bEsH5XvduE6SPfmW0_GGgP6O4kYDiuW8CKKM1UWbbmh7B9eZaZPi_dfZe8tqiGAzajfYBclO_EtmO72DfTIqC8tPbApIr9AGG52sU15SFGFTBsoncbww9HY1kvR_cWlJaG1-UNYo46qt1JXT11tqqoM-zaiOPEbFFXOhA9nhtlYttYGyMpoDfuaj-9BHFxIYOep7PMd3dyYsBYyyGXwOw591mc3J_Km4KrlN-QHFTkmz3AA0zmH4ADyTPaP_gNBfqgaykyO_zHhq-jRZmmsxQsuPTffHSWKiQ-VIPyiAgQCzeAfi319LXoU_duOnhkf15XscXqzEXu_RUnuC2ykxGDLm5hFzr8vtpNe3GjPIG_OnU8t3qzwsR_oDbQXqqvEIN-NNlqBvWS0v3pI1bVY1KgyfrfNnDDrhUX_4wm-r5rHluAjvDlPJRMyVXo_p31IZ9dE3lD_Y8yHyhhZvnc7s5rLozJuaK_4Ykk8P5PA9THQ21tInVUxCZqFfpYPf5dJy96nMpLoLj6Al0WEzOJh4LdASctK1ZiVkgE9f2YgCKsI78qhpwUOqgCdSRpLGLoAiBjQOnaek68PoKn1q5EeMe4Ae9t55HRY7NgMV-eqTmklhi7xQ1uKYhAFfgJcCfv-p0TFIMp0IU5_6beZ6KzvGZLEn0GvRNufMYFYEgJVwnr7zQdQaowAIf9m1lwlHCTAolyZWdzKkLrgvt97DLLjwL38mo) (Nasdaq: [PYPD](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MZqk08NiGyYCaxFibfv_CknAh8gZAtHXz34yy0CbxApCI78LPFpKVhjD2UXRTdm7GM_zP9aC8K1qpuwp3Wt0MiLHvfUSin23Z3-gPxJY7tEOmBGPPbhS-ifN2dDUM3OEFUoQl0sAK90teskNX1majUQx3TMhZRAEatpk-nxJV_vbS5FduL71jANTjT614kitDBRbidzpsPYuHZAFfepL1GeQ6plYMQWY57GkbuTqLW7IIq2xcfgkJZbQAAArNnkdfJo4r3cLU1D_JQPFNdDPng1pzn-qtLIDo5Kde-UQilNKg5jv48k1yh3p3KGZ4L4lORiTLXs8-N_sMkGBatos11WXMMhKBwXhca_-0oabYRch3wtRRwUQua2OoLfq_jt-JzprR9Glc7rDtnX1mvWnnsTPRNtZgRdr4Fw08QpPtbbvD3qN0bwnzb13yDpMG9T0DtB5r-hQ0B6FaDMZ425rtcWpKGZaw-r94tXACXr9SYEKFc9_VPULQfnxbCDd5Ew2Q-kaSxWk3EXySNTJBIjLewyhKtcL4dFmdCGlp045ATZ5jYKp42EbQxjbbC_tU9NI14wPsLUCmJudcCmOkGnsF1lFQeIQP1D6r42W0WSc4brmh3y-igNUrtFXguro_aJBMy8-aS8uw8yV59wWWGnPKRWojvHOJjgOohzDLGEi0-HvhTf6E3G9DnIy1GYXBAaSX9iRbFvOoMFcR6sC8WI0rG9zEEHjskl1SqkTX8S_y3qIpQct373juzpw_G0c3xoUXaFH0ExWBI3RnEkiNjZr7YUqejpoX8yCc6DgfPaX_sp58rLJJx8qBpm3_d5kF7DjcIR2SB5M0g6KtfRlFUMQceQBiGz3vVnZjTYfzjvNI3Soez5O9KllwADedRDVvjBglVuAayurzf1k9pbSFBrn_3lR1Un2Kz_8sglCMO5XXy9Xf3H1WXfsFnkqPbJ9Q8cHPG6eTpKVzlic2JwXN_nRQAGiZ0-k2Ues6s2SJZ1cKvLGyMf4ggVk87V4WXRE0ypSPFuY3zBw8TPQWZRvi53LgQ==)) is a late-stage biopharma company aiming to improve surgical outcomes.
