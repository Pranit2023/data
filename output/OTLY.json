The Company now expects: \n    * Constant currency revenue growth near, or slightly below, the low end of the previously-provided range of 6% to 10%,\n    * Adjusted EBITDA near the favorable end of its previously-provided range of $(35) million to $(50) million, and\n    * Capital expenditures below $55 million, compared to the prior expectation of below $70 million.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nRevenue increased $20.4 million, or 10.9% to $208.0 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $187.6 million for the prior year period. Excluding a foreign currency exchange tailwind of $2.5 million, revenue for the third quarter was $205.5 million, or an increase of 9.6% compared to the prior year period. The growth in constant currency revenue was primarily driven by solid volume growth in each operating segment. Sold volume for the third quarter of 2024 increased 13.0% to 141.3 million liters compared to 125.0 million liters in the third quarter of 2023. Produced finished goods volume for the third quarter of 2024 was 148.0 million liters compared to 118.8 million liters for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company continued to drive revenue growth in both the retail channel and foodservice channel in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit was $62.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $32.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit margin was 29.8% in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 1,240 basis points compared to the prior year period. The margin improvement compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by improvements in supply chain efficiency across all segments, especially in the North America and Greater China segments, as well as improvements in product mix in the Greater China segment due to the strategic reset implemented in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses in the third quarter of 2024 increased $6.2 million to $10.9 million compared to $4.7 million in the prior year period. The increase was mainly driven by expenses related to the previously communicated new product launch in the North America segment.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 decreased $7.4 million to $79.7 million compared to $87.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the various cost restructuring activities implemented since early 2023, including $3.9 million reduction in employee-related expenses, which were partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds.\n\nOther operating income and (expenses), net for the third quarter of 2024 was an expense of $0.4 million compared to an expense of $8.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the settlement of US securities class action lawsuits in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFinance income and (expenses), net for the third quarter of 2024 was an expense of $4.3 million comprised primarily of net interest expenses of $13.3 million, offset by fair value gains on Convertible Notes of $5.3 million and net foreign exchange gains of $4.5 million. The finance income and (expenses), net for the prior year period was an income of $112.8 million. The decrease was mainly driven by $121.2 million in lower fair value gains on Convertible Notes.\n\nNet loss attributable to shareholders of the parent was $34.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a profit of $44.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily a result of decreased finance income and (expenses), net, offset by improved operating loss.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.0 million, compared to a loss of $36.0 million in the prior year period. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA loss was primarily a result of higher gross profit and lower selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n_EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA loss, and Constant Currency Revenue are non-IFRS financial measures defined under “Non-IFRS financial measures”. Please see above revenue at constant currency table and “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Financial measures” at the end of this press release._\n\nThe following tables set forth revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA and (loss)/profit before tax for the Company’s three reportable segments for the periods presented.\n\n**Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA**\n\nSegment information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 presented below has been updated to reflect previously disclosed changes to our operating segments, which were effective as of January 1, 2024.

revenue for sales of products from Europe & International to Greater China.  \n(1)| Relates primarily to severance payments as the Group continues to adjust its organizational structure to the macro environment.  \n(2)| Expenses related to a new product launch issue.  \n(3)| Relates to US securities class action litigation settlement expenses.  \n(4)| Relates primarily to non-cash impairments related to discontinued construction of the Group’s production facility in Peterborough, UK, and reversal of previously recognized non-cash impairments related to discontinued construction of the Group’s production facility in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas.  \n(5)| Relates to the Ya YA Foods USA LLC transaction (the “YYF Transaction”). See the Company’s Forms 6-K filed on January 3, 2023 and March 2, 2023 for further details.  \n  \n**Europe & International**\n\nEurope & International revenue increased $6.3 million, or 6.1%, to $109.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $103.5 million in the prior year period. Excluding a foreign currency exchange tailwind of $2.1 million, Europe & International revenue for the third quarter was $107.7 million, or an increase of 4.0%. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by volume growth from increased Barista and ambient oatmilk sales in established markets, as well as continued expansion in the new European markets. Approximately 82% of Europe & International revenue was from the retail channel for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The sold finished goods volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to 77.2 and 73.2 million liters, respectively.\n\nEurope & International Adjusted EBITDA increased $3.9 million to $12.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $8.5 million in the prior year period. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by higher gross profit, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses due to increased brand building investments during the quarter.\n\n**North America**\n\nNorth America revenue increased $10.6 million, or 18.1%, to $69.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $58.5 million in the prior year period. The sold finished goods volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to 39.5 million and 33.6 million liters, respectively. The 17.6% volume increase was due to higher volumes across the retail and foodservice channels as the Company continued to expand distribution and launch new products. Approximately 52% of North America revenue was from the retail channel in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 53% in the prior year period.\n\nNorth America Adjusted EBITDA improved $11.3 million to $3.3 million compared to a loss of $8.0 million in the prior year period. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher gross profit and lower selling, general and administrative expenses through stronger cost control to drive profitability.\n\n**Greater China**\n\nGreater China revenue increased $3.5 million, or 13.7%, to $29.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $25.6 million in the prior year period. Excluding a foreign currency exchange tailwind of $0.3 million, Greater China revenue for the third quarter was $28.7 million, or an increase of 12.4%. The Greater China segment growth was primarily driven by sales to a new foodservice customer. Approximately 72% of Greater China revenue was from the foodservice channel for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 68% in the prior year period. The sold finished goods volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to 24.6 million and 18.1 million liters, respectively.\n\nGreater China Adjusted EBITDA improved $18.1 million to $1.6 million compared to a loss of $16.5 million in the prior year period. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher gross profit and reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, as the segment executed on its previously-communicated strategic reset.\n\n**Corporate**\n\nOatly’s corporate expense, which consists of general costs not allocated to the segments, in the third quarter of 2024 was $25.1 million, a decrease of $8.6 million compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2024 was a loss of $22.4 million compared to a loss of $20.0 million in the prior year period. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss was primarily driven by the addition of global branding and advertising expenses as well as foreign exchange headwinds, which were partially offset by reductions in personnel-related expenses.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flows**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $119.3 million and total outstanding debt of $441.3 million consisting of Convertible Notes and liabilities to credit institutions. Net cash used in operating activities was $104.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $151.5 million during the prior year period, which was primarily driven by improved operating results, partly offset by cash outflow of $26.3 million related to discontinued construction of the Group’s production facilities in Peterborough, UK and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and a cash outflow of $9.3 million related to the settlement of US securities class action litigation.\n\nCapital expenditures were $28.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $52.0 million in the prior year period and, in addition, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment was $24.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nFree cash flow was an outflow of $133.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an outflow of $203.5 million during the prior year period. The improvement in free cash flow was driven both by decreased net cash flows used in operating activities and lower capital expenditures, partly offset by the above-mentioned cash outflows relating to discontinued construction of the Group’s production facilities in Peterborough, UK and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas and settlement of the US securities class action litigation.\n\n_Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS liquidity measure defined under “Non-IFRS financial measures.” Please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Financial measures” at the end of this press release._\n\n**Outlook** Based on the Company’s assessment of the current operating environment and the actions it is taking, the Company is refining its full year 2024 outlook. The Company now expects:\n\n  * Constant currency revenue growth near, or slightly below, the low end of the previously-provided range of 6% to 10%,\n  * Adjusted EBITDA near the favorable end of its previously-provided range of $(35) million to $(50) million, and\n  * Capital expenditures below $55 million, compared to the prior expectation of below $70 million.\n\n\n\nThis outlook is provided in the context of significant macroeconomic uncertainty and other geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nThe Company cannot provide a reconciliation of constant currency revenue growth or Adjusted EBITDA guidance to the nearest comparable corresponding IFRS metric without unreasonable efforts due to difficulty in predicting certain items excluded from these non-IFRS measures. The items necessary to reconcile are not within Oatly’s control, may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.\n\n**Conference Call, Webcast and Supplemental Presentation Details**\n\nOatly will host a conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. ET today to discuss these results. The conference call, simultaneous, live webcast and supplemental presentation can be accessed on Oatly’s Investors website at https://investors.oatly.com under “Events.” The webcast will be archived for 30 days.\n\n**About Oatly**\n\nWe are the world’s original and largest oat drink company.

Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date hereof and accordingly undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Oatly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this press release, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than to the extent required by applicable law.\n\n**Non-IFRS Financial Measures** We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Revenue as non-IFRS financial measures in assessing our operating performance and Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure, and each in our financial communications:\n\n“EBITDA” is defined as (loss)/profit for the period adjusted to exclude, when applicable, income tax expense, finance expenses, finance income and depreciation and amortization expense.\n\n“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as (loss)/profit for the period adjusted to exclude, when applicable, income tax expense, finance expenses, finance income, depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, restructuring costs, expenses related to a new product launch issue, costs related to legal settlement, impacts related to discontinued construction of production facilities, costs related to the YYF Transaction, and non-controlling interests.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to (loss)/profit for the period or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than (loss)/profit for the period, which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure. Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future increasing our cash requirements;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash required to service our debt, which reduces cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax payments that reduce cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect recurring share-based compensation expense and, therefore, does not include all of our compensation costs;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect restructuring costs that reduce cash available to us in future periods;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect expenses related to a new product launch issue that reduce cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect costs related to legal settlement that reduce cash available to us in future periods;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA excludes impacts related to discontinued construction of production facilities, although some of these may reduce cash available to us in future periods;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect costs related to the YYF Transaction that reduced cash available to us;\n  * Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with IFRS. Below we have provided a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to (loss)/profit for the period, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, for the periods presented.\n\n“Constant Currency Revenue” is calculated by translating the current year reported revenue amounts into comparable amounts using the prior year reporting period’s average foreign exchange rates which have been provided by a third party. Constant Currency Revenue is a non-IFRS measure and is not a substitute for IFRS measures in assessing our overall financial performance.\n\nConstant currency revenue is used to provide a framework in assessing how our business and geographic segments performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons and better identify trends in our business. Above we have provided a reconciliation of revenue as reported to revenue on a constant currency basis for the periods presented.\n\n“Free Cash Flow” is defined as net cash flows used in operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities.\n\nFree Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not a substitute for IFRS measures in assessing our overall financial liquidity. Because Free Cash Flow is not a measurement determined in accordance with IFRS, and is susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported on our interim condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document. Below we have provided a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash flows used in operating activities for the periods presented.\n\n**Financial Statements**\n\n**Interim condensed consolidated

In the second quarter, we grew volumes in every segment, continued to structurally reduce our cost structure, and continued to invest to further strengthen our brand. Overall, we are making good progress on the three strategic pillars that we are focusing on in 2024: to bring the Oatly magic to more people, to continue our work on the calibration of resources, and to focus on execution.”\n\nFlatin added, “Given our solid performance through the first half of the fiscal year, and an increased confidence in our second-half outlook, we are updating our full-year guidance to be more favorable than our prior outlook. In the second half of the year, our priorities will be completing our work on the calibration of resources, investing in high-return demand generating investments, and maintaining our north star target to drive the business toward structural, consistent profitable growth.”\n\nThe tables below reconcile revenue as reported to revenue on a constant currency basis by segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Three months ended June 30,**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Asreported**| **Foreign exchange impact**| **Inconstant currency**| **Asreported**| **Inconstant currency**| **Volume**| **Constant currency price/mix**  \nEurope & International| 105,541| 98,768| 105,541| (615| )| 106,156| 6.9| %| 7.5| %| 5.7| %| 1.8| %  \nNorth America| 67,819| 61,832| 67,819| —| 67,819| 9.7| %| 9.7| %| 8.3| %| 1.4| %  \nGreater China| 28,835| 35,387| 28,835| (915| )| 29,750| -18.5| %| -15.9| %| 26.3| %| -42.2| %  \n**Total revenue**| **202,195**| **195,987**| **202,195**| **(1,530**| **)**| **203,725**| **3.2**| **%**| **3.9**| **%**| **9.6**| **%**| **-5.7**| **%**  \n**Six months ended June 30,**| **$ Change**| **% Change**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Asreported**| **Foreign exchange impact**| **Inconstant currency**| **Asreported**| **Inconstant currency**| **Volume**| **Constant currency price/mix**  \nEurope & International| 215,948| 199,264| 215,948| 1,564| 214,384| 8.4| %| 7.6| %| 4.9| %| 2.7| %  \nNorth America| 134,786| 125,873| 134,786| —| 134,786| 7.1| %| 7.1| %| 9.9| %| -2.8| %  \nGreater China| 50,616| 66,495| 50,616| (1,951| )| 52,567| -23.9| %| -20.9| %| 5.3| %| -26.2| %  \n**Total revenue**| **401,350**| **391,632**| **401,350**| **(387**| **)**| **401,737**| **2.5**| **%**| **2.6**| **%**| **6.3**| **%**| **-3.7**| **%**  \n  \n**Highlights**\n\n  * Second quarter revenue of $202.2 million, a 3.2% increase compared to the prior year period, and constant currency revenue increased 3.9% compared to the prior year period, with solid volume growth in each operating segment.\n  * Gross margin in the second quarter was 29.2%, which is a 10.0 percentage points increase compared to the prior year period.\n  * Second quarter net loss attributable to shareholders of the parent was $30.4 million, which is an improvement of $56.3 million compared to net loss attributable to shareholders of the parent of $86.7 million in the prior year period.\n  * Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA loss was $11.0 million, which is an improvement of $41.5 million compared to the prior year period.\n  * The North America segment reported its first full quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA.\n  * The Company is raising its full year 2024 outlook for constant currency revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA while lowering its guidance for capital expenditures. The Company now expects: \n    * Constant currency revenue growth in the range of 6% to 10%, compared to the prior expectation of 5% to 10%,\n    * Adjusted EBITDA loss in the range of $(35) million to $(50) million, compared to the prior expectation of range of $(35) million to $(60) million, and\n    * Capital expenditures below $70 million, compared to the prior expectation of below $75 million.\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nRevenue increased $6.2 million, or 3.2% to $202.2 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $196.0 million for the prior year period. Excluding a foreign currency exchange headwind of $1.5 million, revenue for the second quarter was $203.7 million, or an increase of 3.9% compared to the prior year period. The growth in constant currency revenue was primarily driven by the Europe & International and North America segments, partially offset by expected declines in the Greater China segment due to the strategic reset implemented in the third quarter 2023. Sold volume for the second quarter of 2024 increased 9.6% to 137 million liters compared to 125 million liters in the second quarter of 2023. Produced finished goods volume for the second quarter of 2024 was 142 million liters compared to 130 million liters for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company drove revenue growth in both the retail channel and foodservice channel in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit was $59.0 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $37.7 million for the second quarter of 2023. Gross profit margin was 29.2% in the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 1,000 basis points compared to the prior year period. The margin improvement compared to the second quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by improvements in supply chain efficiency in the North America and Greater China segments as well as improvements in product mix in the Greater China segment due to the strategic reset implemented in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses in the second quarter of 2024 increased $5.6 million to $10.9 million compared to $5.3 million in the prior year period. The increase was mainly driven by expenses related to a new product launch in the North America segment after the Company determined the product was not up to its standards.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2024 decreased $22.4 million to $84.3 million compared to $106.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the various cost restructuring activities implemented since early 2023, including $6.6 million reduction in employee-related expenses, $4.7 million reduction in branding, advertising and marketing expenses, $4.3 million reduction in external consultant, legal contractor and other professional fees, and a $1.7 million reduction in corporate insurance expenses.\n\nOther operating income and (expenses), net for the second quarter of 2024 was an expense of $2.9 million compared to an expense of $1.1 million in the prior year period, comprised primarily of $2.9 million in non-cash impairment charges related to the Group’s discontinued construction of its production facility in Peterborough, UK.\n\nFinance income and (expenses), net for the second quarter of 2024 was an income of $10.4 million comprised primarily of fair value gains on Convertible Notes of $23.9 million, offset by net interest expenses of $13.0 million. The finance income and (expenses), net for the prior year period was an expense of $11.5 million. The improvement was mainly driven by $20.1 million in increased fair value gains on Convertible Notes.\n\nNet loss attributable to shareholders of the parent was $30.4 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $86.7 million in the prior year period. The improvement in net loss was primarily a result of higher gross profit and lower selling, general and administrative expenses across all segments, and an improvement in finance income and (expenses), net.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $11.0 million, compared to a loss of $52.5 million in the prior year period. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA loss was primarily a result of higher gross profit and lower selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n_EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA loss, and Constant Currency Revenue are non-IFRS financial measures defined under “Non-IFRS financial measures”. Please see above revenue at constant currency table and “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Financial measures” at the end of this press release._\n\nThe following tables set forth revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA and loss before tax for the Company’s three reportable segments for the periods presented.\n\n**Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA**\n\nSegment information for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 presented below has been updated to reflect previously disclosed changes to our operating segments, which were effective as of January 1, 2024.

general overhead costs not allocated to the segments.** Eliminations in 2024 and 2023 primarily refer to intersegment revenue for sales of products from Europe & International to Greater China.\n\n(1)| Relates primarily to severance payments as the Group continues to adjust its organizational structure to the macro environment.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Relates primarily to non-cash impairments related to discontinued construction of the Group’s production facility in Peterborough, UK, and reversal of previously recognized non-cash impairments related to discontinued construction of the Group’s production facility in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas.  \n(3)| Expenses related to a new product launch issue.  \n(4)| Relates to the Ya YA Foods USA LLC transaction (the “YYF Transaction”). See the Company’s Forms 6-K filed on January 3, 2023 and March 2, 2023 for further details.  \n  \n**Europe & International**\n\nEurope & International revenue increased $6.8 million, or 6.9%, to $105.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $98.8 million in the prior year period. Excluding a foreign currency exchange headwind of $0.6 million, Europe & International revenue for the second quarter was $106.2 million, or an increase of 7.5%. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by volume growth, and also benefited from price increases introduced during the first part of 2023. Approximately 80% of Europe & International revenue was from the retail channel for the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The sold finished goods volume for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to 74 and 70 million liters, respectively.\n\nEurope & International Adjusted EBITDA increased $11.3 million to $12.6 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $1.3 million in the prior year period. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by higher gross profit, and reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n**North America**\n\nNorth America revenue increased $6.0 million, or 9.7%, to $67.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $61.8 million in the prior year period. The sold finished goods volume for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to 39 million and 36 million liters, respectively. The 8.3% volume increase was due to higher volumes across the retail and foodservice channels as the Company continued to expand distribution and launch new products. Approximately 52% of North America revenue was from the retail channel in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 51% in the prior year period.\n\nNorth America Adjusted EBITDA improved $12.0 million to $1.2 million compared to a loss of $10.9 million in the prior year period. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher gross profit and lower selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from the cost saving initiatives implemented during 2023.\n\n**Greater China**\n\nGreater China revenue decreased $6.6 million, or 18.5%, to $28.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $35.4 million in the prior year period. Excluding a foreign currency exchange headwind of $0.9 million, Greater China revenue for the second quarter was $29.8 million, or a decrease of 15.9%. The Greater China segment decline was primarily driven by the prior decision to refocus into the foodservice channel, resulting in discontinuation of certain lower-margin products and customers across the retail and e-commerce channels. These declines were partially offset by sales to a new customer. Approximately 70% of Greater China revenue was from the foodservice channel for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 55% in the prior year period. The sold finished goods volume for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to 24 million and 19 million liters, respectively.\n\nGreater China Adjusted EBITDA improved $18.1 million to a loss of $0.4 million compared to a loss of $18.6 million in the prior year period. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher gross profit and reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, as the segment executed on its previously-communicated strategic reset.\n\n**Corporate Overhead**\n\nOatly’s corporate expense, which consists of general overhead costs not allocated to the segments, in the second quarter of 2024 was $27.5 million, a decrease of $2.4 million compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024 was a loss of $24.4 million compared to a loss of $24.3 million in the prior year period.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $142.7 million and total outstanding debt of $438.5 million consisting of Convertible Notes and liabilities to credit institutions. Net cash used in operating activities was $86.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $113.1 million during the prior year period, which was primarily driven by improved operating results, partly offset by cash outflow of $25.4 million related to discontinued construction of the Group’s production facilities in Peterborough, UK and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and a cash outflow of $9.3 million related to the settlement of US securities class action litigation.\n\nCapital expenditures were $20.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $41.0 million in the prior year period and, in addition, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment was $20.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nFree cash flow was an outflow of $106.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to an outflow of $154.1 million during the prior year period. The improvement in free cash flow was driven both by decreased net cash flows used in operating activities and lower capital expenditures, partly offset by the above-mentioned cash outflows relating to discontinued construction of the Group’s production facilities in Peterborough, UK and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas and settlement of US securities class action litigation.\n\n_Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS liquidity measure defined under “Non-IFRS financial measures.” Please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Financial measures” at the end of this press release._\n\n**Outlook** Based on the Company’s assessment of the current operating environment and the actions it is taking, the Company is raising its full year 2024 outlook for constant currency revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA while lowering its guidance for capital expenditures. The Company now expects:\n\n  * Constant currency revenue growth in the range of 6% to 10%, compared to the prior expectation of 5% to 10%,\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss in the range of $(35) million to $(50) million, compared to the prior expectation of range of $(35) million to $(60) million, and\n  * Capital expenditures below $70 million, compared to the prior expectation of below $75 million.\n\n\n\nThis outlook is provided in the context of significant macroeconomic uncertainty and other geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nThe Company cannot provide a reconciliation of constant currency revenue growth or Adjusted EBITDA guidance to the nearest comparable corresponding IFRS metric without unreasonable efforts due to difficulty in predicting certain items excluded from these non-IFRS measures. The items necessary to reconcile are not within Oatly’s control, may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.\n\n**Conference Call, Webcast and Supplemental Presentation Details**\n\nOatly will host a conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. ET today to discuss these results. The conference call, simultaneous, live webcast and supplemental presentation can be accessed on Oatly’s Investors website at https://investors.oatly.com under “Events.” The webcast will be archived for 30 days.\n\n**About Oatly**\n\nWe are the world’s original and largest oat drink company.

Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date hereof and accordingly undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than loss for the period, which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure. Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future increasing our cash requirements;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash required to service our debt, which reduces cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax payments that reduce cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect recurring share-based compensation expense and, therefore, does not include all of our compensation costs;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect restructuring costs that reduce cash available to us in future periods;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA excludes impacts related to discontinued construction of production facilities, although some of these may reduce cash available to us in future period;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect expenses related to a new product launch issue that reduce cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect costs related to the YYF Transaction that reduce cash available to us;\n  * Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with IFRS. Below we have provided a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to loss for the period, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, for the periods presented.\n\n“Constant Currency Revenue” is calculated by translating the current year reported revenue amounts into comparable amounts using the prior year reporting period’s average foreign exchange rates which have been provided by a third party. Constant Currency Revenue is a non-IFRS measure and is not a substitute for IFRS measures in assessing our overall financial performance.\n\nConstant currency revenue is used to provide a framework in assessing how our business and geographic segments performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons and better identify trends in our business. Above we have provided a reconciliation of revenue as reported to revenue on a constant currency basis for the periods presented.\n\n“Free Cash Flow” is defined as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities.\n\nFree Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not a substitute for IFRS measures in assessing our overall financial liquidity. Because Free Cash Flow is not a measurement determined in accordance with IFRS, and is susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported on our interim condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document. Below we have provided a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented.\n\n**Financial Statements**\n\n**Interim condensed consolidated
