We benefited from strong fundraising across our flagship funds and complementary fund offerings, with the fourth quarter being the most active of the year. We raised $93 billion of capital which, combined with the approximately $50 billion anticipated upon the closing of the American Equity Investment Life (AEL) insurance account, brings the total to $143 billion.\n\nThe successful fundraising across our various flagship series continued, with our infrastructure and private equity strategies closing their largest funds ever, as well as strong momentum for many of our complementary funds. Existing limited partners continued to invest into our funds, often increasing their commitments, and a very large number crossed over into new strategies, deepening their overall relationship with us.\n\nOur Fee-Related Earnings (FRE) and Distributable Earnings (DE) were also solid. FRE and DE were $581 million and $586 million in the quarter, respectively. On the back of this achievement on the capital raising front, we are currently projecting a strong year of FRE and DE growth heading into 2024. With that momentum and the significant resources that we have on hand, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend by 19% to $0.38 per share from its current level of $0.32.\n\nOur capital raising success in 2023, combined with investments made into building out our platforms, positions us for strong earnings growth and continued robust fundraising in 2024.\n\n### 2023 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n$143B\n\nNEW CAPITAL COMMITMENTS\n\n$93B\n\nFUNDRAISING CAPITAL RAISED\n\n$2.2B\n\nDISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS\n\n+19%\n\nDIVIDEND GROWTH\n\n### THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT\n\nIt appears that central banks have been successful in dealing with inflation and that interest rates will be going lower around the world in 2024 and 2025. If this occurs, capital market activity and stock markets should be strong.\n\nMarket participants’ confidence in pricing in risk has increased, which has in turn improved liquidity in the capital markets. And with record levels of dry powder currently on the sidelines, we expect a very busy period of transaction activity in the next few years, and valuations for real assets should respond accordingly.\n\nGeopolitics can always lead to heightened volatility, but this seems to have become the new normal. Our view is that being an owner of high-quality businesses and assets that form the backbone of the global economy is a safe place to be across all market cycles. This resilience has been proven over decades.\n\n### FINANCIAL RESULTS AND FUNDRAISING\n\nWe raised capital across all five of our flagships, as well as a number of complementary strategies that were in the market in 2023. We held several large fund closes since we last wrote to you, which raised $33 billion of capital.\n\nThe most significant fundraising updates and deal activity since the beginning of the fourth quarter are:\n\n_Infrastructure_ —In December, we held the final close for the fifth vintage of our flagship infrastructure fund, bringing the total for the strategy to $30 billion. With approximately 200 investors committed to the fund, this fifth vintage is 40% larger than the predecessor vehicle. We are now approximately 40% deployed across six large-scale assets and the momentum on the capital deployment front is very strong. During the fourth quarter we held the final close of the third vintage of our infrastructure debt fund, bringing the total for the strategy to over $6 billion. Over 60% of the investors in this fund are new to the strategy, showcasing Brookfield’s leadership position in the infrastructure debt space.\n\n_Renewable Power and Transition_ —Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we finalized the first close of the second vintage of our flagship global transition fund strategy at $10 billion. In the fourth quarter alone, we raised over $6 billion, including an aggregate $3 billion commitment to our transition strategies received from ALTÉRRA, a sovereign fund and longtime partner, which was announced during COP28.\n\n_Real Estate_ —We are completing the first close of the fifth vintage of our flagship real estate opportunistic fund strategy at $8 billion. This positions the fund to achieve its targeted raise, with a final close expected in 2024. In early December, we sold our majority interest in 150 Champs Elysees, a landmark mixed-use asset in Paris, for a sales price of approximately $1 billion and an excellent return. Also in December, we disposed of an office asset in São Paulo, Brazil for a sale price of $300 million, representing a 17% IRR. These transactions highlight our belief that high quality office and retail in great locations continue to see significant demand and, while transaction volumes have been reduced, values remain strong.\n\n_Private Equity_ —The second vintage of our special investments fund, which provides structured solutions to counterparties, is in the market with an expected rolling first close during the first half of 2024. In conjunction with our recent acquisition of Network International, we were pleased to welcome Sir Ron Kalifa to Brookfield this past fall as Vice Chair and Head of Financial Infrastructure investments within our Private Equity business. Ron will lead a new financial infrastructure group focused on opportunities in digital infrastructure, an area which we believe contains significant growth opportunities supporting the digitalization of the global economy.\n\n_Credit_ —Oaktree raised $30 billion across its franchise in 2023, including $9 billion in the fourth quarter. This included an additional $2 billion in the fourth quarter for the twelfth vintage of our opportunistic credit fund and $1 billion for our strategic lending partners fund, bringing the funds to $8 billion and $4 billion at year-end. Oaktree has a robust pipeline for additional private credit fundraising, and we expect to complete the fundraise for these funds later in 2024.\n\n![2023 BAM Annual Report-Meeting](/sites/default/files/styles/max_width_750/public/images/2024-03/Meeting-2000x1200-Desktop.jpg?itok=GyfOu3EM)\n\n![2023 BAM Annual Report-Meeting](/sites/default/files/styles/max_width_750/public/images/2024-03/Meeting-2000x1200-Desktop.jpg?itok=GyfOu3EM)\n\n### 2024 SHOULD BE A GOOD YEAR BUT WILL REQUIRE MORE HARD WORK\n\nThe free money era of 2020-2022 favored high growth businesses and investors who were aggressive with capital. We chose to pass on many of the transactions during that period as valuations were high. In hindsight, we are very pleased that we stuck to our investing mantra.\n\nFast forward to 2023—as capital became less available, the managers that were prudent during the free money periods, and specifically those with extensive track records of performance and long-term relationships with partners, have excelled. Early last year, we decided that odds favored that rates were going to crest in 2023. While most were struggling with liquidity challenges, we invested over $55 billion. We were able to do this due to our relationships and access to capital. Today, as we start 2024 with interest rates looking like they will decline, we feel very good about the investments we made in 2023 and the ones we will make in 2024.\n\nOur confidence also comes from the way we invest. Most of our return comes from operational excellence in the businesses we run, rather than financial engineering. Our vast operating team of hundreds of thousands of employees gives us a special edge in building value in businesses. Most small, mid-size or merely financially focused firms do not have access to these resources. In an environment where “roll up your sleeves investing” is back in favor, this differentiator should continue to set our franchise apart.\n\nAs we start 2024 with interest rates looking like they will decline, we feel very good about the investments we made in 2023 and the ones we will make in 2024.\n\n### OUR PRODUCT SCALE AND DIVERSITY SUPPORTS CONSISTENT FUNDRAISING\n\nAs we scale our business, our ability to raise larger funds and meet ambitious fundraising targets has grown. Equally important is our continuous effort to diversify fundraising sources and innovate with new products. This strategy ensures our capability to consistently raise capital across various economic conditions. Across our overall franchise we manage over 100 funds, many of which are actively fundraising at any given moment. Our breadth of products, asset classes and fundraising channels enables us to raise +/- $75 billion annually, separate and apart from our flagship funds, which are raised every few years.\n\n**Insurance Solutions Channel** One of the important capital raising channels we have been building is our insurance solutions business. The pending acquisition of AEL will make Brookfield Reinsurance one of the largest writers of annuities in the U.S., and since we are the beneficiary of the management of these assets, will increase our insurance assets under management by $50 billion. By employing the same operational enhancements that were utilized in the acquisition of American National to meaningfully grow its pace of annuity writing, we believe that over time we will raise $15 to $20 billion of insurance capital annually, independent of acquisitions.\n\n**Private Wealth Channel** Another growing fundraising source is our private wealth business, Brookfield Oaktree Wealth Solutions (BOWS). We have been steadily investing in our private wealth platform, which currently has 150 dedicated employees. We have partnered with more than 50 wealth groups worldwide in delivering institutional quality investment strategies to clients and we currently have five dedicated funds being distributed in this channel, including our infrastructure wealth product launched in early 2023 that has enjoyed strong early investor demand. With the team in place, we should be able to raise $12 to $15 billion of capital annually.\n\n**Newly Formed Credit Group** Our credit capabilities are larger and broader than they have ever been. With the growing importance that private credit will continue to play in capital markets, we expect our private credit funds to raise and deploy increasingly larger sums of capital. After the successful close of our largest infrastructure debt fund at $6 billion in November, we are already approximately 60% deployed and expect to launch the next vintage of that fund later this year at an even larger scale. In addition, we have launched the second vintage of our private equity special investments fund and, later this year, expect to launch the seventh vintage of our real estate credit fund. Our partner, LCM, a European-based alternative credit manager, is continuing to build and raise capital for its successful asset-backed specialty finance strategy.\n\nIn order to manage our growing credit capabilities across Brookfield, Oaktree, LCM, and insurance investment strategies, we are aggregating all of our credit strategies under a new Credit group. We believe this important step will allow us to work effectively across our credit investment teams, provide excellent returns, and maximize our ability to create value for our clients. We are confident that credit will be a meaningful driver of BAM’s growth over the next decade given the industry tailwinds and our collective focus. This will help us achieve that.\n\n**Open End Funds** In 2023, we observed a slowing in demand for our core infrastructure and real estate open-ended funds, likely due to the uncertain and rising interest rate environment's impact on investor preferences. These funds comprise high-quality, stable assets with consistent cash flows, appealing to yield-focused investors. With interest rates now stabilized and anticipated to decrease, we expect renewed interest in these funds. Furthermore, as our funds are medium sized and have no legacy issues with asset values or redemption lines, we should be among the first beneficiaries of fund flows as the market turns.\n\n### PRODUCT INNOVATION ENABLES US TO GROW\n\nCore to our success has been our focus on anticipating changes in the market as we create new products and solutions. Over the past several years, we built a multi-disciplinary product development team that works across our businesses and investor segments to develop products that leverage our investment expertise and global presence. Notably, since 2020, we leveraged our existing business to launch leading platforms in direct corporate lending, global energy transition, and structured product solutions, among other products.\n\nWhile product development has already played an integral role in our success over the past several years, we expect this to be an even bigger driver for us going forward for several key reasons:\n\n###  Competitive Advantage \n\nToggle\n\nIn an increasingly competitive market, being able to offer differentiated and innovative investment products sets us apart, allowing us to take advantage of compelling investment opportunities and attract new investor capital that very few other managers are able to do.\n\n###  Enhancing Client Relationships \n\nToggle\n\nOffering a range of investment solutions helps us build stronger client relationships, as products and structures can be tailored to meet the specific needs and preferences of institutional and individual investors and enable them to access our capabilities more efficiently.\n\n###  Long-Term Focus \n\nToggle\n\nA continuous focus on product development reflects our commitment to long-term growth and sustainability. By staying innovative and responsive to market dynamics and investor demand, we are well positioned to succeed and grow across market cycles through a diversified suite of offerings and strategies.\n\nThis allowed us in 2023 to launch several new products and strategies. Some notable examples include our Catalytic Transition Fund, which we announced at COP28 in Dubai. The fund was anchored by UAE’s ALTÉRRA, who made a commitment of up to $1 billion alongside its $2 billion commitment to our second flagship transition fund. We are actively engaged with other large institutional partners who have expressed interest in this new fund. The new strategy will deploy capital exclusively into emerging and developing markets, with a dedicated focus on supporting energy transition, industrial decarbonization, sustainable living, and climate technologies.\n\nLeveraging our established on-the-ground capabilities and relationships in the Middle East, we recently launched and are currently fundraising for a new fund strategy targeting private equity opportunities in the region. This region is growing fast, and we believe we are the most established sponsor in the market.\n\nIn recent years we have made over $5 billion of investments within the technology-enabled payment infrastructure area, including our recent acquisitions of Network International and Magnati. Our strategy seeks mature, high-quality companies that are an integral component of the financial ecosystem and leverages our expertise in growing businesses through operational value creation.\n\nWe are also working on new products in infrastructure, asset-backed credit, and renewable power. As we turn to 2024 and beyond, we expect to launch several new products as we continue to scale different parts of our business.\n\n![2023 Annual Report-Hawaii-Solar-Panels](/sites/default/files/styles/max_width_750/public/images/2024-03/Solar-Panels-Hawaii-2000x1200-Desktop.jpg?itok=6chXdLR4)\n\n![2023 Annual Report-Hawaii-Solar-Panels](/sites/default/files/styles/max_width_750/public/images/2024-03/Solar-Panels-Hawaii-2000x1200-Desktop.jpg?itok=6chXdLR4)\n\n### DIVERSIFIED MANAGERS OF ESSENTIAL REAL ASSETS ARE IN DEMAND\n\nInfrastructure and renewable power assets remain very much in favor among alternative asset investors who are increasing their allocations, because these assets have been able to deliver strong market growth, have downside protection in uncertain times, generate inflation-protected cash flows, and, if operated well, enable owners to receive long-term capital appreciation.\n\nIn the last fifteen years we have centered our strategies around three mega-trends—decarbonization, deglobalization, and digitalization. Each will require many, many trillions of dollars of capital over the next decades. Simply put, the world is mobilizing to achieve net zero targets, energy security, supply chain resiliency and to meet exponentially growing data demand. Our infrastructure, renewable power and energy transition businesses sit at the epicenter of these trends. These trends will propel our growth for decades to come.\n\nWe were one of the earliest managers to recognize this opportunity and have used our early mover advantage to build scale, gain operational expertise and establish ourselves as the industry leader in the space. Our scale is a significant competitive advantage that we strive to leverage on behalf of our clients, and this should only get better. We have nearly $300 billion of assets under management around the world – across utilities, transport, midstream, and data as well as hydro, wind, solar, distributed generation, and energy storage. We use our footprint and deep relationships to source proprietary opportunities not available to others. This scale also allows us to pursue transactions that require significant operational capabilities or access to capital that few others have.\n\nWe have centered our strategies around three mega-trends—decarbonization, deglobalization, and digitalization.\n\nOur platform is also built on unmatched diversity. Our strategies in the space enable us to participate up and down the capital structure—from opportunistic equity, core equity, mezzanine debt, senior debt through our insurance accounts, preferred equity, and convertible debt. We raise capital across all of our fundraising channels, including from private institutional investors, insurance accounts, private wealth, as well as Brookfield Corporation and our public affiliates.\n\nThe ongoing consolidation trend within the alternative asset management space, which we participated in five years ago through our partnership with Oaktree, is now even more evident as managers are increasingly expanding into high-growth sectors like infrastructure and renewable power.\n\n### CLOSING\n\nWe remain committed to being a world-class asset manager and strive to invest our capital in high-quality assets that earn solid returns, while emphasizing downside protection. The primary objective of the company continues to be to generate increasing cash flows on a per-share basis, and to distribute that cash to you by dividend or share repurchases.\n\nThank you for your interest in Brookfield, and please do not hesitate to contact any of us should you have suggestions, questions, comments, or ideas you wish to share.\n\nSincerely,\n\n**— Bruce Flatt** , Chief Executive Officer & **Connor Teskey** , President\n\n## Brookfield at a Glance\n\nBrookfield Asset Management is one of the largest and fastest growing alternative asset managers in the world. We manage over $900 billion of capital on behalf of more than 2,000 global institutional clients. We have over 2,400 investment and asset management professionals investing in 30 countries across five continents supported by over 240,000 operating employees.\n\nWe draw on our 100+ year heritage as an owner and operator to invest for value and seek to generate strong returns for our clients across economic cycles. We invest in high-quality, essential assets and businesses that form the backbone of the global economy. With a focus on investing in renewable power & transition, infrastructure, private equity, real estate, and credit, we believe that we are well-positioned to capture the significant opportunities ahead, many of which will be driven by the large secular trends of decarbonization, deglobalization and digitalization.\n\n2023 was the first year for Brookfield Asset Management as a separately listed company, providing a simple security that is more easily understood and better appreciated as a pure-play, alternative asset manager by the public markets. We derive nearly all of our earnings from our stable capital base, which is over 85% long-term or perpetual in nature. \n\nWe aim to return 90%–100% of our Distributable Earnings back to our shareholders in the form of a dividend or share repurchases. As of December 31, 2023, we earned over $2 billion of Distributable Earnings per year. At our latest investor day, we set an ambitious five-year growth target to more than double Distributable Earnings to $5 billion by 2028. This growth will come from increasing our Fee-Bearing Capital, which is expected to reach $1 trillion over the next five years.\n\n![2023 Annual Report-Berlin-Comms-Tower](/sites/default/files/styles/max_width_750/public/images/2024-03/Communication-Tower-Germany-2000x1200-Desktop.jpg?itok=qtUiDDe8)\n\n![2023 Annual Report-Berlin-Comms-Tower](/sites/default/files/styles/max_width_750/public/images/2024-03/Communication-Tower-Germany-2000x1200-Desktop.jpg?itok=qtUiDDe8)\n\nWe invest in high-quality, essential assets and businesses that form the backbone of the global economy.\n\n### HOW WE INVEST\n\n###  The Brookfield Ecosystem \n\nToggle\n\nWe invest where we can bring our competitive advantages to bear, leveraging our global presence and reputation, the synergies of our businesses, and access to large-scale, flexible capital.\n\n###  Long-Life, High-Quality Assets and Businesses \n\nToggle\n\nWe invest in a global and diverse portfolio of high-quality assets and businesses that generate stable, inflation-linked, largely contracted and growing revenue streams, and high cash margins.\n\n###  Diverse Product Offering \n\nToggle\n\nWe offer core, core-plus, value-add, opportunistic / growth equity, secondaries, subordinated debt and credit strategies through closed-end and perpetual vehicles in both the public and private markets.\n\n###  Disciplined Financing Approach \n\nToggle\n\nWe take a conservative approach to the use of leverage, ensuring that we can preserve capital across business cycles.\n\n###  Sustainability \n\nToggle\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that the assets and businesses we invest in are set up for long-term success, and we seek to have a positive impact on the environment and the communities in which we operate.\n\n### GLOBAL REACH\n\n![AUM Map](/sites/default/files/styles/max_width_750/public/images/2024-03/2023_bn-ar-aum-map-mobile_0.jpg?itok=ytB7LNsM)\n\n![2023 Annual Report-AUM-Map-Desktop](/sites/default/files/styles/max_width_750/public/images/2024-03/2023_BAM-AR-AUM-Map-Desktop.png?itok=zqLPnfr9)\n\n$900B+\n\nASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT\n\n$457B\n\nFEE-BEARING CAPITAL\n\n2,400+\n\nINVESTMENT & ASSET MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS\n\n30+\n\nCOUNTRIES\n\n~240,000\n\nOPERATING EMPLOYEES\n\n_The “Manager,” the “company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers to Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. together with our asset management business and Oaktree.

(“BPY”), we focus on investing in long-life, high-quality assets that form the backbone of the\nglobal economy. Our ESG strategy is centered on supporting business resilience and creating long-term value for our investors and\nshareholders.\nIn 2021, Brookfield Corporation (“BN”), BPY’s parent company, became a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Managers (“NZAM”)\ninitiative to support the goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner. In the second quarter of 2022, we submitted our 2030 net\nzero interim target, which set out our commitment to reduce emissions by two-thirds by 2030 across one-third of our assets under\nmanagement (AUM) from base year. An updated interim progress report will be released with our PRI Assessment later this year. For\nan outline of Brookfield’s commitment to the NZAM initiative and an update on our progress towards our goal of net-zero GHG\nemissions by 2050 or sooner, please refer to our 2022 Sustainability Report.\nAs a signatory of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”), BN published its first TCFD disclosure in the\n2022 Sustainability Report, updated and finalized its risk assessment, incorporating transition and physical scenarios to depict\npotential climate risks and opportunities while evaluating the resilience of its business against various future warming trajectories.\nThis year, Brookfield Real Estate has also published its first Sustainability Report, highlighting sustainability initiatives undertaken\nacross our real estate business, including our efforts towards decarbonization, transitioning toward sustainable energy, creating an\ninclusive working environment, and our governance practices.\nIn addition, eleven Brookfield Real Estate businesses, representing the majority of our real estate assets under management,\nsubmitted to the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (“GRESB”) in 2023, including our core office businesses in North\nAmerica, Australia, the U.K., Germany and India, our core retail business, Canary Wharf Group, and three private funds – Brookfield\nStrategic Real Estate Partners III (“BSREP III”), Brookfield Premier Real Estate Partners (“BPREP US ”), and Brookfield Premier Real\nEstate Partners Europe (“BPREP-E”).

The\ndevelopment is a 2 million square foot, 58-story office building\ndelivered in 2023.\nTwo Manhattan West is expected to achieve LEED Gold certification\nthrough a combination of enhanced energy efficiency, improved indoor\nair quality, high-performance glazing that maximizes daylight, regional\nsourcing for recycled materials and other innovative green initiatives.\nAs of July 2023, Two Manhattan West is powered by 100% renewable\nelectricity. Superior indoor air quality is achieved through careful\nselection of low-emitting materials, the latest industry standards and\nthe provision for ventilation air. Outdoor air is highly filtered and\nspaces which can be sources of emissions, such as maintenance\nclosets and chemical storage rooms, are separated from the\nsurrounding spaces through air-tight construction and have a\ndedicated exhaust. The property used recycled and regionally-\nmanufactured materials and incorporated FSC-certified wood products\nfor at least 50% of the wood installed.\nWater efficiency and stormwater recycling are achieved through a\ncombination of efficient fixture selection and stormwater harvesting\nand recycling. Water for landscaping is significantly reduced through\nthe reuse of water, a careful selection of adaptive, drought-tolerant\nplant species, and through efficient irrigation techniques.\nAccess to natural light, plus views to the exterior, has been provided\nthrough extensive vision glazing and by maintaining the shortest\npractical distance from the exterior to the core walls. A daylight\ndimming system further decreases lighting power requirements.\n10\nOne Leadenhall – BREEAM Outstanding\nOne Leadenhall is a new development adjacent to the historic\nLeadenhall Market that embraces the different ways in which\nindividuals and institutions want to work, unwind and feel at one with\nthe City, designed by the award-winning architecture practice Make.\nExpected to be completed in 2025, this 35-story tower will bring\n430,000 square feet of office space, a free public terrace and ground\nfloor retail to the center of the Square Mile, London.\nOne Leadenhall offers exceptional amenities, such as a sky garden,\nsculpture park, open-air market, fitness space, onsite childcare, and a\nvariety of restaurants, including the highest outdoor dinning terrace in\nEurope with a panoramic view.\nOne Leadenhall is expected to achieve BREEAM Outstanding in\ndesign for the office portion and WELL Silver.\nAs ActiveScore Platinum certified, One Leadenhall has created\noutstanding accessibility by providing 700+ bicycle spaces and\nlockers, electric charging points for vehicles, and enjoying access to\nfour stations within a 5-minute walk with access to underground and\nnational rail.\nOne Leadenhall is being built with solar PV panels and high-\nperformance glazing systems, high visual light transmittance, and\nusing low-emissivity coatings.\nCreating visually interesting planting throughout the year, specimen\nshrub species bring year-round color whilst a range of herbaceous\nplanting provides injections of color throughout the seasons. In\naddition, varied planting ensures a prolonged flowering season that\nattracts birds and insects and provides sheltered nesting opportunities\nwhich enriches the natural habitats in the neighborhood.\n11\nOne the Esplanade – 5 Star NABERS\nOne the Esplanade is a newly developed 29-story premium grade\nproperty in Perth, providing a total of over 600,000 square feet of\noffice and retail space. The entire building was 100% leased prior to\nconstruction completion.\nOne the Esplanade ensures that public spaces are easily accessible\nto visitors all year round. It created a vibrant hub where people can\ngather, interact and enjoy various amenities such as multiple food\nand beverage outlets, end-of-trip facilities, childcare services, a gym\nand a private exhibition space. The inclusion of generous native\nlandscaped spaces not only enhances the site but also provides a\nhabitat to encourage wildlife.\nOne the Esplanade has been deliberately designed to achieve\nenvironmental success.\nThe project targets to achieve 5 Star NABERS Water, Energy, Indoor\nEnvironment Quality rating, 6 Star Green Star rating, and a IWBI\nWELL Gold Core rating.\nThroughout construction, it achieved 45% reduction in GHG\nemissions along with 90% of waste generated during construction\nand demolition diverting from landfill.\nIt is designed to reduce lighting power density by 50%, peak\nelectricity demand by 30%, and potable water consumption by 50%.\nOne the Esplanade has also installed a grey water system, recycling\nand treating water from sinks and showers for use in cooling towers,\nas well as irrigation and toilet flushing. Furthermore, the project\ncaptures and processes rainwater for onsite use.\n12\nBay Adelaide North – LEED Platinum\nBay Adelaide North is the third and final tower in the Bay Adelaide\nCentre complex, located in Toronto’s financial core. Bay Adelaide\nNorth is a 32-story office building, with a nine-story podium, and\n820,000 square feet, delivered in 2022.\nBay Adelaide North has achieved LEED Platinum certification and\nincludes a glazed curtain wall with a metal panel envelope system and\nbest-in-class operational, environmental and life-safety systems.\nThe Deep Lake Water Cooling (“DLWC”) system by Enwave is\ncurrently used across the entire Bay Adelaide Centre campus. The\nDLWC system is a sustainable alternative to air conditioning, which\ndraws renewable cold water from nearby Lake Ontario to cool\nbuildings. Compared to a chiller, DLWC can reduce electricity\nconsumption by 80%.\nEnwave builds and operates a hot water plant that generates heat\nfrom both natural gas and electrically powered heat pumps to enhance\nresiliency and optimize energy use. A supplemental heat pump\ncaptures residual heat from the DLWC system and recycles it to heat\nthe property.\nBay Adelaide North has a south-facing view of Arnell Plaza, which is a\nhalf-acre of open space and Cloud Gardens Park. The property\nfeatures direct access to subways and to the downtown Toronto PATH\nunderground pedestrian system.\nBay Adelaide North provides 400 bicycle storage facilities and 30\npreferred parking spaces for electric, hybrid, and carpooling vehicles\nfor the users of the complex.\n13"
