(NASDAQ:PEBK) (the \"Company\"), the parent company of Peoples Bank (the \"Bank\"), reported second quarter 2024 results with highlights as follows:\n\n_**Second quarter 2024 highlights:**_\n\n  * Net earnings were $4.9 million or $0.93 per share and $0.89 per diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $4.8 million or $0.88 per share and $0.85 per diluted share for the same period one year ago.\n\n  * Net interest margin was 3.34% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 3.56% for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n_**Year to date highlights:**_\n\n  * Net earnings were $8.8 million or $1.67 per share and $1.61 per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $8.0 million or $1.46 per share and $1.41 per diluted share for the same period one year ago.\n\n  * Cash dividends were $0.54 per share during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $0.53 per share for the prior year period.\n\n  * Total loans were $1.11 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.09 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\n  * Non-performing assets were $4.2 million or 0.25% of total assets at June 30, 2024, compared to $3.9 million or 0.24% of total assets at December 31, 2023.\n\n  * Total deposits were $1.48 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.39 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\n  * Core deposits, a non-GAAP measure, were $1.33 billion or 90.02% of total deposits at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.24 billion or 89.30% of total deposits at December 31, 2023.\n\n  * Net interest margin was 3.34% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 3.67% for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n\nNet earnings were $4.9 million or $0.93 per share and $0.89 per diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $4.8 million or $0.88 per share and $0.85 per diluted share for the prior year period. Lance A. Sellers, President and Chief Executive Officer, attributed the increase in second quarter net earnings to an increase in non-interest income and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, which were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non-interest expense, compared to the prior year period, as discussed below.\n\nNet interest income was $13.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $13.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income is due to a $2.8 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest income reflects a $1.9 million increase in interest income and fees on loans, a $208,000 increase in interest income on balances due from banks and a $359,000 increase in interest income on investment securities. The increase in interest income and fees on loans is primarily due to an increase in total loans and rate increases by the Federal Reserve. The increase in interest income on balances due from banks is also due to an increase in average balances outstanding and rate increases by the Federal Reserve. The increase in interest income on investment securities is primarily due to increases on yields on variable rate securities and higher yields on securities purchased since June 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in time deposits and an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income after the provision for credit losses was $13.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $13.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was a recovery of $468,000, compared to an expense of $375,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses is primarily attributable to a reduction in reserves on construction loans, which was primarily due to a decrease in construction loan balances outstanding composed mostly of about $12.7 million in loans being paid off or transitioning to permanent financing in other loan categories within the portfolio with lower loss rates than the construction pool during the three months ended June 30, 2024. In addition, the high rate environment is slowing additional construction activity resulting in a decrease in unfunded construction loan commitments with about $4.9 million in new commitments offset by the $9.9 million in commitments being utilized to fund loan balances or being closed-out with unused amounts for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nNon-interest income was $7.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $6.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest income is primarily attributable to a $591,000 increase in appraisal management fee income due to an increase in appraisal volume and a $444,000 increase in miscellaneous non-interest income primarily due to an increase in income on Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) investments.\n\nNon-interest expense was $15.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $13.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributable to a $541,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits expense primarily due to increases in salary and restricted stock expenses, a $474,000 increase in appraisal management fee expense due to an increase in appraisal volume and a $373,000 increase in other non-interest expense primarily due to increases in consulting fees and debit card expense.\n\nNet earnings were $8.8 million or $1.67 per share and $1.61 per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $8.0 million or $1.46 per share and $1.41 per diluted share for the prior year period. The increase in second quarter net earnings is primarily attributable to an increase in non-interest income and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, which were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non-interest expense, compared to the prior year period, as discussed below.\n\nNet interest income was $26.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $28.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income is due to a $6.9 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest income reflects a $4.2 million increase in interest income and fees on loans, a $732,000 increase in interest income on balances due from banks and a $589,000 increase in interest income on investment securities. The increase in interest income and fees on loans is primarily due to an increase in total loans and rate increases by the Federal Reserve. The increase in interest income on balances due from banks is also due to an increase in average balances outstanding and rate increases by the Federal Reserve. The increase in interest income on investment securities is primarily due to increases on yields on variable rate securities and higher yields on securities purchased since June 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in time deposits and an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income after the provision for credit losses was $27.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $27.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was a recovery of $377,000, compared to an expense of $599,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses is primarily attributable to a reduction in reserves on construction loans, which was primarily due to a decrease in construction loan balances outstanding composed mostly of about $29.1 million in loans being paid off or transitioning to permanent financing in other loan categories within the portfolio with lower loss rates than the construction pool during the first six months ending June 30, 2024. In addition, the high rate environment is slowing additional construction activity resulting in a decrease in unfunded construction loan commitments with about $12.4 million in new commitments offset by $19.5 million in commitments being utilized to fund loan balances or being closed-out with unused amounts for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nNon-interest income was $13.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $10.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest income is primarily attributable to a $2.5 million net loss on the sales of securities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to no losses in the six months ended June 30, 2024, and a $911,000 increase in appraisal management fee income due to an increase in appraisal volume.\n\nNon-interest expense was $29.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $27.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributable to a $1.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense primarily due to increases in salary, medical insurance and restricted stock expenses, a $728,000 increase in appraisal management fee expense due to an increase in appraisal volume and a $356,000 increase in other non-interest expense primarily due to increases in consulting fees and debit card expense.\n\nIncome tax expense was $1.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. The effective tax rate was 22.09% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 22.20% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Income tax expense was $2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. The effective tax rate was 19.74% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 21.79% for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nTotal assets were $1.66 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $1.64 billion as of December 31, 2023. Available for sale securities were $393.3 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $391.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Total loans were $1.11 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $1.09 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\nNon-performing assets were $4.2 million or 0.25% of total assets at June 30, 2024, compared to $3.9 million or 0.24% at December 31, 2023. Non-performing assets include $3.9 million in commercial and residential mortgage loans, and $267,000 in other loans at June 30, 2024, compared to $3.4 million in commercial and residential mortgage loans, and $464,000 in other loans at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans was $10.0 million or 0.90% of total loans at June 30, 2024, compared to $11.0 million or 1.01% at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $1.6 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.8 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in reserve amounts for loan balances and unfunded commitments is the result of a decrease in both loan balances and unfunded commitments in construction loans. The volume of new unfunded construction commitments decreased in the first six months ended June 30, 2024, which resulted in the volume of funded construction loans decreasing as existing balances mature and migrate to permanent loan categories with loss rates that are lower than the construction category. As such, though the overall loan and charge-off balances increased, the decreases in the construction category are significant enough to reduce the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio which reduces the overall reserving requirements. Management believes the current level of the allowance for credit losses is adequate; however, there is no guarantee that additional adjustments to the allowance will not be required because of changes in economic conditions, regulatory requirements or other factors.\n\nDeposits were $1.48 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $1.39 billion as of December 31, 2023. Core deposits, a non-GAAP measure, which include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, NOW, MMDA, savings and non-brokered certificates of deposit of denominations of $250,000 or less, were $1.33 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.24 billion at December 31, 2023. Management believes it is useful to calculate and present core deposits because of the positive impact this low cost funding source provides to the Bank's overall cost of funds and profitability. Certificates of deposit in amounts of more than $250,000 totaled $147.3 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $148.9 million December 31, 2023.\n\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase were $18.8 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $86.7 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase is primarily due to customers transferring funds from securities sold under agreements to repurchase to deposits via the IntraFi network's Insured Cash Sweep (\"ICS\") during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Junior subordinated debentures were $15.5 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Shareholders' equity was $124.3 million, or 7.51% of total assets, at June 30, 2024, compared to $121.0 million, or 7.40% of total assets, at December 31, 2023.\n\nPeoples Bank operates 16 banking offices in North Carolina, with offices in Catawba, Alexander, Lincoln, Mecklenburg, Iredell and Wake Counties. The Bank also operates loan production offices in Lincoln, Mecklenburg, Rowan and Forsyth Counties. The Company's common stock is publicly traded and is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \"PEBK.\"\n\n**Statements made in this earnings release, other than those concerning historical information, should be considered forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995.

(NASDAQ:PEBK) (the \"Company\"), the parent company of Peoples Bank (the \"Bank\"), reported third quarter 2024 results with highlights as follows:\n\n_**Third quarter 2024 highlights:**_\n\n  * Net earnings were $4.0 million or $0.74 per share and $0.72 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.1 million or $0.76 per share and $0.74 per diluted share for the same period one year ago.\n\n  * Net interest margin was 3.35% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.39% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n_**Year to date highlights:**_\n\n  * Net earnings were $12.8 million or $2.41 per share and $2.33 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $12.1 million or $2.22 per share and $2.15 per diluted share for the same period one year ago.\n\n  * Cash dividends were $0.73 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.72 per share for the prior year period.\n\n  * Total loans were $1.12 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.09 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\n  * Non-performing assets were $3.9 million or 0.24% of total assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n  * Total deposits were $1.48 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.39 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\n  * Core deposits, a non-GAAP measure, were $1.34 billion or 90.30% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.24 billion or 89.30% of total deposits at December 31, 2023.\n\n  * Net interest margin was 3.34% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.57% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n\nNet earnings were $4.0 million or $0.74 per share and $0.72 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.1 million or $0.76 per share and $0.74 per diluted share for the prior year period. William D. Cable, Sr., President and Chief Executive Officer, attributed the decrease in third quarter net earnings to a decrease in non-interest income and an increase in non-interest expense, which were partially offset by an increase in net interest income and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, compared to the prior year period, as discussed below.\n\nNet interest income was $13.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income is due to a $2.2 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income is primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in interest income and fees on loans and a $206,000 increase in interest income on investment securities. The increase in interest income and fees on loans is primarily due to an increase in total loans and rate increases by the Federal Reserve through July 2023. The increase in interest income on investment securities is primarily due to increases in yields on variable rate securities and higher yields on securities purchased since September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in time deposits and an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income after the provision for credit losses was $13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $297,000, compared to $562,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses is primarily attributable to a reduction in reserves on construction loans, which was primarily due to a decrease in construction loan balances outstanding with approximately $12.0 million in loans being paid off or transitioning to permanent financing in loan categories within the portfolio with lower loss rates than the construction pool during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This reduction of reserves due to change in loan mix was partially offset by $669,000 additional reserve during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for expected losses associated with Hurricane Helene, which heavily impacted western North Carolina in late September 2024.\n\nNon-interest income was $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest income is primarily attributable to a $288,000 increase in appraisal management fee income due to an increase in appraisal volume.\n\nNon-interest expense was $15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributable to a $458,000 increase in occupancy expense primarily due to a 362,000 write-off of leasehold improvements for the Bank's branch in Cary, North Carolina, which was closed in June 2024, a $254,000 increase in appraisal management fee expense due to an increase in appraisal volume and a $169,000 increase in other non-interest expense primarily due to an increase in consulting fees. Increases noted above were partially offset by a $120,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense primarily due to a decrease in medical insurance expense.\n\nNet earnings were $12.8 million or $2.41 per share and $2.33 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $12.1 million or $2.22 per share and $2.15 per diluted share for the prior year period. The increase in year-to-date net earnings is primarily attributable to an increase in non-interest income and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, which were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non-interest expense, compared to the prior year period, as discussed below.\n\nNet interest income was $40.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $41.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income is due to a $8.8 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest income reflects a $6.1 million increase in interest income and fees on loans, a $734,000 increase in interest income on balances due from banks and a $795,000 increase in interest income on investment securities. The increase in interest income and fees on loans is primarily due to an increase in total loans and rate increases by the Federal Reserve through July 2023. The increase in interest income on balances due from banks is also due to an increase in average balances outstandingand Federal Reserve rate increases. The increase in interest income on investment securities is primarily due to increases in yields on variable rate securities and higher yields on securities purchased since September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in time deposits and an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income after the provision for credit losses was $40.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a recovery of $80,000, compared to an expense of $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses is primarily attributable to a reduction in reserves on construction loans, which was primarily due to a decrease in construction loan balances outstanding with approximately $34.3 million in loans being paid off or transitioning to permanent financing in loan categories within the portfolio with lower loss rates than the construction pool during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This reduction of reserves due to change in loan mix was partially offset by $669,000 additional reserve during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for expected losses associated with Hurricane Helene, which heavily impacted western North Carolina in late September 2024. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $956,000, compared to $297,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to commercial and industrial loan charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30 2024, which were previously reflected in reserves on individually evaluated loans.\n\nNon-interest income was $20.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest income is primarily attributable to a $2.5 million net loss on the sales of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to a $5,000 net gain on the sales of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a $1.2 million increase in appraisal management fee income due to an increase in appraisal volume.\n\nNon-interest expense was $44.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $41.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributable to a $901,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits expense primarily due to increases in salary and medical insurance expenses, a $679,000 increase in occupancy expense primarily due to a 362,000 write-off of leasehold improvements for the Bank's branch in Cary, North Carolina, which was closed in June 2024, a $982,000 increase in appraisal management fee expense due to an increase in appraisal volume and a $525,000 increase in other non-interest expense primarily due to increases in consulting fees and debit card fraud expense.\n\nIncome tax expense was $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 25.76% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.09% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the revaluation of the deferred tax asset during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to upcoming reductions in the North Carolina corporate income tax rate, which will be phased out over a five year period starting in 2025. Income tax expense was $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 21.70% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21.89% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nTotal assets were $1.66 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $1.64 billion as of December 31, 2023. Available for sale securities were $398.6 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $391.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Total loans were $1.12 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $1.09 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\nNon-performing assets were $3.9 million or 0.24% of total assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Non-performing assets include $3.7 million in commercial and residential mortgage loans, and $266,000 in other loans at September 30, 2024, compared to $3.4 million in commercial and residential mortgage loans, and $464,000 in other loans at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans was $10.6 million or 0.94% of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to $11.0 million or 1.01% at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses on loans is primarily composed of a $471,000 decrease in allowance for other construction loans, all land development, and other land loans as a result of loan balance decreases in this category during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a $360,000 decrease in allowance for commercial and industrial loans primarily due to a $432,000 decrease in reserves on individually evaluated loans in this category at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 due to charge offs during the first quarter of 2024. These decreases were partially offset by $669,000 additional reserve for expected losses associated with Hurricane Helene during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $1.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.8 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was primarily due to a $506,000 decrease in the allowance for other construction loans and all land development and other land loans resulting from a $16.3 million decrease in unfunded commitments in this category during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Management believes the current level of the allowance for credit losses is adequate; however, there is no guarantee that additional adjustments to the allowance will not be required because of changes in economic conditions, regulatory requirements or other factors.\n\nDeposits were $1.48 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $1.39 billion as of December 31, 2023. Core deposits, a non-GAAP measure, which include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, NOW, MMDA, savings and non-brokered certificates of deposit of denominations of $250,000 or less, were $1.34 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.24 billion at December 31, 2023. Management believes it is useful to calculate and present core deposits because of the positive impact this low cost funding source provides to the Bank's overall cost of funds and profitability. Certificates of deposit in amounts of more than $250,000 totaled $143.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $148.9 million December 31, 2023.\n\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase were $8.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $86.7 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase is primarily due to customers transferring funds from securities sold under agreements to repurchase to deposits held via the IntraFi network's Insured Cash Sweep (\"ICS\") during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Junior subordinated debentures were $15.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Shareholders' equity was $136.3 million, or 8.20% of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared to $121.0 million, or 7.40% of total assets, at December 31, 2023.\n\nPeoples Bank operates 16 banking offices in North Carolina, with offices in Catawba, Alexander, Lincoln, Mecklenburg, Iredell and Wake Counties. The Bank also operates loan production offices in Lincoln, Mecklenburg, Rowan and Forsyth Counties.

This amount has been computed using an effective tax rate of 22.98% and is reduced by the related nondeductible portion of interest expense._\n\n_(2) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023._\n\n**Contact:**\n\nWilliam D.
