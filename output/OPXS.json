Announces\nFinancial Highlights for the Three and Nine\nmonths Ended June 30, 2024\nRICHARDSON, TX / ACCESSWIRE / August 13, 2024 /O ptex Systems Holdings, Inc.\n(Nasdaq:OPXS), a leading manufacturer of precision optical sighting systems for domestic\nand worldwide military and commercial applications, announced financial results for the\nthree and nine months ended June 30, 2024.\nDanny Schoening, CEO of Optex Systems Holdings, Inc., commented, \"It was an excellent\nquarter across the board. With supply chain constraints easing, automation efforts coming\non line, and more appropriate staffing levels, we are shipping product at an increased\nvelocity. I can't say enough about our employees' willingness to put in the extra effort to\nmeet our customer's demands. Our products are mission critical and we thank the entire\nOptex team for their dedication.\"\nBacklog as of June 30, 2024 was $45.6 million. This compares to a backlog of $41.8 million\nas of October 1, 2023, representing an increase of $3.8 million, or 9.1%, and a backlog of\n$41.6 million as of July 2, 2023, representing an increase of $4.0 million, or 9.6%.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, our total revenues increased by $1.9 million, or\n26.3%, compared to the prior year period. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by\nincreased deliveries at both the Optex Richardson segment of $1.6 million and the Applied\nOptics Center segment of $0.3 million. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our total\nrevenues increased by $7.0 million, or 39.6%, compared to the prior year period. The\nincrease in revenue was primarily driven by increased deliveries at both the Optex\nRichardson segment of $4.6 million and the Applied Optics Center segment of $2.4 million.\nThe increase in revenue for the three and nine-month periods were driven by increased\ncustomer demand for military products across both operating segments partially offset by\nlower customer demand in commercial optical assemblies at the Applied Optics Center.\nConsolidated gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $1.2\nmillion, or 68.3%, compared to the prior year period. Consolidated gross profit for the nine\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 increased by $3.1 million, or 78.8%, compared to the prior\nyear period. The increase in the most recent three and nine-month period gross margin was\nprimarily attributable to higher revenue spread across a fixed manufacturing cost base\ncombined with changes in product mix and improved pricing and operating performance in\nboth operating segments.\nOur operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $0.9 million,\nor 114.8%, compared to the prior year period. Our operating income for the nine months\nended June 30, 2024 increased by $2.4 million, or 224.4%, compared to the prior year\nperiod. The increase in operating income for the three and nine-month periods was primarily\ndriven by higher revenue and increased gross margin at both operating segments.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of $14.2 million, as compared to\n$13.5 million as of October 1, 2023. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the\nCompany had operating cash provided by operations of $1.0 million, and spent $0.5 million\non acquisitions of property and equipment and $1.0 million on the acquisition of intellectual\nproperty. During the period, our inventory increased $3.0 million in support of new program\nawards and increasing revenues anticipated over the next twelve months.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Company had $0.5 million in cash and an outstanding payable\nbalance of $1.0 million against its line of credit. At June 30, 2024, our outstanding accounts\nreceivable balance was $3.3 million.\nOur key performance measures for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and\nJuly 2, 2023 are summarized below.\n(Thousands)\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nJune 30, July 2, % June 30, July 2, %\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nMetric\n$ 9,060 $ 7,172 26.3 $ 24,552 $ 17,582 39.6\nRevenue\n$ 2,881 $ 1,712 68.3 $ 7,122 $ 3,983 78.8\nGross Profit\n31.8% 23.9% 33.1 29.0% 22.7% 27.8\nGross Margin %\n$ 1,615 $ 752 114.8 $ 3,523 $ 1,086 222.4\nOperating Income\n$ 1,261 $ 579 118.9 $ 2,754 $ 832 231.0\nNet Income\n$ 1,837 $ 919 99.9 $ 4,224 $ 1,472 187.0\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company booked $28.3 million in new\norders, representing a 7.6% increase over the prior year period.

This non-GAAP measure excludes certain\ncash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry\nmay calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, which\nlimits the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative measure.\nOur net income increased by $0.7 million to $1.3 million for the three months ended June\n30, 2024, as compared to net income of $0.6 million for the prior year period. Our adjusted\nEBITDA increased by $0.9 million to $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024,\nas compared to $0.9 million for the prior year period. Our net income increased by $1.9\nmillion to $2.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to a net\nincome of $0.8 million for the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.7\nmillion to $4.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $1.5 million\nfor the prior year period. The increase in the most recent three and nine-month period net\nincome and adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by increased revenue and gross profit,\nwhich was only partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses.\nHighlights of the Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations have been prepared in\naccordance with GAAP.

The increase in revenue for the three and nine-month periods were driven by increased customer demand for military products across both operating segments partially offset by lower customer demand in commercial optical assemblies at the Applied Optics Center.\n\nConsolidated gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $1.2 million, or 68.3%, compared to the prior year period. Consolidated gross profit for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $3.1 million, or 78.8%, compared to the prior year period. The increase in the most recent three and nine-month period gross margin was primarily attributable to higher revenue spread across a fixed manufacturing cost base combined with changes in product mix and improved pricing and operating performance in both operating segments.\n\nOur operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $0.9 million, or 114.8%, compared to the prior year period. Our operating income for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $2.4 million, or 224.4%, compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating income for the three and nine-month periods was primarily driven by higher revenue and increased gross margin at both operating segments.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of $14.2 million, as compared to $13.5 million as of October 1, 2023. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had operating cash provided by operations of $1.0 million, and spent $0.5 million on acquisitions of property and equipment and $1.0 million on the acquisition of intellectual property. During the period, our inventory increased $3.0 million in support of new program awards and increasing revenues anticipated over the next twelve months.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, the Company had $0.5 million in cash and an outstanding payable balance of $1.0 million against its line of credit. At June 30, 2024, our outstanding accounts receivable balance was $3.3 million.\n\nOur key performance measures for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023 are summarized below.\n\n**(Thousands)**  \n---  \n**Three months ended** | **Nine months ended**  \n**Metric** | **June 30,****2024** | **July 2,****2023** | **%****Change** | **June 30,****2024** | **July 2,****2023** | **%****Change**  \nRevenue | $ | 9,060 | $ | 7,172 | 26.3 | $ | 24,552 | $ | 17,582 | 39.6  \nGross Profit | $ | 2,881 | $ | 1,712 | 68.3 | $ | 7,122 | $ | 3,983 | 78.8  \nGross Margin % | 31.8 | % | 23.9 | % | 33.1 | 29.0 | % | 22.7 | % | 27.8  \nOperating Income | $ | 1,615 | $ | 752 | 114.8 | $ | 3,523 | $ | 1,086 | 222.4  \nNet Income | $ | 1,261 | $ | 579 | 118.9 | $ | 2,754 | $ | 832 | 231.0  \nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) | $ | 1,837 | $ | 919 | 99.9 | $ | 4,224 | $ | 1,472 | 187.0  \n  \nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company booked $28.3 million in new orders, representing a 7.6% increase over the prior year period. The orders for the most recently completed nine months consist of $18.5 million for our Optex Richardson segment and $9.8 million attributable to the Applied Optics Center segment.\n\nThe table below summarizes our three and nine-month operating results for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023, in terms of both the GAAP net income measure and the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA measure. We believe that including both measures allows the reader better to evaluate our overall performance.\n\n**(Thousands)**  \n---  \n**Three months ended** | **Nine months ended**  \n**June 30, 2024** | **July 2, 2023** | **June 30, 2024** | **July 2, 2023**  \nNet Income (GAAP) | $ | 1,261 | $ | 576 | $ | 2,754 | $ | 832  \n_Add:_  \nFederal Income Tax Expense | 337 | 154 | 737 | 223  \nDepreciation | 132 | 86 | 341 | 252  \nStock Compensation | 90 | 81 | 360 | 134  \nInterest Expense | 17 | 22 | 32 | 31  \n**Adjusted EBITDA - Non GAAP** | **$** | **1,837** | **$** | **919** | **$** | **4,224** | **$** | **1,472**  \n  \nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. This non-GAAP measure excludes certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative measure.\n\nOur net income increased by $0.7 million to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to net income of $0.6 million for the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA increased by $0.9 million to $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $0.9 million for the prior year period. Our net income increased by $1.9 million to $2.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to a net income of $0.8 million for the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.7 million to $4.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $1.5 million for the prior year period. The increase in the most recent three and nine-month period net income and adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by increased revenue and gross profit, which was only partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses.\n\nHighlights of the Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “Optex Systems Holdings,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) manufactures optical sighting systems and assemblies for the U.S. Department of Defense, foreign military applications and commercial markets. Its products are installed on a variety of U.S. military land vehicles, such as the Abrams and Bradley fighting vehicles, light armored and advanced security vehicles, and have been selected for installation on the Stryker family of vehicles. The Company also manufactures and delivers numerous periscope configurations, rifle and surveillance sights and night vision optical assemblies. Optex Systems Holdings’ products consist primarily of build to customer print products that are delivered both directly to the military and to other defense prime contractors or commercial customers. The Company’s consolidated revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 were derived from the U.S. government (19%), three major U.S. defense contractors (24%, 8%, and 7%, respectively), one major commercial customer (15%) and all other customers (27%). Approximately 94% of the total company revenue is generated from domestic customers and 6% is derived from foreign customers, primarily in Canada and Israel. Optex Systems Holdings’ operations are based in Dallas and Richardson, Texas in leased facilities comprising 93,967 square feet. As of June 30, 2024, Optex Systems Holdings operated with 122 full-time equivalent employees.\n\n**Note 2 - Accounting Policies**\n\n**Basis of Presentation**\n\n**_Principles of Consolidation : _**The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Optex Systems, Inc. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements of Optex Systems Holdings included herein have been prepared by Optex Systems Holdings, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in conjunction with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.\n\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Optex Systems Holdings’ Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2023 and other reports filed with the SEC.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Optex Systems Holdings for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for these periods are not necessarily comparable to, or indicative of, results of any other interim period or for the fiscal year taken as a whole. Certain information that is not required for interim financial reporting purposes has been omitted.\n\n**_Inventory : _**As of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, inventory included:\n\nSchedule of Inventory\n\nJune 30, 2024 | October 1, 2023  \n---|---  \n(Thousands)  \nJune 30, 2024 | October 1, 2023  \nRaw Material | $| 9,302 | $| 8,211  \nWork in Process | 6,164 | 4,460  \nFinished Goods | 659 | 489  \nGross Inventory | $| 16,125 | $| 13,160  \nLess: Inventory Reserves | (1,007| ) | (1,007| )  \nNet Inventory | $| 15,118 | $| 12,153  \n  \nF-6  \n---  \n  \n**_Concentration of Credit Risk :_** The Company’s accounts receivables as of June 30, 2024 consisted of U.S. government agencies (14%), five major U.S. defense contractors (22%, 11%, 11%, 10%, and 6%, respectively), one commercial customer (12%) and all other customers (14%). The Company does not believe that this concentration results in undue credit risk because of the financial strength of the customers and the Company’s long history with these customers.\n\n**_Accrued Warranties : _**The Company accrues product warranty liabilities based on the historical return rate against period shipments as they occur and reviews and adjusts these accruals quarterly for any significant changes in estimated costs or return rates. The accrued warranty liability includes estimated costs to repair or replace returned warranty backlog units currently in-house plus estimated costs for future warranty returns that may be incurred against warranty covered products previously shipped as of the period end date. As of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the Company had warranty reserve balances of $36 thousand and $75 thousand, respectively.\n\nSchedule of Warranty Reserves\n\nJune 30, 2024 | July 2, 2023 | June 30, 2024 | July 2, 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \nThree months ended | Nine months ended  \nJune 30, 2024 | July 2, 2023 | June 30, 2024 | July 2, 2023  \nBeginning balance | $| 69 | $| 266 | $| 75 | $| 169  \nIncurred costs for warranties satisfied during the period | (15| ) | (82| ) | (52| ) | (99| )  \nWarranty Expenses:  \nWarranties reserved for new product shipped during the period _(1)_ | 26 | 57 | 90 | 177  \nChange in estimate for pre-existing warranty liabilities _(2)_ | (44| ) | - | (77| ) | (6| )  \n(Reversal of) Warranty Expense | (18| ) | 57 | 13 | 171  \nEnding balance | $| 36 | $| 241 | $| 36 | $| 241  \n_(1)_ | _Warranty expenses accrued to cost of sales (based on current period shipments and historical warranty return rate.)_  \n---|---  \n_(2)_ | _Changes in estimated warranty liabilities recognized in cost of sales associated with: the period end customer returned warranty backlog, or the actual costs of repaired/replaced warranty units which were shipped to the customer during the current period._  \n  \n**_Use of Estimates : _**The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates.\n\n**_Fair Value of Financial Instruments : _**Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of the financial statement presentation date.\n\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are carried at, or approximate, fair value as of the reporting date because of their short-term nature. The credit facility is reported at fair value as it bears market rates of interest.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions.\n\nF-7  \n---  \n  \nThe accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. An asset or liability’s level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value estimates are reviewed at the origination date and again at each applicable measurement date and interim or annual financial reporting dates, as applicable for the financial instrument, and are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management at those times.\n\n**_Revenue Recognition : _**The majority of the Company’s contracts and customer orders originate with fixed determinable unit prices for each deliverable quantity of goods defined by the customer order line item (performance obligation) and include the specific due date for the transfer of control and title of each of those deliverables to the customer at pre-established payment terms, which are generally within thirty to sixty days from the transfer of title and control. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs after the customer obtains control of the goods. In addition, the Company has one ongoing service contract which relates to optimized weapon system support (OWSS) and includes ongoing program maintenance, repairs and spare inventory support for the customer’s existing fleet units in service during the duration of the contract. Revenue recognition for this program has been recorded by the Company, and compensated by the customer, at fixed monthly increments over time, consistent with the defined contract maintenance period. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, there was $126 thousand and $357 thousand in service contract revenue. During the three and nine months ended July 2, 2023, there was $115 thousand and $340 thousand in service contract revenue.\n\nDuring the three- and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2024, there was $161 thousand of revenue recognized from customer deposit liabilities (deferred contract revenue). During the three- and nine-month periods ended July 2, 2023, there was zero and $223 thousand of revenue recognized from customer deposit liabilities (deferred contract revenue). As of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, customer deposit liabilities were $320 thousand and $481 thousand, respectively.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, there was $250 and $336 thousand in accrued selling expenses and $237 and $336 thousand in contract assets related to a new $3.4 million contract booked in November 2022. The costs will be amortized against the revenue for the contract deliveries which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and extend into fiscal year 2025.\n\n**_Contract Loss Reserves : _**The Company records loss provisions in the event that the current estimated total revenue against a contract and the total estimated cost remaining to fulfill the contract indicate a loss upon completion. When the estimated costs indicate a loss, we record the entire value of the loss against the contract loss reserve in the period the determination is made. The Company has several long-term fixed price contracts that are currently indicative of a loss condition due to recent inflationary pressures on material and labor, combined with increased manufacturing overhead costs. One of these long-term contracts has an option year ordering period ending in February 2025 with deliveries that may extend into February 2026. As of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the accrued contract loss reserves were $101 thousand and $243 thousand, respectively. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain on changes in estimates for the contract loss reserves of $16 thousand and $45 thousand and applied reserves of $34 thousand and $97 thousand to cost of sales against revenues booked during the periods, respectively.\n\n**_Income Tax/Deferred Tax : _**As of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the Company had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of ($0.8) million against deferred tax assets of $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, for a net deferred tax asset of $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The valuation allowance has been established due to historical losses resulting in a Net Operating Loss Carryforward for each of the fiscal years 2011 through 2016 which may not be fully recognized due to an IRS Section 382 limitation related to a change in control. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our deferred tax assets decreased by $0.1 million related to temporary tax adjustments.\n\n**_Earnings per Share : _**Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available for common shareholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.\n\nF-8  \n---  \n  \nThe Company has potentially dilutive securities outstanding, which include unvested restricted stock units and unvested shares of restricted stock. The Company uses the Treasury Stock Method to compute the dilutive effect of any dilutive shares. Unvested restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock that are anti-dilutive are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, 60,000 shares of unvested restricted stock and 66,500 unvested restricted stock units (which convert to an aggregate of 88,401 and 67,434 incremental shares), respectively, were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. For the three and nine months ended July 2, 2023, 120,000 shares of unvested restricted stock (which convert to an aggregate of 43,141 and 35,011 incremental shares), respectively, were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.\n\n**Note 3 - Segment Reporting**\n\nThe Company’s two reportable segments, Applied Optics Center and Optex Richardson, are strategic businesses offering similar products to similar markets and customers; however, they are operated and managed separately due to differences in manufacturing technology, equipment, geographic location, and specific product mix. Applied Optics Center was acquired as a unit, and management at the time of the acquisition was retained.\n\nThe Applied Optics Center segment also serves as the key supplier of laser coated filters used in the production of periscope assemblies for the Optex Richardson segment. Intersegment sales and transfers are accounted for at annually agreed to pricing rates based on estimated segment product cost, which includes segment direct manufacturing and general and administrative costs, but exclude profits that would apply to third party external customers.\n\n**_Optex Richardson – Richardson, Texas_**\n\nOptex Richardson revenues are primarily in support of prime and subcontracted military customers. Military sales to prime and subcontracted customers represented approximately 98% and sales to commercial customers represented approximately 2% of the external segment revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. The Optex Richardson segment revenue is comprised of approximately 85% domestic military customers and 13% foreign military customers. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024, Optex Richardson represented 50% of the Company’s total consolidated revenue and consisted of revenue from the U.S. government (14%), one major U.S. defense contractor (21%) and all other customers (15%).\n\nOptex Richardson is located in Richardson Texas, with leased premises consisting of approximately 49,100 square feet. As of June 30, 2024, the Richardson facility operated with 77 full-time equivalent employees in a single shift operation which includes 8 home office support employees. The facilities at Optex Richardson serve as the home office for both the Optex Richardson and Applied Optics Center segments.\n\n**_Applied Optics Center (AOC) – Dallas, Texas_**\n\nThe Applied Optics Center serves primarily domestic U.S. customers. Sales to commercial customers represented approximately 29% and military sales to prime and subcontracted customers represented approximately 71% of the external segment revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. Approximately 95% of the AOC revenue was derived from external customers and approximately 5% was related to intersegment sales to Optex Richardson in support of military contracts. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024, AOC represented 50% of the Company’s total consolidated revenue and consisted of revenue from the U.S government (5%), two major defense contractor (8% and 7%), one commercial customer (14%), and all other customers (16%).\n\nThe Applied Optics Center is located in Dallas, Texas with leased premises consisting of approximately 44,867 square feet of space. As of June 30, 2024, AOC operated with 45 full-time equivalent employees in a single shift operation.\n\nThe financial tables below present information on the reportable segments’ profit or loss for each period, as well as segment assets as of each period end.

The Company also leases certain office equipment under non-cancellable operating leases.\n\nThe leased facility under Optex Systems located at 1420 Presidential Drive, Richardson, Texas consists of 49,100 square feet of space at the premises. The previous lease term for this location expired March 31, 2021 and the monthly base rent was $24.6 thousand through March 31, 2021. On January 11, 2021 the Company executed a sixth amendment extending the terms of the lease for eighty-six (86) months, commencing on April 1, 2021 and ending on May 31, 2028. The initial base rent is set at $25.3 thousand and escalates 3% on April 1 each year thereafter. The initial term included 2 months of rent abatement for April and May of 2021. The monthly rent includes approximately $12 thousand for additional Common Area Maintenance fees and taxes (“CAM”), to be adjusted annually based on actual expenses incurred by the landlord.\n\nThe leased facility under the Applied Optics Center located at 9839 and 9827 Chartwell Drive, Dallas, Texas, consists of 44,867 square feet of space at the premises. The previous lease term for this location expired on October 31, 2021 and the monthly base rent was $21.9 thousand through the end of the lease. On January 11, 2021 the Company executed a first amendment extending the terms of the lease for eighty-six (86) months, commencing on November 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2028. The initial base rent is set at $23.6 thousand as of January 1, 2022 and escalates 2.75% on January 1 each year thereafter. The initial term includes two months of rent abatement for November and December of 2021. The amendment provides for a five-year renewal option at the end of the lease term at the greater of the then “prevailing rental rate” or the then current base rental rate. Our obligations to make payments under the lease are secured by a $125,000 standby letter of credit. The monthly rent includes approximately $13 thousand for additional CAM, to be adjusted annually based on actual expenses incurred by the landlord.\n\nThe Company had one non-cancellable office equipment lease with a commencement date of October 1, 2018 and a term of 39 months. The lease cost for the equipment was $1.5 thousand per month from October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2021. The lease was renewed on November 18, 2021 for an additional 48 months at a cost of $1.2 thousand per month. The start of the lease was delayed until April 2022 due to temporary equipment shortages. The lease renewal resulted in the recognition of an additional right of use asset and a lease liability of $51 thousand during the year ended October 2, 2022.\n\nF-12  \n---  \n  \nAs of June 30, 2024, the remaining minimum base lease and estimated common area maintenance (CAM) payments under the non-cancellable office equipment and facility space leases are as follows:\n\nSchedule of Non-cancellable Operating Leases Minimum Payments\n\n**Non-cancellable Operating Leases Minimum Payments**\n\nFiscal Year | Facility Lease Payments | Facility Lease Payments | Lease Payments | Total Lease Payments | Total Variable CAM Estimate  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n(Thousands)  \nOptex Richardson | Applied Optics Center | Office Equipment | Consolidated  \nFiscal Year | Facility Lease Payments | Facility Lease Payments | Lease Payments | Total Lease Payments | Total Variable CAM Estimate  \n2024 Base year lease | $| 83 | $| 75 | $| 4 | $| 162 | $| 75  \n2025 Base year lease | 336 | 305 | 15 | 656 | 306  \n2026 Base year lease | 346 | 313 | 3 | 662 | 312  \n2027 Base year lease | 357 | 322 | - | 679 | 318  \n2028 Base year lease | 242 | 330 | - | 572 | 249  \n2029 Base year lease | - | 83 | - | 83 | 43  \nTotal base lease payments | $| 1,364 | $| 1,428 | $| 22 | $| 2,814 | $| 1,303  \nImputed interest on lease payments _(1)_ | (130| ) | (155| ) | (1| ) | (286| )  \n**Total Operating Lease Liability _(2)_** | $| 1,234 | $| 1,273 | $| 21 | $| 2,528  \n**Right-of-use Asset _(3)_** | $| 1,146 | $| 1,195 | $| 21 | $| 2,362  \n_(1)_ | _Assumes a discount borrowing rate of 5.0% on the new lease amendments effective as of January 11, 2021._  \n---|---  \n_(2)_ | _Includes $ 166 thousand of unamortized deferred rent._  \n_(3)_ | _Short-term and Long-term portion of Operating Lease Liability is $ 634 thousand and $1,894 thousand, respectively._  \n  \nTotal expense under both facility lease agreements for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023 was $223 and $206 thousand, respectively.

(collectively, the “Borrowers”), entered into a line of credit facility (the “PNC Facility”) with BBVA, USA. In June 2021, PNC Bank completed its acquisition of BBVA, USA and the bank name changed to PNC Bank (“PNC”). The substantive terms were as follows:\n\n● | The principal amount of the PNC Facility was $2.25 million. The PNC Facility matured on April 15, 2022. The interest rate was variable based on PNC’s Prime Rate plus a margin of 0.250%, initially set at 3% at loan origination, and all accrued and unpaid interest was payable monthly in arrears starting on May 15, 2020; and the principal amount was due in full with all accrued and unpaid interest and any other fees on April 15, 2022.  \n---|---  \n● | There were commercially standard covenants including, but not limited to, covenants regarding maintenance of corporate existence, not incurring other indebtedness except trade debt, not changing more than 25% stock ownership of Borrowers, and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25:1, with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio defined as (earnings before taxes, amortization, depreciation, amortization and rent expense less cash taxes, distribution, dividends and fair value of warrants) divided by (current maturities on long term debt plus interest expense plus rent expense).   \n● | The PNC Facility contained commercially standard events of default including, but not limited to, not making payments when due; incurring a judgment of $10,000 or more not covered by insurance; not maintaining collateral and the like.  \n● | The PNC Facility was secured by a first lien on all of the assets of Borrowers.  \n  \nF-14  \n---  \n  \nOn April 12, 2022, the Borrowers entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the “PNC Loan Agreement”) with PNC, pursuant to which the PNC Facility was decreased from $2.25 million to $1.125 million, and the maturity date was extended from April 15, 2022 to April 15, 2023. The PNC Loan Agreement required the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.\n\nOn November 21, 2022, the Borrowers issued an Amended and Restated Revolving Line of Credit Note (the “Line of Credit Note”) to PNC in connection with an increase of the Borrower’s revolving line of credit facility under the PNC Loan Agreement from $1.125 million to $2.0 million. The maturity date remained April 15, 2023. Obligations outstanding under the credit facility accrued interest at a rate equal to the Lender’s prime rate minus 0.25%.\n\nThe Line of Credit Note and PNC Loan Agreement contained customary events of default and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, investments, and restricted payments. The PNC Facility was secured by substantially all of the operating assets of the Borrowers as collateral. The Borrowers’ obligations under the PNC Facility were subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Line of Credit Note and PNC Loan Agreement.\n\nThe PNC Facility was replaced by the Texas Capital Facility on March 22, 2023.\n\n**Credit Facility — Texas Capital Bank**\n\nOn March 22, 2023, the Borrowers entered into a Business Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Texas Capital Bank (the “Lender”), pursuant to which the Lender will make available to the Borrowers a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of $3 million (the “Texas Capital Facility”). The Texas Capital Facility replaced the $2 million PNC Facility.\n\nThe commitment period for advances under the Texas Capital Facility is twenty-six months expiring on May 22, 2025. We refer to the expiration of that time period as the “Maturity Date.” Outstanding advances under the Texas Capital Facility will accrue interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus a specified margin, subject to a specified floor interest rate. As of June 30, 2024 the interest rate was 8.07% per annum.\n\nThe Loan Agreement contains customary events of default (including a 25% change in ownership) and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes (including changes in management), investments, and restricted payments (including cash dividends). The Loan Agreement also requires the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 and a total leverage ratio of 3.00:1. The Texas Capital Facility is secured by substantially all of the operating assets of the Borrowers as collateral. The Borrowers’ obligations under the Texas Capital Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement further provides for a $125,000 Letter of Credit sublimit. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of June 30, 2024.\n\nThe outstanding balance under the Texas Capital Facility was $1.0 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\nFor the three months and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the total interest expense under the Texas Capital Facility was $17 thousand and $32 thousand, respectively.\n\nF-15  \n---  \n  \n**Note 6 - Stock Based Compensation**\n\n**Restricted Stock, Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units issued to Directors, Officers and Employees**\n\nThe following table summarizes the status of Optex Systems Holdings’ aggregate non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units and performance shares:\n\nSchedule of Aggregate Non-vested Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units Granted and Performance Shares\n\nRestricted Stock Units | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value | Restricted Shares | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value | Performance Shares | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nOutstanding at October 2, 2022 | 66,000 | $| 1.52 | 180,000 | $| 1.75 | - | -  \nGranted | 42,000 | 3.05 | 40,000 | 3.09 | 135,000 | 2.37  \nVested | (66,000| ) | 1.52 | (60,000| ) | 1.75 | - | -  \nForfeited | (3,000| ) | 3.00 | (40,000| ) | 1.75 | - | -  \nOutstanding at October 1, 2023 | 39,000 | $| 3.06 | 120,000 | $| 2.20 | 135,000 | 2.37  \nGranted | 39,500 | 7.17 | - | - | - | -  \nVested | (12,000| ) | 3.00 | (60,000| ) | 2.20 | (135,000| ) | 2.37  \nForfeited | - | - | - | - | - | -  \nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 | 66,500 | $| 5.51 | 60,000 | $| 2.20 | - | $| -  \n  \nOn January 2, 2019, the Company granted 150,000 and 50,000 restricted stock units with a January 2, 2019 grant date to Danny Schoening and Karen Hawkins, respectively, vesting as of January 1 each year subsequent to the grant date over a three-year period at a rate of 34% in year one, and 33% each year thereafter. The stock price at grant date was $1.32 per share. Effective December 1, 2021, the vesting terms of Danny Schoening’s Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) grant from January 2019 were revised as described below. The Company amortizes the grant date fair value of $264 thousand to stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis across the three-year vesting period beginning on January 2, 2019. As of June 30, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation cost relating to this award.\n\nOn February 17, 2020, the Company granted 50,000 restricted stock units to Bill Bates, General Manager of the Applied Optics Center. The restricted stock units vest as of January 1 each year subsequent to the grant date over a three-year period at a rate of 34% in year one, and 33% each year thereafter. The stock price at grant date was $2.13 per share. The Company amortized the grant date fair value of $107 thousand to stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis across the three-year vesting period beginning on February 17, 2020.\n\nOn April 30, 2020, the Board of Directors held a meeting and voted to increase the annual board compensation for the three independent directors from $22,000 to $36,000 with an effective date of January 1, 2020, in addition to granting 100,000 shares of restricted stock to each independent director which vest at a rate of 20% per year (20,000 shares) each January 1st through January 1, 2025. The total fair value for the 300,000 shares was $525 thousand based on the stock price of $1.75 as of April 30, 2020. On each of January 1, 2021, January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2023, 60,000 of the restricted director shares vested. On February 16, 2023, 40,000 of the unvested restricted shares were forfeited and cancelled when one of the independent directors departed the Board. \n\nThe Company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Danny Schoening dated December 1, 2021.The updated employment agreement also served to amend Mr. Schoening’s RSU Agreement, dated January 2, 2019, by changing the third and final vesting date for the restricted stock units granted under such agreement from January 1, 2022 to the “change of control date,” that being the first of the following to occur with respect to the Company: (i) any “Person,” as that term is defined in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), with certain exclusions, is or becomes the “Beneficial Owner” (as that term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities; or (ii) the Company is merged or consolidated with any other corporation or other entity, other than: (A) a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or (B) the Company engages in a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no “Person” (as defined above) acquires fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities. The amended RSU Agreement contains certain exceptions to the definition of change of control.\n\nF-16  \n---  \n  \nAs of the December 1, 2021 modification date related to the third and final vesting date of the 49,500 unvested restricted stock units held by Danny Schoening, there was no change in the fair value of the modified award as compared to the original award immediately prior to the modification date. The restricted stock units initially were certain to vest on January 1, 2022, but due to the modification, they were less certain to vest, contingent on a “change in control” occurring, which change in control, in case Mr. Schoening was terminated by the Company without cause or he resigns with good reason prior to such change in control, was required to occur prior to March 13, 2023. As of the modification date, there was $5 thousand of unrecognized compensation cost associated with the original award. As a matter of expediency, the unrecognized compensation expense as of the modification date was fully expensed through January 1, 2022. There is no additional compensation expense associated with the modification of the restricted stock unit agreement.\n\nOn November 28, 2022, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Danny Schoening which amended Mr. Schoening’s RSU Agreement, dated January 2, 2019, which had been previously amended as of December 1, 2021, by changing the third and final vesting date for the restricted stock units granted under such agreement from the “change of control date” to January 1, 2023.\n\nOn January 4, 2023, the Company issued 46,432 common shares to Danny Schoening, CEO, and Bill Bates (AOC GM), net of tax withholding of $58 thousand, in settlement of 66,000 restricted stock units which vested on January 1, 2023.\n\nOn May 1, 2023, the Company granted an aggregate of 39,000 restricted stock units to eleven employees under its 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. As of the grant date, assuming a 23.1% forfeiture rate based on expected turnover across the three years, the aggregate value of the restricted stock units is $90 thousand which will be amortized across the three-year period on a straight-line basis. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, there were 3,000 restricted stock units forfeited. On August 14, 2023 there was an additional grant of 3,000 restricted stock units to one new employee with a fair value of $11 thousand. The restricted stock units will vest at a rate of 33.33% annually on the anniversary date of the grant and any unvested restricted stock units will be forfeited if employment terminates prior to the relevant vesting date.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, there were 66,500 and 39,000 unvested restricted stock units outstanding, respectively.\n\nOn May 3, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 100,000 and 35,000 performance shares to Danny Schoening, CEO, and Karen Hawkins, CFO, respectively. Each performance share represents a contingent right to receive one share of common stock. The performance shares vest in five equal increments if, in each case and during a five-year performance period beginning on October 2, 2023, the average VWAP per share of common stock over a 30 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds $3.70, $4.45, $5.35, $6.40, or $7.70. The fair value of the shares, as of the grant date, is $320 thousand and will be amortized through December 31, 2025 based on the derived service periods using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model.\n\nOn May 9, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 40,000 shares of restricted stock to independent board member Dayton Judd. The shares vest 50% on each of January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025. As of the grant date, the fair value of the shares was $124 thousand, to be amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, there were 60,000 unvested restricted shares outstanding.\n\nOn October 2, 2023, 27,000 performance shares vested for reaching the 30-day VWAP for Tranche 1. The Company issued a total of 21,060 shares on October 24, 2023 in settlement of the vested shares, net of tax withheld of $27 thousand.\n\nOn December 22, 2023 and December 29, 2023, 27,000 performance shares vested each date for reaching the 30-day VWAP for Tranche 2 and Tranche 3. On January 8, 2024 the Company issued a total of 39,563 shares in settlement of the vested shares, net of tax withheld of $91 thousand.\n\nF-17  \n---  \n  \nOn March 11, 2024, 27,000 performance shares vested each date for reaching the 30-day VWAP for Tranche 4. The Company issued a total of 20,669 shares on March 13, 2024 in settlement of the vested shares, net of tax withheld of $46 thousand.\n\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company granted an aggregate of 39,000 restricted stock units to eleven employees under its 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. As of the grant date, assuming a 7.7% forfeiture rate based on expected turnover across the three years, the aggregate value of the restricted stock units is $258 thousand which will be amortized across the three-year period on a straight-line basis. The restricted stock units will vest at a rate of 33.33% annually on the anniversary date of the grant and any unvested restricted stock units will be forfeited if employment terminates prior to the relevant vesting date. On June 4, 2024 there was an additional grant of 500 restricted stock units to one employee with a fair value of $4 thousand. The 500 restricted stock units will vest 100% on the anniversary date of the grant and will be forfeited if employment terminates prior to the relevant vesting date.\n\nOn May 1, 2024, there were 12,000 shares vested under its 2023 Equity Incentive Plan for restricted stock units granted on May 1, 2023. On May 3, 2024, 8,446 shares were issued to ten employees, withheld of $26 thousand.\n\nOn May 17, 2024, 27,000 performance shares vested for reaching the 30-day VWAP for Tranche 5. The Company issued a total of 20,426 shares on May 17, 2024 in settlement of the vested shares, net of tax withheld of $53 thousand.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were no performance shares remaining to vest.\n\nThe assumptions and results for the Monte Carlo simulation are as follows:\n\nSchedule of Assumptions and Results for the Monte Carlo Simulation\n\nAssumptions  \n---  \nPerformance Period Start | 10/2/2023  \nPerformance Period End | 10/1/2028  \nTerm of simulation _(1)_ | 5.42 years  \nTime steps in simulation | 1,365  \nTime steps per year | 252  \nCommon share price at valuation date _(2)_ | $| 3.04  \nVolatility (annual) _(4)_ | 50.0| %  \nRisk-free rate (annual) _(5)_ | 3.37| %  \nCost of equity _(6)_ | 11.5| %  \nDividend yield _(3)_ | 0.0| %  \nTranche 1 | Tranche 2 | Tranche 3 | Tranche 4 | Tranche 5  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nNumber of performance shares in the Tranche _(1)_ | 27,000 | 27,000 | 27,000 | 27,000 | 27,000  \nFair Value of One Performance share _(7)_ | $| 2.75 | $| 2.58 | $| 2.39 | $| 2.18 | $| 1.93  \nTotal Fair Value of Tranche | $| 74,345 | $| 69,742 | $| 64,446 | $| 58,819 | $| 52,238  \nDerived Service Period (Years) _(7)_ | 0.71 | 1.13 | 1.60 | 2.06 | 2.48  \n_(1)_ | _Based on the terms of the Performance Shares agreement issued by the Company on May 3, 2023._  \n---|---  \n_(2)_ | _Closing price of OPXS shares on the Valuation Date, as obtained via S &P Capital IQ._  \n---|---  \n_(3)_ | _Expected dividends provided by management._  \n---|---  \n_(4)_ | _Based on historical volatility of OPXS and comparable public companies._  \n---|---  \n_(5)_ | _Interest rate for US Treasury commensurate with the Performance Shares holding period, as of the Valuation Date, as obtained via S &P Capital IQ._  \n---|---  \n_(6)_ | _Estimated cost of equity for OPXS as of the Valuation Date._  \n---|---  \n_(7)_ | _Based on Monte Carlo simulation._  \n---|---  \n  \nF-18  \n---  \n  \n**Stock Based Compensation Expense**\n\nEquity compensation is amortized based on a straight-line basis across the vesting or service period as applicable.

(collectively, the “Company”), entered into an asset purchase agreement and a contract manufacturing agreement with RUB Aluminum s.r.o. (“RUB”). Under the agreements, the Company acquired certain intellectual property and technical and marketing information relating to the Speedtracker Mach product line, which is primarily used for firearm projectile speed detection, measuring and tracking. RUB may continue to manufacture Speedtracker Mach products on behalf of the Company. The Company acquired the assets using $1 million in cash on hand, with potential additional future cash payments based on successful completion of defined milestones. The initial term of the contract manufacturing agreement is one year, subject to additional one-year renewal terms to which both parties must agree. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company has determined it would be more economical to move the manufacturing operations in house and is no longer ordering assembled units against the contract manufacturing agreement.\n\nThe acquisition included transaction costs of $30 thousand for legal fees. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, the total earnout payment would have been $238 thousand only if the earnout revenue milestones were achieved during the earnout period, otherwise the earnout would be zero. As of January 18, 2024, the fair value of the contingent liability was $83 thousand. As of June 30, 2024, it was determined that the revenue milestones related to the earnout agreement would be unachievable within the earnout period and the fair value of the contingent liability related to the earnout was set to zero.\n\nThe intangible asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over seven years and reviewed annually at each fiscal year end for possible impairment.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 the value of intangible assets is:\n\nSchedule of the Value of Intangible Assets\n\nJune 30, 2024  \n---  \nIntangible Assets – Intellectual Property | $| 1,030  \nAmortization of Intangible Assets | (61| )  \nNet Intangible Assets | $| 969  \n  \nF-19  \n---  \n  \n**Note 8 - Stockholders’ Equity**\n\n**Dividends**\n\nNo dividends were declared or paid during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 or the twelve months ended October 1, 2023.\n\n**Common Stock**\n\nOn September 22, 2021, the Company announced authorization of a $1 million stock repurchase program. The shares authorized to be repurchased under the repurchase program may be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market transactions or in negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and subject to Rule 10b-18 as promulgated by the SEC.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended July 2, 2023 and June 30, 2024, there were zero common shares repurchased under the program.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued 20,426 and 101,718 shares to Danny Schoening and Karen Hawkins in settlement of 27,000 and 135,000 performance shares, which vested during the three and nine months, respectively. The shares were issued net of 6,574 and 33,282 shares withheld for taxes. \n\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued 8,446 shares to ten employees in settlement of 12,000 restricted stock units, which vested during the three and nine months. The shares were issued net of 3,554 shares withheld for taxes.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, total outstanding common shares were 6,873,234 and 6,763,070, respectively.\n\n**Note 9 - Subsequent Events**\n\nThere are none.\n\nF-20  \n---  \n  \n**Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**\n\n_This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD &A) is intended to supplement and complement our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). You are encouraged to review our consolidated financial statements in conjunction with your review of this MD&A. The financial information in this MD&A has been prepared in accordance with GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. In addition, we use non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental indicators of our operating performance and financial position. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for comparing actual results from one period to another, as well as for planning purposes. We will also report non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information, as we believe their use provides more insight into our performance. When a non-GAAP measure is used in this MD&A, it is clearly identified as a non-GAAP measure and reconciled to the most closely corresponding GAAP measure._\n\n_The following discussion highlights the principal factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described. The operating results for the periods presented were not significantly affected by inflation._\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information**\n\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in particular the MD&A, contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Any statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other reports, statements, and information we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”), in our press releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, or in oral statements made by or with the approval of an executive officer, the words or phrases “believes,” “may,” “will,” “expects,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “will likely result,” “estimates,” “projects” or similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements represent our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies concerning future events, including, but not limited to, any statements regarding growth strategy; product and development programs; financial performance and financial condition (including revenue, net income, profit margins and working capital); orders and backlog; expected timing of contract deliveries to customers and corresponding revenue recognition; increases in the cost of materials and labor; costs remaining to fulfill contracts; contract loss reserves; labor shortages; follow-on orders; supply chain challenges; the continuation of historical trends; the sufficiency of our cash balances for future liquidity and capital resource needs; the expected impact of changes in accounting policies on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows; anticipated problems and our plans for future operations; and the economy in general or the future of the defense industry.\n\nWe caution that these statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control, and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of important factors. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, continued funding of defense programs and military spending, the timing of such funding, general economic and business conditions, including unforeseen weakness in the Company’s markets, effects of continued geopolitical unrest and regional conflicts, competition, changes in technology and methods of marketing, delays in completing engineering and manufacturing programs, changes in customer order patterns, changes in product mix, continued success in technological advances and delivering technological innovations, changes in the U.S. Government’s interpretation of federal procurement rules and regulations, changes in spending due to policy changes in any new federal presidential administration, market acceptance of the Company’s products, shortages in components, production delays due to performance quality issues with outsourced components, inability to fully realize the expected benefits from acquisitions and restructurings or delays in realizing such benefits, challenges in integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated synergies, changes to export regulations, increases in tax rates, changes to generally accepted accounting principles, difficulties in retaining key employees and customers, unanticipated costs under fixed-price service and system integration engagements, changes in the market for microcap stocks regardless of growth and value and various other factors beyond our control. Some of these risks and uncertainties are identified in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the section “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and you are urged to review those sections. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete list of all potential risks or uncertainties.\n\n1  \n---  \n  \nWe do not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. You should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n**Background**\n\nOptex Systems Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our) manufactures optical sighting systems and assemblies, primarily for Department of Defense applications. Its products are installed on various types of U.S. military land vehicles, such as the Abrams and Bradley fighting vehicles, light armored and armored security vehicles and have been selected for installation on the Stryker family of vehicles. We also manufacture and deliver numerous periscope configurations, rifle and surveillance sights and night vision optical assemblies. Our products consist primarily of build-to-customer print products that are delivered both directly to the armed services and to other defense prime contractors. Less than 1% of today’s revenue is related to the resale of products substantially manufactured by others. In this case, the product would likely be a simple replacement part of a larger system previously produced by us.\n\nWe are both a prime and sub-prime contractor to the Department of Defense. Sub-prime contracts are typically issued through major defense contractors such as General Dynamics Land Systems, Raytheon Corp., BAE Systems plc, ADS Inc. and others. We are also a military supplier to foreign governments such as Israel, Australia and South American countries and as a subcontractor for several large U.S. defense companies serving foreign governments.\n\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation is the principal set of regulations that govern the acquisition process of government agencies and contracts with the U.S. government. In general, parts of the Federal Acquisition Regulation are incorporated into government solicitations and contracts by reference as terms and conditions effecting contract awards and pricing solicitations _._\n\nMany of our contracts are prime or subcontracted directly with the Federal government and, as such, are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 49.5, “Contract Termination Clauses” and more specifically Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses 52.249-2 “Termination for Convenience of the Government (Fixed-Price)”, and 49.504 “Termination of fixed-price contracts for default”. These clauses are standard clauses on our prime military contracts and generally apply to us as subcontractors. It has been our experience that the termination for convenience is rarely invoked, except where it is mutually beneficial for both parties. We are currently not aware of any pending terminations for convenience or for default on our existing contracts.\n\nIn the event a termination for convenience were to occur, Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.249-2 provides for full recovery of all contractual costs and profits reasonably occurred up to and as a result of the terminated contract. In the event a termination for default were to occur, we could be liable for any excess cost incurred by the government to acquire supplies from another supplier similar to those terminated from us. We would not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Company as defined by Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.249-8.\n\nIn addition, some of our contracts allow for government contract financing in the form of contract progress payments pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.232-16, “Progress Payments”. As a small business, and subject to certain limitations, this clause provides for government payment of up to 90% of incurred program costs prior to product delivery. To the extent our contracts allow for progress payments, we intend to utilize this benefit, thereby minimizing the working capital impact on us for materials and labor required to complete the contracts.\n\n2  \n---  \n  \n**Recent Events**\n\n**_January 2024 Asset Acquisition_**\n\nOn January 18, 2024, we entered into an asset purchase agreement and a contract manufacturing agreement with RUB Aluminium s.r.o. (“RUB”). Under the agreements, the Company acquired certain intellectual property and technical and marketing information relating to the Speedtracker Mach product line, which is primarily used for firearm projectile speed detection, measuring and tracking. RUB will continue to manufacture Speedtracker Mach products on behalf of the Company. The Company acquired the assets using $1 million in cash on hand, with potential additional future cash payments based on successful completion of defined milestones. The initial term of the contract manufacturing agreement is one year, subject to additional one-year renewal terms to which both parties must agree. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company has determined it would be more economical to move the manufacturing operations in house and is no longer ordering assembled units against the contract manufacturing agreement.\n\nThe acquisition included transaction costs of $30 thousand for legal fees and a contingent liability for payment against an earnout agreement based on meeting certain revenue milestones. As of June 30, 2024, the fair value of the contingent liability was zero. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, the total earnout payment will be $238 thousand only if the earnout revenue milestone is achieved during the earnout period, otherwise the earnout will be zero. As of June 30, 2024 the Company determined the likelihood of achieving the revenue milestone during the earnout period was highly unlikely. The asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a seven-year period.\n\n**Material Trends**\n\nRecent supply chain disruptions have strained our suppliers and extended supplier delivery lead times, affecting our ability to sustain operations. We anticipate market wide material shortages for paint and resin products as well as critical epoxies and chemicals used in our manufacturing process. In addition, we have seen substantial increases in the costs of aluminum, steel and acrylic commodities, which has affected our net income in the year ended October 1, 2023 and the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, and is expected to continue to have a negative effect on the margins expected to be generated under our long-term fixed contracts over the next two years. See also “ _Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business_ - _Certain of our products are dependent on specialized sources of supply potentially subject to disruption which could have a material, adverse impact on our business” in our_ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2023.\n\nWe have also experienced significant material shortages during the year ended October 1, 2023 and extending into the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 from several significant suppliers of our periscope covers and housings. These shortages affect several of our periscope products at the Optex Richardson segment. The delays in key components, combined with labor shortages during the year ended October 1, 2023 and continuing into the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, have negatively impacted our production levels and continue to push back expected delivery dates. We are actively seeking alternative sources as well as expediting our current suppliers for these components. We are also increasing employee recruitment initiatives and overtime to attempt to mitigate any continuing risks to the periscope line.\n\nWe are seeing some recent improvements in the local labor market and are adding to our direct labor force in concert with improvements in our supplier delivery performance. While we are encouraged by improvements in supplier performance for the Optex Richardson segment periscope line which yielded increased revenue performance during fiscal year 2023 and into the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we have yet to ramp up deliveries sufficiently to keep pace with our current customer demands. As such, we cannot give any assurances that expected customer delivery dates for our periscope products will not experience further delays.\n\nIn March 2023, we moved our line of credit from PNC Bank to Texas Capital Bank and increased our available line of credit to $3.0 million from the previous $2.0 million line with PNC. The increase in credit limit helps us meet our working capital requirements in light of the increased backlog and delay of revenues from the fiscal year 2023.\n\nWe refer also to “ _Item 1. Business – Market Opportunity: U.S. Military_ ” _in our_ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2023 for a description of current trends in U.S. government military spending and its potential impact on Optex, which may be material, including particularly the tables included in that section and disclosure on the significant reduction in spending for U.S. ground system military programs, which has a direct impact on the Optex Richardson segment revenue, all of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n3  \n---  \n  \n**Results of Operations**\n\n**_Non-GAAP Ad justed EBITDA_**\n\nWe use adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) as an additional measure for evaluating the performance of our business as “net income” includes the significant impact of noncash compensation expenses related to equity stock grants, as well as depreciation, amortization, interest expenses and federal income taxes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance because it permits period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before the excluded items, which we do not consider relevant to our operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. This non-GAAP measure excludes certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative measure.\n\nThe table below summarizes our three-and nine-month operating results for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023, in terms of both the GAAP net income measure and the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA measure. We believe that including both measures allows the reader better to evaluate our overall performance.\n\n(Thousands)  \n---  \nThree months ended | Nine months ended  \nJune 30, 2024 | July 2, 2023 | June 30, 2024 | July 2, 2023  \nNet Income (GAAP) | $| 1,261 | $| 576 | $| 2,754 | $| 832  \nAdd:  \nFederal Income Tax Expense | 337 | 154 | 737 | 223  \nDepreciation | 132 | 86 | 341 | 252  \nStock Compensation | 90 | 81 | 360 | 134  \nInterest Expense | 17 | 22 | 32 | 31  \nAdjusted EBITDA - Non GAAP | $| 1,837 | $| 919 | $| 4,224 | $| 1,472  \n  \nOur net income increased by $0.7 million to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to net income of $0.6 million for the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA increased by $0.9 million to $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $0.9 million for the prior year period.\n\nOur net income increased by $1.9 million to $2.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to a net income of $0.8 million for the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.7 million to $4.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $1.5 million for the prior year period.\n\nThe increase in the most recent three and nine-month period net income and adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by increased revenue and gross profit, which was only partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses.

For the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our total revenues increased by $7.0 million, or 39.6%, compared to the prior year period. The increase in revenue for the three and nine-month periods was driven by increased customer demand for military products across both operating segments partially offset by lower customer demand in commercial optical assemblies.\n\nConsolidated gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $1.2 million, or 68.3%, compared to the prior year period. Consolidated gross profit for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $3.1 million, or 78.8%, compared to the prior year period. The increase in the most recent three and nine-month period’s gross margin was primarily attributable to higher revenue spread across a fixed manufacturing cost base combined with changes in product mix and improved pricing and operating performance in both operating segments.\n\nOur operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $0.9 million, or 114.8%, compared to the prior year period. Our operating income for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $2.4 million, or 224.4%, compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating income for the three and nine-month periods was primarily driven by higher revenue and increased gross margin in both operating segments.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \n**_New Orders and Backlog_**\n\nProduct backlog represents the value of unfulfilled customer manufacturing orders yet to be recognized as revenue. While backlog is not a non-GAAP financial measure, it is also not defined by GAAP. Therefore, our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies. The booked backlog by period may also not be fully indicative of the predicted revenues for those periods as many of our orders provide for accelerated delivery without penalty and may additionally provide customers the option to adjust schedules to meet their most recent projected demand quantities. However, we provide customer order and backlog information as we believe it provides significant insight into forward demand, with some predictive power to short term future revenues.\n\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company booked $28.3 million in new orders, representing a 7.6% increase over the prior year period. The orders for the most recently completed nine months consist of $18.5 million for our Optex Richardson segment and $9.8 million attributable to the Applied Optics Center segment.\n\nThe following table depicts the new customer orders for the nine months ending June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period in millions of dollars:\n\n(Millions)  \n---  \nProduct Line | Nine months ended June 30, 2024 | Nine months ended July 2, 2023 | Variance | % Chg  \nPeriscopes | $| 15.9 | $| 11.6 | $| 4.3 | 37.1| %  \nSighting Systems | 0.3 | 4.0 | (3.7| ) | (92.5| )%  \nHowitzer | - | - | - | -| %  \nOther | 2.3 | 3.0 | (0.7| ) | (23.3| )%  \nOptex Systems – Richardson | 18.5 | 18.6 | (0.1| ) | (0.5| )%  \nOptical Assemblies | 1.8 | 1.2 | 0.6 | 50.0| %  \nLaser Filters | 6.5 | 5.5 | 1.0 | 18.2| %  \nDay Windows | 0.1 | 0.1 | - | -| %  \nOther | 1.4 | 0.9 | 0.5 | 55.6| %  \nApplied Optics Center – Dallas | 9.8 | 7.7 | 2.1 | 27.3| %  \nTotal Customer Orders | $| 28.3 | $| 26.3 | $| 2.0 | 7.6| %  \n  \nDuring the current year nine-month period ended June 30, 2024, orders in the Company’s Optex Richardson segment decreased by ($0.1) million, or (0.5%) as compared to the prior year period. The primary reason for the decrease relates to a prior year award for $3.4 million in sighting systems to repair and refurbish night vision equipment for the Government of Israel. We began shipments against the contract in December 2023. The decrease in orders for sighting systems and other products was offset by a significant increase in periscope orders in the current year nine-month period. The Applied Optics Center orders increased $2.1 million, or 27.3% as we continue to see increases in orders for laser filter units for several prime government contractors, in addition to an increase in customer orders for commercial optical assemblies and other products driven by our new program of Infrared (IR) Signature Reduction Coatings used on aircraft. \n\n7  \n---  \n  \nBacklog as of June 30, 2024 was $45.6 million. This compares to a backlog of $41.8 million as of October 1, 2023, representing an increase of $3.8 million, or 9.1%, and a backlog of $41.6 million as of July 2, 2023, representing an increase of $4.0 million, or 9.6%.

Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on July 8, 2024, the Company announced a $2.5 million order for laser filter units to be delivered from August 2024 through July 2025.\n\nPlease refer to “ _Material Trends_ ” above and “ _Liquidity and Capital Resources_ ” below for more information on recent developments and trends with respect to our orders and backlog, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nThe Company continues to pursue domestic, international and commercial opportunities in addition to maintaining its current footprint with U.S. vehicle manufactures, with existing as well as new product lines. We are also reviewing potential products outside our traditional product lines, which could be manufactured using our current production facilities in order to capitalize on our existing excess capacity.\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended July 2, 2023**\n\n_Revenue_. For the three months ended June 30 2024, revenue increased by $1.9 million or 26.3% compared to the prior year period as set forth in the table below:\n\nThree months ended  \n---  \n(Thousands)  \nProduct Line | June 30, 2024 | July 2, 2023 | Variance | % Chg  \nPeriscopes | $| 3,171 | $| 2,623 | $| 548 | 20.9| %  \nSighting Systems | 432 | 137 | 295 | 215.3| %  \nHowitzers | - | - | - | -  \nOther | 1,072 | 309 | 763 | 246.9| %  \nOptex Richardson | 4,675 | 3,069 | 1,606 | 52.3| %  \nOptical Assemblies | 963 | 1,452 | (489| ) | (33.7| )%  \nLaser Filters | 2,941 | 2,286 | 655 | 28.7| %  \nDay Windows | 109 | 120 | (11| ) | (9.2| )%  \nOther | 372 | 245 | 127 | 51.8| %  \nApplied Optics Center - Dallas | 4,385 | 4,103 | 282 | 6.9| %  \nTotal Revenue | $| 9,060 | $| 7,172 | $| 1,888 | 26.3| %  \n  \n8  \n---  \n  \nOptex Richardson revenue increased by $1.6 million or 52.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period on higher customer demand for periscopes, sighting systems and other products including collimators, cell assemblies, and spare parts.\n\nApplied Optics Center revenue increased by $0.3 million or 6.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. The revenue increase is primarily attributable to increased customer demand for laser filters and other products driven by our new program of Infrared (IR) Signature Reduction Coatings used on aircraft partially offset by lower customer demand for commercial optical assemblies.\n\n_Gross Margin_. The gross margin during the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 was 31.8% of revenue as compared to a gross margin of 23.9% of revenue for the prior year period. The increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to higher revenue, changes in product mix, and increased absorption of fixed overhead across a higher revenue mix. Cost of sales increased to $6.2 million for the current period as compared to the prior year period of $5.5 million on higher revenue.\n\n_G &A Expenses_. During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023, we recorded operating expenses of $1.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Operating expenses increased by 31.9% between the respective periods primarily due to increased spending on royalties, selling expenses, investor relations, IT support services and legal expenses.\n\n_Operating Income_. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded operating income of $1.6 million, as compared to operating income of $0.8 million during the three months ended July 2, 2023. The $0.8 million increase in operating income for the current year period from the prior year period is primarily due to increased revenue and gross margin, partially offset by higher general and administrative spending.\n\n**Nine months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine months Ended July 2, 2023**\n\n_Revenue_. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024, revenues increased by $7.0 million or 39.6% compared to the prior year period as set forth in the table below:\n\nNine months ended  \n---  \n(Thousands)  \nProduct Line | June 30, 2024 | July 2, 2023 | Variance | % Chg  \nPeriscopes | $| 7,842 | $| 6,085 | $| 1,757 | 28.9| %  \nSighting Systems | 1,003 | 464 | 539 | 116.2| %  \nHowitzers | - | - | - | -  \nOther | 3,499 | 1,193 | 2,306 | 193.3| %  \nOptex Systems - Richardson | 12,344 | 7,742 | 4,602 | 59.4| %  \nOptical Assemblies | 3,252 | 4,438 | (1,186| ) | (26.7| )%  \nLaser Filters | 7,208 | 4,404 | 2,804 | 63.7| %  \nDay Windows | 460 | 350 | 110 | 31.4| %  \nOther | 1,288 | 648 | 640 | 98.8| %  \nApplied Optics Center - Dallas | 12,208 | 9,840 | 2,368 | 24.1| %  \nTotal Revenue | $| 24,552 | $| 17,582 | $| 6,970 | 39.6| %  \n  \nOptex Richardson revenue increased by $4.6 million or 59.4% for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period on higher customer demand for periscopes, sighting systems and other products including collimators, cell assemblies, and spare parts.\n\nApplied Optics Center revenue increased by $2.4 million or 24.1% for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. The revenue increase is primarily attributable to increased customer demand for laser filters and other products driven by our new program of Infrared (IR) Signature Reduction Coatings used on aircraft partially offset by lower customer demand for commercial optical assemblies.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n_Gross Margin_. The gross margin during the nine-month period ended June 30, 2024 was 29.0% as compared to a gross margin of 22.7% for the prior year period. The increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to higher revenue, changes in product mix, and increased absorption of fixed overhead across a higher revenue mix. Cost of sales increased to $17.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period of $13.6 million on higher revenue.\n\n_G &A Expenses_. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023, we recorded operating expenses of $3.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Operating expenses increased by 24.2% between the respective periods primarily due to increased spending on labor, stock compensation, royalties, selling expenses, investor relations and IT support services.\n\n_Operating Income_. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded operating income of $3.5 million, as compared to an operating income of $1.1 million during the nine months ended July 2, 2023. The $2.4 million increase in operating income is primarily due to increased revenue and gross margin, partially offset by higher general and administrative spending.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of $14.2 million, as compared to $13.5 million as of October 1, 2023.\n\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, we generated operating cash of $1.0 million, and spent $1.5 million on acquisitions of equipment and intangible assets. During the period, our inventory increased $3.0 million in support of new program awards, higher backlog and increasing revenues anticipated over the next twelve months.\n\nThe Company has capital commitments of $0.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment consisting of a significant coating chamber upgrade, an Opotek tunable laser system and a laser engraving machine.\n\nBacklog as of June 30, 2024 was $45.6 million as compared to backlog of $41.6 million as of July 2, 2023 and $41.8 million as of October 1, 2023, representing an increase of 9.6% and 9.1%, respectively. For further details, see “ _Results of Operations – New Orders and Backlog_ ” above.\n\nThe Company has historically funded its operations through cash from operations, convertible notes, common and preferred stock offerings and bank debt. The Company’s ability to generate positive cash flows depends on a variety of factors, including the continued development and successful marketing of the Company’s products.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, the Company had $0.5 million in cash and an outstanding payable balance of $1.0 million against its line of credit. At June 30, 2024, our outstanding accounts receivable balance was $3.3 million. We expect the accounts to be collected during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nWe refer to the disclosure under _“Material Trends”_ with respect to recent supply chain disruptions and material shortages, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nIn the short term, the Company plans to utilize its current cash, available line of credit and operating cash flow to fund inventory purchases in support of the backlog growth and higher anticipated revenue during the next twelve months. Short term cash in excess of our working capital needs may be also be used to fund the purchase of product lines and other assets, including property and equipment required to maintain or meet our growing backlog, in addition to repurchasing common stock against our current stock repurchase plan. Longer term, excess cash beyond our operating needs may be used to fund new product development, company or product line acquisitions, or additional stock purchases as attractive opportunities present themselves.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, the Company acquired certain intellectual property and technical and marketing information relating to the Speedtracker Mach product line and entered into an asset purchase agreement and a contract manufacturing agreement with RUB Aluminium s.r.o. (“RUB”). The Company acquired the assets using $1 million in cash on hand, with potential additional future cash payments based on successful completion of defined milestones. The initial term of the contract manufacturing agreement is one year, subject to additional one-year renewal terms.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \nThe acquisition included transaction costs of $30 thousand for legal fees. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, the total earnout payment will be $238 thousand only if the earnout revenue milestone is achieved during the earnout period, otherwise the earnout will be zero. As of June 30, 2024, it was determined that the earnout revenue milestone was unlikely to be achieved during the earnout period and the fair value of the contingent liability was zero. The asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a seven-year period.\n\nIn some instances, new government contract awards may allow for contract financing in the form of progress payments pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.232-16, “Progress Payments.” Subject to certain limitations, this clause provides for government payment of up to 90% of incurred program costs prior to product delivery for small businesses like us. To the extent any contracts allow for progress payments and the respective contracts would result in significant preproduction cash requirements for design, process development, tooling, material or other resources which could exceed our current working capital or line of credit availability, we intend to utilize this benefit to minimize any potential negative impact on working capital prior to receipt of payment for the associated contract deliveries. Currently none of our existing contracts allow for progress payments.\n\nWe refer to “ _Note 4 – Commitments and Contingencies – Non-cancellable Operating Leases_ ” for a tabular depiction of our remaining minimum lease and estimated CAM payments under such leases as of June 30, 2024, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nThe Company expects to generate net income and positive cash flow from operating activities over the next twelve months. To achieve and retain profitability, we need to maintain a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. Management intends to manage operations commensurate with its level of working capital and line of credit during the next twelve months and beyond; however, uneven revenue levels driven by changes in customer delivery demands, first article inspection requirements or other program delays associated with the pandemic, labor shortages and supply chain issues could create a working capital shortfall. In the event the Company does not successfully implement its ultimate business plan, certain assets may not be recoverable.\n\nOn March 22, 2023, we entered into a Business Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Texas Capital Bank (the “Lender”), pursuant to which the Lender will make available to the Borrowers a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of $3 million (the “Credit Facility”). The commitment period for advances under the Credit Facility is twenty-six months expiring on May 22, 2025. We refer to the expiration of that time period as the “Maturity Date.” Outstanding advances under the Credit Facility will accrue interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus a specified margin, subject to a specified floor interest rate. The interest rate is currently at 8.07% per annum.\n\nThe Loan Agreement contains customary events of default (including a 25% change in ownership) and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes (including changes in management), investments, and restricted payments (including cash dividends). The Loan Agreement also requires the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 and a total leverage ratio of 3.00:1. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the operating assets of the Borrowers as collateral. The Borrowers’ obligations under the Credit Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement further provides for a $125,000 Letter of Credit sublimit. As of June 30, 2024, there was $1.0 million borrowed under the Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2024, the Company is in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.\n\nThe Credit Facility replaced the prior $2 million line of credit with PNC Bank, National Association.\n\nOn September 22, 2021 the Company announced authorization for an additional $1 million stock repurchase program. As of June 30, 2024, there was an authorized balance of $560 thousand remaining to be spent against the repurchase program. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, there were no stock repurchases against the plan.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n**Critical Accounting Estimates**\n\nA critical accounting estimate is an estimate that:\n\n● | is made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,  \n---|---  \n● | involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty, and  \n---|---  \n● | has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operation.  \n---|---  \n  \nOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. These policies are described in “Critical Policies and Accounting Pronouncements” and Note 2 (Accounting Policies) to consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2023.\n\nOur critical accounting estimates include warranty costs, contract losses and the deferred tax asset valuation. Future warranty costs are based on the estimated cost of replacement for expected returns based upon our most recent experience rate of defects as a percentage of warranty covered sales. Our warranty covered sales primarily include the Applied Optics Center optical assemblies. While our warranty period is 12 months, our reserve balances assume a general 90-day return period for optical assemblies previously delivered plus any returned backlog in-house that has not yet been repaired or replaced to our customer. If our actual warranty returns should significantly exceed our historical rates on new customer products, significant production changes, or substantial customer changes to the 90-day turn-around times on returned goods, the impact could be material to our operating profit. We have not experienced any significant changes to our warranty trends in the preceding three years and do not anticipate any significant impacts in the near term. We monitor the actual warranty costs incurred to the expected values on a quarterly basis and adjust our estimates accordingly. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had accrued warranty costs of $36 thousand, as compared to $75 thousand as of October 1, 2023. The primary reason for the $39 thousand decrease in reserve balances relates to lower sales of commercial optical assemblies in combination with improved warranty return trends during the nine-month period.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, we had $101 thousand, and $243 thousand, respectively, of contract loss reserves included in our balance sheet accrued expenses. These loss contracts are related to some of our older legacy periscope IDIQ contracts which were priced in 2018 through early 2020, prior to COVID-19 and the significant downturn in defense spending on ground system vehicles. Due to inflationary price increases on component parts and higher internal manufacturing costs (as a result of escalating labor costs and higher burden rates on reduced volume), some of these contracts are in a loss condition, or at marginal profit rates. These contracts are typically three-year IDIQ contracts with two optional award years, and as such, we are obligated to accept new task awards against these contracts until the contract expiration. One of these long-term contracts has an option year ordering period ending in February 2025 with deliveries that may extend into February 2026. Should contract costs continue to increase above the negotiated selling price, or in the event the customer should release substantial quantities against these existing loss contracts, the losses could be material. For contracts currently in a loss status based on the estimated per unit contract costs, losses are booked immediately on new task order awards. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain on changes in estimates for the contract loss reserves of $16 thousand and $45 thousand and applied reserves of $34 thousand $97 thousand to cost of sales against revenues booked during the periods, respectively. There is no way to reasonably estimate future inflationary impacts, or customer awards on the existing loss contracts.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the Company had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of ($0.8) million against deferred tax assets of $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, for a net deferred tax asset of $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our deferred tax assets decreased by $0.1 million related to temporary tax adjustments. The valuation allowance has been established due to historical losses resulting in a Net Operating Loss Carryforward for each of the fiscal years 2011 through 2016 which may not be fully recognized due to an IRS Section 382 limitation related to a change in control.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**Item 3.

Controls and Procedures**\n\n_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_\n\nAs of the end of the period covered by our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, management performed, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.

(together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “Optex Systems Holdings,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) manufactures optical sighting systems and\nassemblies for the U.S. Department of Defense, foreign military applications and commercial markets. Its products are installed on a variety of U.S. military land vehicles, such\nas the Abrams and Bradley fighting vehicles, light armored and advanced security vehicles, and have been selected for installation on the Stryker family of vehicles. The\nCompany also manufactures and delivers numerous periscope configurations, rifle and surveillance sights and night vision optical assemblies. Optex Systems Holdings’\nproducts consist primarily of build to customer print products that are delivered both directly to the military and to other defense prime contractors or commercial customers.\nThe Company’s consolidated revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 were derived from the U.S. government (19%), three major U.S. defense contractors (24%, 8%,\nand 7%, respectively), one major commercial customer (15%) and all other customers (27%). Approximately 94% of the total company revenue is generated from domestic\ncustomers and 6% is derived from foreign customers, primarily in Canada and Israel. Optex Systems Holdings’ operations are based in Dallas and Richardson, Texas in leased\nfacilities comprising 93,967 square feet. As of June 30, 2024, Optex Systems Holdings operated with 122 full-time equivalent employees.\nNote 2 - Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nPrinciples of Consolidation: The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Optex Systems, Inc. All\nsignificant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements of Optex Systems Holdings included herein have been prepared by Optex Systems Holdings, without audit, pursuant to the\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in\nconjunction with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the\ndisclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the\nOptex Systems Holdings’ Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2023 and other reports filed with the SEC.\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature which are, in the opinion of\nmanagement, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Optex Systems Holdings for the interim periods presented. The results of\noperations for these periods are not necessarily comparable to, or indicative of, results of any other interim period or for the fiscal year taken as a whole. Certain information\nthat is not required for interim financial reporting purposes has been omitted.\nInventory: As of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, inventory included:\n(Thousands)\nJune 30, 2024 October 1, 2023\nRaw Material $ 9,302 $ 8,211\nWork in Process 6,164 4,460\nFinished Goods 659 489\nGross Inventory $ 16,125 $ 13,160\nLess: Inventory Reserves (1,007) (1,007)\nNet Inventory $ 15,118 $ 12,153\nF-6\nConcentration of Credit Risk: The Company’s accounts receivables as of June 30, 2024 consisted of U.S. government agencies (14%), five major U.S. defense contractors\n(22%, 11%, 11%, 10%, and 6%, respectively), one commercial customer (12%) and all other customers (14%). The Company does not believe that this concentration results in\nundue credit risk because of the financial strength of the customers and the Company’s long history with these customers.\nAccrued Warranties: The Company accrues product warranty liabilities based on the historical return rate against period shipments as they occur and reviews and adjusts these\naccruals quarterly for any significant changes in estimated costs or return rates. The accrued warranty liability includes estimated costs to repair or replace returned warranty\nbacklog units currently in-house plus estimated costs for future warranty returns that may be incurred against warranty covered products previously shipped as of the period end\ndate. As of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the Company had warranty reserve balances of $36 thousand and $75 thousand, respectively.\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nJune 30, 2024 July 2, 2023 June 30, 2024 July 2, 2023\nBeginning balance $ 69 $ 266 $ 75 $ 169\nIncurred costs for warranties satisfied during the period (15) (82) (52) (99)\nWarranty Expenses:\nWarranties reserved for new product shipped during the\nperiod(1) 26 57 90 177\nChange in estimate for pre-existing warranty liabilities(2) (44) - (77) (6)\n(Reversal of) Warranty Expense (18) 57 13 171\nEnding balance $ 36 $ 241 $ 36 $ 241\n(1) Warranty expenses accrued to cost of sales (based on current period shipments and historical warranty return rate.)\nChanges in estimated warranty liabilities recognized in cost of sales associated with: the period end customer returned warranty backlog, or the actual costs of\n(2)\nrepaired/replaced warranty units which were shipped to the customer during the current period.\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments: Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as\nof the financial statement presentation date.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are carried at, or approximate, fair value as of the reporting date\nbecause of their short-term nature. The credit facility is reported at fair value as it bears market rates of interest.\nThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and\ndisclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions.\nF-7\nThe accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. An asset or\nliability’s level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value estimates are reviewed at the origination date and again at each\napplicable measurement date and interim or annual financial reporting dates, as applicable for the financial instrument, and are based upon certain market assumptions and\npertinent information available to management at those times.\nRevenue Recognition: The majority of the Company’s contracts and customer orders originate with fixed determinable unit prices for each deliverable quantity of goods\ndefined by the customer order line item (performance obligation) and include the specific due date for the transfer of control and title of each of those deliverables to the\ncustomer at pre-established payment terms, which are generally within thirty to sixty days from the transfer of title and control. We have elected to account for shipping and\nhandling costs as fulfillment costs after the customer obtains control of the goods. In addition, the Company has one ongoing service contract which relates to optimized\nweapon system support (OWSS) and includes ongoing program maintenance, repairs and spare inventory support for the customer’s existing fleet units in service during the\nduration of the contract. Revenue recognition for this program has been recorded by the Company, and compensated by the customer, at fixed monthly increments over time,\nconsistent with the defined contract maintenance period. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, there was $126 thousand and $357 thousand in service contract\nrevenue. During the three and nine months ended July 2, 2023, there was $115 thousand and $340 thousand in service contract revenue.\nDuring the three- and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2024, there was $161 thousand of revenue recognized from customer deposit liabilities (deferred contract revenue).\nDuring the three- and nine-month periods ended July 2, 2023, there was zero and $223 thousand of revenue recognized from customer deposit liabilities (deferred contract\nrevenue). As of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, customer deposit liabilities were $320 thousand and $481 thousand, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, there was $250 and $336 thousand in accrued selling expenses and $237 and $336 thousand in contract assets related to a new $3.4\nmillion contract booked in November 2022. The costs will be amortized against the revenue for the contract deliveries which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and\nextend into fiscal year 2025.\nContract Loss Reserves: The Company records loss provisions in the event that the current estimated total revenue against a contract and the total estimated cost remaining to\nfulfill the contract indicate a loss upon completion. When the estimated costs indicate a loss, we record the entire value of the loss against the contract loss reserve in the period\nthe determination is made. The Company has several long-term fixed price contracts that are currently indicative of a loss condition due to recent inflationary pressures on\nmaterial and labor, combined with increased manufacturing overhead costs. One of these long-term contracts has an option year ordering period ending in February 2025 with\ndeliveries that may extend into February 2026. As of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the accrued contract loss reserves were $101 thousand and $243 thousand,\nrespectively. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain on changes in estimates for the contract loss reserves of $16 thousand and\n$45 thousand and applied reserves of $34 thousand and $97 thousand to cost of sales against revenues booked during the periods, respectively.\nIncome Tax/Deferred Tax: As of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the Company had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of ($0.8) million against deferred tax assets of\n$1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, for a net deferred tax asset of $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The valuation allowance has been established due to\nhistorical losses resulting in a Net Operating Loss Carryforward for each of the fiscal years 2011 through 2016 which may not be fully recognized due to an IRS Section 382\nlimitation related to a change in control. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our deferred tax assets decreased by $0.1 million related to temporary tax adjustments.\nEarnings per Share: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available for common shareholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of common\nshares outstanding (the denominator) for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common\nstock were exercised or converted into common stock.\nF-8\nThe Company has potentially dilutive securities outstanding, which include unvested restricted stock units and unvested shares of restricted stock. The Company uses the\nTreasury Stock Method to compute the dilutive effect of any dilutive shares. Unvested restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock that are anti-dilutive are excluded\nfrom the calculation of diluted earnings per common share.\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, 60,000 shares of unvested restricted stock and 66,500 unvested restricted stock units (which convert to an aggregate of\n88,401 and 67,434 incremental shares), respectively, were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. For the three and nine months ended July 2, 2023, 120,000\nshares of unvested restricted stock (which convert to an aggregate of 43,141 and 35,011 incremental shares), respectively, were included in the diluted earnings per share\ncalculation.\nNote 3 - Segment Reporting\nThe Company’s two reportable segments, Applied Optics Center and Optex Richardson, are strategic businesses offering similar products to similar markets and customers;\nhowever, they are operated and managed separately due to differences in manufacturing technology, equipment, geographic location, and specific product mix. Applied Optics\nCenter was acquired as a unit, and management at the time of the acquisition was retained.\nThe Applied Optics Center segment also serves as the key supplier of laser coated filters used in the production of periscope assemblies for the Optex Richardson segment.\nIntersegment sales and transfers are accounted for at annually agreed to pricing rates based on estimated segment product cost, which includes segment direct manufacturing\nand general and administrative costs, but exclude profits that would apply to third party external customers.\nOptex Richardson – Richardson, Texas\nOptex Richardson revenues are primarily in support of prime and subcontracted military customers. Military sales to prime and subcontracted customers represented\napproximately 98% and sales to commercial customers represented approximately 2% of the external segment revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. The Optex\nRichardson segment revenue is comprised of approximately 85% domestic military customers and 13% foreign military customers. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024,\nOptex Richardson represented 50% of the Company’s total consolidated revenue and consisted of revenue from the U.S. government (14%), one major U.S. defense contractor\n(21%) and all other customers (15%).\nOptex Richardson is located in Richardson Texas, with leased premises consisting of approximately 49,100 square feet. As of June 30, 2024, the Richardson facility operated\nwith 77 full-time equivalent employees in a single shift operation which includes 8 home office support employees. The facilities at Optex Richardson serve as the home office\nfor both the Optex Richardson and Applied Optics Center segments.\nApplied Optics Center (AOC) – Dallas, Texas\nThe Applied Optics Center serves primarily domestic U.S. customers. Sales to commercial customers represented approximately 29% and military sales to prime and\nsubcontracted customers represented approximately 71% of the external segment revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. Approximately 95% of the AOC revenue\nwas derived from external customers and approximately 5% was related to intersegment sales to Optex Richardson in support of military contracts. For the nine months ended\nJune 30, 2024, AOC represented 50% of the Company’s total consolidated revenue and consisted of revenue from the U.S government (5%), two major defense contractor (8%\nand 7%), one commercial customer (14%), and all other customers (16%).\nThe Applied Optics Center is located in Dallas, Texas with leased premises consisting of approximately 44,867 square feet of space. As of June 30, 2024, AOC operated with 45\nfull-time equivalent employees in a single shift operation.\nThe financial tables below present information on the reportable segments’ profit or loss for each period, as well as segment assets as of each period end.

The Company also leases certain\noffice equipment under non-cancellable operating leases.\nThe leased facility under Optex Systems located at 1420 Presidential Drive, Richardson, Texas consists of 49,100 square feet of space at the premises. The previous lease term\nfor this location expired March 31, 2021 and the monthly base rent was $24.6 thousand through March 31, 2021. On January 11, 2021 the Company executed a sixth\namendment extending the terms of the lease for eighty-six (86) months, commencing on April 1, 2021 and ending on May 31, 2028. The initial base rent is set at $25.3\nthousand and escalates 3% on April 1 each year thereafter. The initial term included 2 months of rent abatement for April and May of 2021. The monthly rent includes\napproximately $12 thousand for additional Common Area Maintenance fees and taxes (“CAM”), to be adjusted annually based on actual expenses incurred by the landlord.\nThe leased facility under the Applied Optics Center located at 9839 and 9827 Chartwell Drive, Dallas, Texas, consists of 44,867 square feet of space at the premises. The\nprevious lease term for this location expired on October 31, 2021 and the monthly base rent was $21.9 thousand through the end of the lease. On January 11, 2021 the Company\nexecuted a first amendment extending the terms of the lease for eighty-six (86) months, commencing on November 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2028. The initial base\nrent is set at $23.6 thousand as of January 1, 2022 and escalates 2.75% on January 1 each year thereafter. The initial term includes two months of rent abatement for November\nand December of 2021. The amendment provides for a five-year renewal option at the end of the lease term at the greater of the then “prevailing rental rate” or the then current\nbase rental rate. Our obligations to make payments under the lease are secured by a $125,000 standby letter of credit. The monthly rent includes approximately $13 thousand\nfor additional CAM, to be adjusted annually based on actual expenses incurred by the landlord.\nThe Company had one non-cancellable office equipment lease with a commencement date of October 1, 2018 and a term of 39 months. The lease cost for the equipment was\n$1.5 thousand per month from October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2021. The lease was renewed on November 18, 2021 for an additional 48 months at a cost of $1.2\nthousand per month. The start of the lease was delayed until April 2022 due to temporary equipment shortages. The lease renewal resulted in the recognition of an additional\nright of use asset and a lease liability of $51 thousand during the year ended October 2, 2022.\nF-12\nAs of June 30, 2024, the remaining minimum base lease and estimated common area maintenance (CAM) payments under the non-cancellable office equipment and facility\nspace leases are as follows:\nNon-cancellable Operating Leases Minimum Payments\n(Thousands)\nOptex Applied Optics Office\nRichardson Center Equipment Consolidated\nFacility Lease Facility Lease Total Lease Total Variable\nFiscal Year Payments Payments Lease Payments Payments CAM Estimate\n2024 Base year lease $ 83 $ 75 $ 4 $ 162 $ 75\n2025 Base year lease 336 305 15 656 306\n2026 Base year lease 346 313 3 662 312\n2027 Base year lease 357 322 - 679 318\n2028 Base year lease 242 330 - 572 249\n2029 Base year lease - 83 - 83 43\nTotal base lease payments $ 1,364 $ 1,428 $ 22 $ 2,814 $ 1,303\nImputed interest on lease payments (1) (130) (155) (1) (286)\nTotal Operating Lease Liability(2) $ 1,234 $ 1,273 $ 21 $ 2,528\nRight-of-use Asset(3) $ 1,146 $ 1,195 $ 21 $ 2,362\n(1) Assumes a discount borrowing rate of 5.0% on the new lease amendments effective as of January 11, 2021.\n(2) Includes $166 thousand of unamortized deferred rent.\n(3) Short-term and Long-term portion of Operating Lease Liability is $634 thousand and $1,894 thousand, respectively.\nTotal expense under both facility lease agreements for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023 was $223 and $206 thousand, respectively.

(collectively, the “Borrowers”), entered into a line of credit facility (the “PNC Facility”) with BBVA,\nUSA. In June 2021, PNC Bank completed its acquisition of BBVA, USA and the bank name changed to PNC Bank (“PNC”). The substantive terms were as follows:\n● The principal amount of the PNC Facility was $2.25 million. The PNC Facility matured on April 15, 2022. The interest rate was variable based on PNC’s Prime\nRate plus a margin of 0.250%, initially set at 3% at loan origination, and all accrued and unpaid interest was payable monthly in arrears starting on May 15, 2020;\nand the principal amount was due in full with all accrued and unpaid interest and any other fees on April 15, 2022.\n● There were commercially standard covenants including, but not limited to, covenants regarding maintenance of corporate existence, not incurring other\nindebtedness except trade debt, not changing more than 25% stock ownership of Borrowers, and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25:1, with the Fixed Charge\nCoverage Ratio defined as (earnings before taxes, amortization, depreciation, amortization and rent expense less cash taxes, distribution, dividends and fair value\nof warrants) divided by (current maturities on long term debt plus interest expense plus rent expense).\n● The PNC Facility contained commercially standard events of default including, but not limited to, not making payments when due; incurring a judgment of\n$10,000 or more not covered by insurance; not maintaining collateral and the like.\n● The PNC Facility was secured by a first lien on all of the assets of Borrowers.\nF-14\nOn April 12, 2022, the Borrowers entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the “PNC Loan Agreement”) with PNC, pursuant to which the PNC Facility was\ndecreased from $2.25 million to $1.125 million, and the maturity date was extended from April 15, 2022 to April 15, 2023. The PNC Loan Agreement required the Borrowers\nto maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.\nOn November 21, 2022, the Borrowers issued an Amended and Restated Revolving Line of Credit Note (the “Line of Credit Note”) to PNC in connection with an increase of\nthe Borrower’s revolving line of credit facility under the PNC Loan Agreement from $1.125 million to $2.0 million. The maturity date remained April 15, 2023. Obligations\noutstanding under the credit facility accrued interest at a rate equal to the Lender’s prime rate minus 0.25%.\nThe Line of Credit Note and PNC Loan Agreement contained customary events of default and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing indebtedness,\nliens, fundamental changes, investments, and restricted payments. The PNC Facility was secured by substantially all of the operating assets of the Borrowers as collateral. The\nBorrowers’ obligations under the PNC Facility were subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Line of Credit Note and PNC Loan\nAgreement.\nThe PNC Facility was replaced by the Texas Capital Facility on March 22, 2023.\nCredit Facility — Texas Capital Bank\nOn March 22, 2023, the Borrowers entered into a Business Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Texas Capital Bank (the “Lender”), pursuant to which the Lender\nwill make available to the Borrowers a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of $3 million (the “Texas Capital Facility”). The Texas Capital Facility replaced the $2\nmillion PNC Facility.\nThe commitment period for advances under the Texas Capital Facility is twenty-six months expiring on May 22, 2025. We refer to the expiration of that time period as the\n“Maturity Date.” Outstanding advances under the Texas Capital Facility will accrue interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus a specified\nmargin, subject to a specified floor interest rate. As of June 30, 2024 the interest rate was 8.07% per annum.\nThe Loan Agreement contains customary events of default (including a 25% change in ownership) and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing\nindebtedness, liens, fundamental changes (including changes in management), investments, and restricted payments (including cash dividends). The Loan Agreement also\nrequires the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 and a total leverage ratio of 3.00:1.

The stock price at grant date\nwas $1.32 per share. Effective December 1, 2021, the vesting terms of Danny Schoening’s Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) grant from January 2019 were revised as described\nbelow. The Company amortizes the grant date fair value of $264 thousand to stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis across the three-year vesting period beginning\non January 2, 2019. As of June 30, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation cost relating to this award.\nOn February 17, 2020, the Company granted 50,000 restricted stock units to Bill Bates, General Manager of the Applied Optics Center. The restricted stock units vest as of\nJanuary 1 each year subsequent to the grant date over a three-year period at a rate of 34% in year one, and 33% each year thereafter. The stock price at grant date was $2.13 per\nshare. The Company amortized the grant date fair value of $107 thousand to stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis across the three-year vesting period beginning\non February 17, 2020.\nOn April 30, 2020, the Board of Directors held a meeting and voted to increase the annual board compensation for the three independent directors from $22,000 to $36,000 with\nan effective date of January 1, 2020, in addition to granting 100,000 shares of restricted stock to each independent director which vest at a rate of 20% per year (20,000 shares)\neach January 1st through January 1, 2025. The total fair value for the 300,000 shares was $525 thousand based on the stock price of $1.75 as of April 30, 2020. On each of\nJanuary 1, 2021, January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2023, 60,000 of the restricted director shares vested. On February 16, 2023, 40,000 of the unvested restricted shares were\nforfeited and cancelled when one of the independent directors departed the Board.\nThe Company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Danny Schoening dated December 1, 2021.The updated employment agreement also served to\namend Mr. Schoening’s RSU Agreement, dated January 2, 2019, by changing the third and final vesting date for the restricted stock units granted under such agreement from\nJanuary 1, 2022 to the “change of control date,” that being the first of the following to occur with respect to the Company: (i) any “Person,” as that term is defined in Sections\n13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), with certain exclusions, is or becomes the “Beneficial Owner” (as that term is\ndefined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of\nthe Company’s then outstanding securities; or (ii) the Company is merged or consolidated with any other corporation or other entity, other than: (A) a merger or consolidation\nwhich would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being\nconverted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving\nentity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or (B) the Company engages in a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the\nCompany (or similar transaction) in which no “Person” (as defined above) acquires fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then\noutstanding securities. The amended RSU Agreement contains certain exceptions to the definition of change of control.\nF-16\nAs of the December 1, 2021 modification date related to the third and final vesting date of the 49,500 unvested restricted stock units held by Danny Schoening, there was no\nchange in the fair value of the modified award as compared to the original award immediately prior to the modification date. The restricted stock units initially were certain to\nvest on January 1, 2022, but due to the modification, they were less certain to vest, contingent on a “change in control” occurring, which change in control, in case Mr.\nSchoening was terminated by the Company without cause or he resigns with good reason prior to such change in control, was required to occur prior to March 13, 2023. As of\nthe modification date, there was $5 thousand of unrecognized compensation cost associated with the original award. As a matter of expediency, the unrecognized compensation\nexpense as of the modification date was fully expensed through January 1, 2022. There is no additional compensation expense associated with the modification of the restricted\nstock unit agreement.\nOn November 28, 2022, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Danny Schoening which amended Mr. Schoening’s RSU Agreement, dated January 2,\n2019, which had been previously amended as of December 1, 2021, by changing the third and final vesting date for the restricted stock units granted under such agreement\nfrom the “change of control date” to January 1, 2023.\nOn January 4, 2023, the Company issued 46,432 common shares to Danny Schoening, CEO, and Bill Bates (AOC GM), net of tax withholding of $58 thousand, in settlement\nof 66,000 restricted stock units which vested on January 1, 2023.\nOn May 1, 2023, the Company granted an aggregate of 39,000 restricted stock units to eleven employees under its 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. As of the grant date, assuming a\n23.1% forfeiture rate based on expected turnover across the three years, the aggregate value of the restricted stock units is $90 thousand which will be amortized across the\nthree-year period on a straight-line basis. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, there were 3,000 restricted stock units forfeited. On August 14, 2023 there was an\nadditional grant of 3,000 restricted stock units to one new employee with a fair value of $11 thousand. The restricted stock units will vest at a rate of 33.33% annually on the\nanniversary date of the grant and any unvested restricted stock units will be forfeited if employment terminates prior to the relevant vesting date.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, there were 66,500 and 39,000 unvested restricted stock units outstanding, respectively.\nOn May 3, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 100,000 and 35,000 performance shares to Danny Schoening, CEO, and Karen Hawkins, CFO, respectively. Each\nperformance share represents a contingent right to receive one share of common stock. The performance shares vest in five equal increments if, in each case and during a five-\nyear performance period beginning on October 2, 2023, the average VWAP per share of common stock over a 30 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds $3.70, $4.45,\n$5.35, $6.40, or $7.70. The fair value of the shares, as of the grant date, is $320 thousand and will be amortized through December 31, 2025 based on the derived service\nperiods using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model.\nOn May 9, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 40,000 shares of restricted stock to independent board member Dayton Judd. The shares vest 50% on each of\nJanuary 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025. As of the grant date, the fair value of the shares was $124 thousand, to be amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2024.\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were 60,000 unvested restricted shares outstanding.\nOn October 2, 2023, 27,000 performance shares vested for reaching the 30-day VWAP for Tranche 1.

The Company issued a total of 20,669 shares on March 13, 2024\nin settlement of the vested shares, net of tax withheld of $46 thousand.\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company granted an aggregate of 39,000 restricted stock units to eleven employees under its 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. As of the grant date, assuming a\n7.7% forfeiture rate based on expected turnover across the three years, the aggregate value of the restricted stock units is $258 thousand which will be amortized across the\nthree-year period on a straight-line basis. The restricted stock units will vest at a rate of 33.33% annually on the anniversary date of the grant and any unvested restricted stock\nunits will be forfeited if employment terminates prior to the relevant vesting date. On June 4, 2024 there was an additional grant of 500 restricted stock units to one employee\nwith a fair value of $4 thousand. The 500 restricted stock units will vest 100% on the anniversary date of the grant and will be forfeited if employment terminates prior to the\nrelevant vesting date.\nOn May 1, 2024, there were 12,000 shares vested under its 2023 Equity Incentive Plan for restricted stock units granted on May 1, 2023.

(collectively, the “Company”), entered into an asset purchase\nagreement and a contract manufacturing agreement with RUB Aluminum s.r.o. (“RUB”). Under the agreements, the Company acquired certain intellectual property and\ntechnical and marketing information relating to the Speedtracker Mach product line, which is primarily used for firearm projectile speed detection, measuring and tracking.\nRUB may continue to manufacture Speedtracker Mach products on behalf of the Company. The Company acquired the assets using $1 million in cash on hand, with potential\nadditional future cash payments based on successful completion of defined milestones. The initial term of the contract manufacturing agreement is one year, subject to\nadditional one-year renewal terms to which both parties must agree. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company has determined it would be more economical to move the\nmanufacturing operations in house and is no longer ordering assembled units against the contract manufacturing agreement.\nThe acquisition included transaction costs of $30 thousand for legal fees. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, the total earnout payment would have been $238 thousand\nonly if the earnout revenue milestones were achieved during the earnout period, otherwise the earnout would be zero. As of January 18, 2024, the fair value of the contingent\nliability was $83 thousand. As of June 30, 2024, it was determined that the revenue milestones related to the earnout agreement would be unachievable within the earnout\nperiod and the fair value of the contingent liability related to the earnout was set to zero.\nThe intangible asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over seven years and reviewed annually at each fiscal year end for possible impairment.\nAs of June 30, 2024 the value of intangible assets is:\nJune 30, 2024\nIntangible Assets – Intellectual Property $ 1,030\nAmortization of Intangible Assets (61)\nNet Intangible Assets $ 969\nF-19\nNote 8 - Stockholders’ Equity\nDividends\nNo dividends were declared or paid during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 or the twelve months ended October 1, 2023.\nCommon Stock\nOn September 22, 2021, the Company announced authorization of a $1 million stock repurchase program. The shares authorized to be repurchased under the repurchase\nprogram may be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market transactions or in negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and\nsubject to Rule 10b-18 as promulgated by the SEC.\nDuring the three and nine months ended July 2, 2023 and June 30, 2024, there were zero common shares repurchased under the program.\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued 20,426 and 101,718 shares to Danny Schoening and Karen Hawkins in settlement of 27,000 and\n135,000 performance shares, which vested during the three and nine months, respectively. The shares were issued net of 6,574 and 33,282 shares withheld for taxes.\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued 8,446 shares to ten employees in settlement of 12,000 restricted stock units, which vested during\nthe three and nine months. The shares were issued net of 3,554 shares withheld for taxes.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, total outstanding common shares were 6,873,234 and 6,763,070, respectively.\nNote 9 - Subsequent Events\nThere are none.\nF-20\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to supplement and complement our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2024, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). You are encouraged to review our consolidated financial\nstatements in conjunction with your review of this MD&A. The financial information in this MD&A has been prepared in accordance with GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. In\naddition, we use non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental indicators of our operating performance and financial position. We use these non-GAAP financial measures\ninternally for comparing actual results from one period to another, as well as for planning purposes. We will also report non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental\ninformation, as we believe their use provides more insight into our performance. When a non-GAAP measure is used in this MD&A, it is clearly identified as a non-GAAP\nmeasure and reconciled to the most closely corresponding GAAP measure.\nThe following discussion highlights the principal factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations as well as our liquidity and capital resources for\nthe periods described. The operating results for the periods presented were not significantly affected by inflation.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in particular the MD&A, contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Any statements contained in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other\nreports, statements, and information we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”), in our press releases, presentations to securities\nanalysts or investors, or in oral statements made by or with the approval of an executive officer, the words or phrases “believes,” “may,” “will,” “expects,” “should,”\n“continue,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “will likely result,” “estimates,” “projects” or similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify such forward-looking\nstatements.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies concerning future events, including, but not limited to, any statements regarding\ngrowth strategy; product and development programs; financial performance and financial condition (including revenue, net income, profit margins and working capital); orders\nand backlog; expected timing of contract deliveries to customers and corresponding revenue recognition; increases in the cost of materials and labor; costs remaining to fulfill\ncontracts; contract loss reserves; labor shortages; follow-on orders; supply chain challenges; the continuation of historical trends; the sufficiency of our cash balances for future\nliquidity and capital resource needs; the expected impact of changes in accounting policies on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows; anticipated problems\nand our plans for future operations; and the economy in general or the future of the defense industry.\nWe caution that these statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control, and actual results may differ materially depending on a\nvariety of important factors. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, continued funding of defense programs and military spending, the timing of such\nfunding, general economic and business conditions, including unforeseen weakness in the Company’s markets, effects of continued geopolitical unrest and regional conflicts,\ncompetition, changes in technology and methods of marketing, delays in completing engineering and manufacturing programs, changes in customer order patterns, changes in\nproduct mix, continued success in technological advances and delivering technological innovations, changes in the U.S. Government’s interpretation of federal procurement\nrules and regulations, changes in spending due to policy changes in any new federal presidential administration, market acceptance of the Company’s products, shortages in\ncomponents, production delays due to performance quality issues with outsourced components, inability to fully realize the expected benefits from acquisitions and\nrestructurings or delays in realizing such benefits, challenges in integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated synergies, changes to export regulations, increases in\ntax rates, changes to generally accepted accounting principles, difficulties in retaining key employees and customers, unanticipated costs under fixed-price service and system\nintegration engagements, changes in the market for microcap stocks regardless of growth and value and various other factors beyond our control. Some of these risks and\nuncertainties are identified in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the section “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K and you are urged to review those sections. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not\nconsider any such list to be a complete list of all potential risks or uncertainties.\n1\nWe do not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. You should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors described in this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBackground\nOptex Systems Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our) manufactures optical sighting systems and assemblies, primarily for\nDepartment of Defense applications. Its products are installed on various types of U.S. military land vehicles, such as the Abrams and Bradley fighting vehicles, light armored\nand armored security vehicles and have been selected for installation on the Stryker family of vehicles. We also manufacture and deliver numerous periscope configurations,\nrifle and surveillance sights and night vision optical assemblies. Our products consist primarily of build-to-customer print products that are delivered both directly to the armed\nservices and to other defense prime contractors. Less than 1% of today’s revenue is related to the resale of products substantially manufactured by others. In this case, the\nproduct would likely be a simple replacement part of a larger system previously produced by us.\nWe are both a prime and sub-prime contractor to the Department of Defense. Sub-prime contracts are typically issued through major defense contractors such as General\nDynamics Land Systems, Raytheon Corp., BAE Systems plc, ADS Inc. and others. We are also a military supplier to foreign governments such as Israel, Australia and South\nAmerican countries and as a subcontractor for several large U.S. defense companies serving foreign governments.\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation is the principal set of regulations that govern the acquisition process of government agencies and contracts with the U.S. government. In\ngeneral, parts of the Federal Acquisition Regulation are incorporated into government solicitations and contracts by reference as terms and conditions effecting contract awards\nand pricing solicitations.\nMany of our contracts are prime or subcontracted directly with the Federal government and, as such, are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 49.5, “Contract\nTermination Clauses” and more specifically Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses 52.249-2 “Termination for Convenience of the Government (Fixed-Price)”, and 49.504\n“Termination of fixed-price contracts for default”. These clauses are standard clauses on our prime military contracts and generally apply to us as subcontractors. It has been\nour experience that the termination for convenience is rarely invoked, except where it is mutually beneficial for both parties. We are currently not aware of any pending\nterminations for convenience or for default on our existing contracts.\nIn the event a termination for convenience were to occur, Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.249-2 provides for full recovery of all contractual costs and profits\nreasonably occurred up to and as a result of the terminated contract. In the event a termination for default were to occur, we could be liable for any excess cost incurred by the\ngovernment to acquire supplies from another supplier similar to those terminated from us. We would not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract\narises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Company as defined by Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.249-8.\nIn addition, some of our contracts allow for government contract financing in the form of contract progress payments pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.232-16,\n“Progress Payments”. As a small business, and subject to certain limitations, this clause provides for government payment of up to 90% of incurred program costs prior to\nproduct delivery. To the extent our contracts allow for progress payments, we intend to utilize this benefit, thereby minimizing the working capital impact on us for materials\nand labor required to complete the contracts.\n2\nRecent Events\nJanuary 2024 Asset Acquisition\nOn January 18, 2024, we entered into an asset purchase agreement and a contract manufacturing agreement with RUB Aluminium s.r.o. (“RUB”). Under the agreements, the\nCompany acquired certain intellectual property and technical and marketing information relating to the Speedtracker Mach product line, which is primarily used for firearm\nprojectile speed detection, measuring and tracking. RUB will continue to manufacture Speedtracker Mach products on behalf of the Company. The Company acquired the\nassets using $1 million in cash on hand, with potential additional future cash payments based on successful completion of defined milestones. The initial term of the contract\nmanufacturing agreement is one year, subject to additional one-year renewal terms to which both parties must agree. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company has\ndetermined it would be more economical to move the manufacturing operations in house and is no longer ordering assembled units against the contract manufacturing\nagreement.\nThe acquisition included transaction costs of $30 thousand for legal fees and a contingent liability for payment against an earnout agreement based on meeting certain revenue\nmilestones. As of June 30, 2024, the fair value of the contingent liability was zero. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, the total earnout payment will be $238 thousand\nonly if the earnout revenue milestone is achieved during the earnout period, otherwise the earnout will be zero. As of June 30, 2024 the Company determined the likelihood of\nachieving the revenue milestone during the earnout period was highly unlikely. The asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a seven-year period.\nMaterial Trends\nRecent supply chain disruptions have strained our suppliers and extended supplier delivery lead times, affecting our ability to sustain operations. We anticipate market wide\nmaterial shortages for paint and resin products as well as critical epoxies and chemicals used in our manufacturing process. In addition, we have seen substantial increases in\nthe costs of aluminum, steel and acrylic commodities, which has affected our net income in the year ended October 1, 2023 and the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024,\nand is expected to continue to have a negative effect on the margins expected to be generated under our long-term fixed contracts over the next two years. See also “Item 1A.\nRisk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business - Certain of our products are dependent on specialized sources of supply potentially subject to disruption which could have a\nmaterial, adverse impact on our business” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2023.\nWe have also experienced significant material shortages during the year ended October 1, 2023 and extending into the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 from several\nsignificant suppliers of our periscope covers and housings. These shortages affect several of our periscope products at the Optex Richardson segment. The delays in key\ncomponents, combined with labor shortages during the year ended October 1, 2023 and continuing into the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, have negatively impacted our\nproduction levels and continue to push back expected delivery dates. We are actively seeking alternative sources as well as expediting our current suppliers for these\ncomponents. We are also increasing employee recruitment initiatives and overtime to attempt to mitigate any continuing risks to the periscope line.\nWe are seeing some recent improvements in the local labor market and are adding to our direct labor force in concert with improvements in our supplier delivery performance.\nWhile we are encouraged by improvements in supplier performance for the Optex Richardson segment periscope line which yielded increased revenue performance during\nfiscal year 2023 and into the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we have yet to ramp up deliveries sufficiently to keep pace with our current customer demands. As such, we\ncannot give any assurances that expected customer delivery dates for our periscope products will not experience further delays.\nIn March 2023, we moved our line of credit from PNC Bank to Texas Capital Bank and increased our available line of credit to $3.0 million from the previous $2.0 million line\nwith PNC. The increase in credit limit helps us meet our working capital requirements in light of the increased backlog and delay of revenues from the fiscal year 2023.\nWe refer also to “Item 1. Business – Market Opportunity: U.S. Military” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2023 for a description of current\ntrends in U.S. government military spending and its potential impact on Optex, which may be material, including particularly the tables included in that section and disclosure\non the significant reduction in spending for U.S. ground system military programs, which has a direct impact on the Optex Richardson segment revenue, all of which is\nincorporated herein by reference.\n3\nResults of Operations\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\nWe use adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) as an additional measure for evaluating the performance of our business as “net\nincome” includes the significant impact of noncash compensation expenses related to equity stock grants, as well as depreciation, amortization, interest expenses and federal\nincome taxes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance because it permits period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core\noperations before the excluded items, which we do not consider relevant to our operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not required by, or presented in accordance\nwith, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. This non-GAAP measure\nexcludes certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not\ncalculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative measure.\nThe table below summarizes our three-and nine-month operating results for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023, in terms of both the GAAP net income measure\nand the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA measure. We believe that including both measures allows the reader better to evaluate our overall performance.\n(Thousands)\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nJune 30, 2024 July 2, 2023 June 30, 2024 July 2, 2023\nNet Income (GAAP) $ 1,261 $ 576 $ 2,754 $ 832\nAdd:\nFederal Income Tax Expense 337 154 737 223\nDepreciation 132 86 341 252\nStock Compensation 90 81 360 134\nInterest Expense 17 22 32 31\nAdjusted EBITDA - Non GAAP $ 1,837 $ 919 $ 4,224 $ 1,472\nOur net income increased by $0.7 million to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to net income of $0.6 million for the prior year period. Our\nadjusted EBITDA increased by $0.9 million to $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $0.9 million for the prior year period.\nOur net income increased by $1.9 million to $2.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to a net income of $0.8 million for the prior year period. Our\nadjusted EBITDA increased by $2.7 million to $4.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $1.5 million for the prior year period.\nThe increase in the most recent three and nine-month period net income and adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by increased revenue and gross profit, which was only\npartially offset by increased general and administrative expenses.

For the nine months ended June 30, 2024,\nour total revenues increased by $7.0 million, or 39.6%, compared to the prior year period. The increase in revenue for the three and nine-month periods was driven by increased\ncustomer demand for military products across both operating segments partially offset by lower customer demand in commercial optical assemblies.\nConsolidated gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $1.2 million, or 68.3%, compared to the prior year period. Consolidated gross profit for the\nnine months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $3.1 million, or 78.8%, compared to the prior year period. The increase in the most recent three and nine-month period’s gross\nmargin was primarily attributable to higher revenue spread across a fixed manufacturing cost base combined with changes in product mix and improved pricing and operating\nperformance in both operating segments.\nOur operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $0.9 million, or 114.8%, compared to the prior year period. Our operating income for the nine\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 increased by $2.4 million, or 224.4%, compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating income for the three and nine-month periods\nwas primarily driven by higher revenue and increased gross margin in both operating segments.\n6\nNew Orders and Backlog\nProduct backlog represents the value of unfulfilled customer manufacturing orders yet to be recognized as revenue. While backlog is not a non-GAAP financial measure, it is\nalso not defined by GAAP. Therefore, our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies. The booked backlog by\nperiod may also not be fully indicative of the predicted revenues for those periods as many of our orders provide for accelerated delivery without penalty and may additionally\nprovide customers the option to adjust schedules to meet their most recent projected demand quantities. However, we provide customer order and backlog information as we\nbelieve it provides significant insight into forward demand, with some predictive power to short term future revenues.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company booked $28.3 million in new orders, representing a 7.6% increase over the prior year period. The orders for the\nmost recently completed nine months consist of $18.5 million for our Optex Richardson segment and $9.8 million attributable to the Applied Optics Center segment.\nThe following table depicts the new customer orders for the nine months ending June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period in millions of dollars:\n(Millions)\nNine months ended Nine months ended\nProduct Line June 30, 2024 July 2, 2023 Variance % Chg\nPeriscopes $ 15.9 $ 11.6 $ 4.3 37.1%\nSighting Systems 0.3 4.0 (3.7) (92.5)%\nHowitzer - - - -%\nOther 2.3 3.0 (0.7) (23.3)%\nOptex Systems – Richardson 18.5 18.6 (0.1) (0.5)%\nOptical Assemblies 1.8 1.2 0.6 50.0%\nLaser Filters 6.5 5.5 1.0 18.2%\nDay Windows 0.1 0.1 - -%\nOther 1.4 0.9 0.5 55.6%\nApplied Optics Center – Dallas 9.8 7.7 2.1 27.3%\nTotal Customer Orders $ 28.3 $ 26.3 $ 2.0 7.6%\nDuring the current year nine-month period ended June 30, 2024, orders in the Company’s Optex Richardson segment decreased by ($0.1) million, or (0.5%) as compared to the\nprior year period. The primary reason for the decrease relates to a prior year award for $3.4 million in sighting systems to repair and refurbish night vision equipment for the\nGovernment of Israel. We began shipments against the contract in December 2023. The decrease in orders for sighting systems and other products was offset by a significant\nincrease in periscope orders in the current year nine-month period. The Applied Optics Center orders increased $2.1 million, or 27.3% as we continue to see increases in orders\nfor laser filter units for several prime government contractors, in addition to an increase in customer orders for commercial optical assemblies and other products driven by our\nnew program of Infrared (IR) Signature Reduction Coatings used on aircraft.\n7\nBacklog as of June 30, 2024 was $45.6 million. This compares to a backlog of $41.8 million as of October 1, 2023, representing an increase of $3.8 million, or 9.1%, and a\nbacklog of $41.6 million as of July 2, 2023, representing an increase of $4.0 million, or 9.6%.

Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on July 8, 2024, the Company announced a $2.5 million order for laser filter units to be delivered from August 2024 through July\n2025.\nPlease refer to “Material Trends” above and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for more information on recent developments and trends with respect to our orders and\nbacklog, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe Company continues to pursue domestic, international and commercial opportunities in addition to maintaining its current footprint with U.S. vehicle manufactures, with\nexisting as well as new product lines. We are also reviewing potential products outside our traditional product lines, which could be manufactured using our current production\nfacilities in order to capitalize on our existing excess capacity.\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended July 2, 2023\nRevenue. For the three months ended June 30 2024, revenue increased by $1.9 million or 26.3% compared to the prior year period as set forth in the table below:\nThree months ended\n(Thousands)\nProduct Line June 30, 2024 July 2, 2023 Variance % Chg\nPeriscopes $ 3,171 $ 2,623 $ 548 20.9%\nSighting Systems 432 137 295 215.3%\nHowitzers - - - -\nOther 1,072 309 763 246.9%\nOptex Richardson 4,675 3,069 1,606 52.3%\nOptical Assemblies 963 1,452 (489) (33.7)%\nLaser Filters 2,941 2,286 655 28.7%\nDay Windows 109 120 (11) (9.2)%\nOther 372 245 127 51.8%\nApplied Optics Center - Dallas 4,385 4,103 282 6.9%\nTotal Revenue $ 9,060 $ 7,172 $ 1,888 26.3%\n8\nOptex Richardson revenue increased by $1.6 million or 52.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period on higher customer demand for\nperiscopes, sighting systems and other products including collimators, cell assemblies, and spare parts.\nApplied Optics Center revenue increased by $0.3 million or 6.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. The revenue increase is\nprimarily attributable to increased customer demand for laser filters and other products driven by our new program of Infrared (IR) Signature Reduction Coatings used on\naircraft partially offset by lower customer demand for commercial optical assemblies.\nGross Margin. The gross margin during the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 was 31.8% of revenue as compared to a gross margin of 23.9% of revenue for the prior\nyear period. The increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to higher revenue, changes in product mix, and increased absorption of fixed overhead across a higher revenue\nmix. Cost of sales increased to $6.2 million for the current period as compared to the prior year period of $5.5 million on higher revenue.\nG&A Expenses. During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023, we recorded operating expenses of $1.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Operating\nexpenses increased by 31.9% between the respective periods primarily due to increased spending on royalties, selling expenses, investor relations, IT support services and legal\nexpenses.\nOperating Income. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded operating income of $1.6 million, as compared to operating income of $0.8 million during the\nthree months ended July 2, 2023. The $0.8 million increase in operating income for the current year period from the prior year period is primarily due to increased revenue and\ngross margin, partially offset by higher general and administrative spending.\nNine months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine months Ended July 2, 2023\nRevenue. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024, revenues increased by $7.0 million or 39.6% compared to the prior year period as set forth in the table below:\nNine months ended\n(Thousands)\nProduct Line June 30, 2024 July 2, 2023 Variance % Chg\nPeriscopes $ 7,842 $ 6,085 $ 1,757 28.9%\nSighting Systems 1,003 464 539 116.2%\nHowitzers - - - -\nOther 3,499 1,193 2,306 193.3%\nOptex Systems - Richardson 12,344 7,742 4,602 59.4%\nOptical Assemblies 3,252 4,438 (1,186) (26.7)%\nLaser Filters 7,208 4,404 2,804 63.7%\nDay Windows 460 350 110 31.4%\nOther 1,288 648 640 98.8%\nApplied Optics Center - Dallas 12,208 9,840 2,368 24.1%\nTotal Revenue $ 24,552 $ 17,582 $ 6,970 39.6%\nOptex Richardson revenue increased by $4.6 million or 59.4% for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period on higher customer demand for\nperiscopes, sighting systems and other products including collimators, cell assemblies, and spare parts.\nApplied Optics Center revenue increased by $2.4 million or 24.1% for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. The revenue increase is\nprimarily attributable to increased customer demand for laser filters and other products driven by our new program of Infrared (IR) Signature Reduction Coatings used on\naircraft partially offset by lower customer demand for commercial optical assemblies.\n9\nGross Margin. The gross margin during the nine-month period ended June 30, 2024 was 29.0% as compared to a gross margin of 22.7% for the prior year period. The increase\nin gross profit is primarily attributable to higher revenue, changes in product mix, and increased absorption of fixed overhead across a higher revenue mix. Cost of sales\nincreased to $17.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period of $13.6 million on higher revenue.\nG&A Expenses. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023, we recorded operating expenses of $3.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Operating\nexpenses increased by 24.2% between the respective periods primarily due to increased spending on labor, stock compensation, royalties, selling expenses, investor relations\nand IT support services.\nOperating Income. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded operating income of $3.5 million, as compared to an operating income of $1.1 million during the\nnine months ended July 2, 2023. The $2.4 million increase in operating income is primarily due to increased revenue and gross margin, partially offset by higher general and\nadministrative spending.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of $14.2 million, as compared to $13.5 million as of October 1, 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, we generated operating cash of $1.0 million, and spent $1.5 million on acquisitions of equipment and intangible assets. During\nthe period, our inventory increased $3.0 million in support of new program awards, higher backlog and increasing revenues anticipated over the next twelve months.\nThe Company has capital commitments of $0.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment consisting of a significant coating chamber upgrade, an Opotek tunable laser\nsystem and a laser engraving machine.\nBacklog as of June 30, 2024 was $45.6 million as compared to backlog of $41.6 million as of July 2, 2023 and $41.8 million as of October 1, 2023, representing an increase of\n9.6% and 9.1%, respectively. For further details, see “Results of Operations – New Orders and Backlog” above.\nThe Company has historically funded its operations through cash from operations, convertible notes, common and preferred stock offerings and bank debt. The Company’s\nability to generate positive cash flows depends on a variety of factors, including the continued development and successful marketing of the Company’s products.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Company had $0.5 million in cash and an outstanding payable balance of $1.0 million against its line of credit. At June 30, 2024, our outstanding\naccounts receivable balance was $3.3 million. We expect the accounts to be collected during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nWe refer to the disclosure under “Material Trends” with respect to recent supply chain disruptions and material shortages, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn the short term, the Company plans to utilize its current cash, available line of credit and operating cash flow to fund inventory purchases in support of the backlog growth\nand higher anticipated revenue during the next twelve months. Short term cash in excess of our working capital needs may be also be used to fund the purchase of product lines\nand other assets, including property and equipment required to maintain or meet our growing backlog, in addition to repurchasing common stock against our current stock\nrepurchase plan. Longer term, excess cash beyond our operating needs may be used to fund new product development, company or product line acquisitions, or additional stock\npurchases as attractive opportunities present themselves.\nOn January 18, 2024, the Company acquired certain intellectual property and technical and marketing information relating to the Speedtracker Mach product line and entered\ninto an asset purchase agreement and a contract manufacturing agreement with RUB Aluminium s.r.o. (“RUB”). The Company acquired the assets using $1 million in cash on\nhand, with potential additional future cash payments based on successful completion of defined milestones. The initial term of the contract manufacturing agreement is one\nyear, subject to additional one-year renewal terms.\n10\nThe acquisition included transaction costs of $30 thousand for legal fees. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, the total earnout payment will be $238 thousand only if the\nearnout revenue milestone is achieved during the earnout period, otherwise the earnout will be zero. As of June 30, 2024, it was determined that the earnout revenue milestone\nwas unlikely to be achieved during the earnout period and the fair value of the contingent liability was zero. The asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a seven-\nyear period.\nIn some instances, new government contract awards may allow for contract financing in the form of progress payments pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.232-16,\n“Progress Payments.” Subject to certain limitations, this clause provides for government payment of up to 90% of incurred program costs prior to product delivery for small\nbusinesses like us. To the extent any contracts allow for progress payments and the respective contracts would result in significant preproduction cash requirements for design,\nprocess development, tooling, material or other resources which could exceed our current working capital or line of credit availability, we intend to utilize this benefit to\nminimize any potential negative impact on working capital prior to receipt of payment for the associated contract deliveries. Currently none of our existing contracts allow for\nprogress payments.\nWe refer to “Note 4 – Commitments and Contingencies – Non-cancellable Operating Leases” for a tabular depiction of our remaining minimum lease and estimated CAM\npayments under such leases as of June 30, 2024, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe Company expects to generate net income and positive cash flow from operating activities over the next twelve months. To achieve and retain profitability, we need to\nmaintain a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. Management intends to manage operations commensurate with its level of working capital and line of credit\nduring the next twelve months and beyond; however, uneven revenue levels driven by changes in customer delivery demands, first article inspection requirements or other\nprogram delays associated with the pandemic, labor shortages and supply chain issues could create a working capital shortfall. In the event the Company does not successfully\nimplement its ultimate business plan, certain assets may not be recoverable.\nOn March 22, 2023, we entered into a Business Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Texas Capital Bank (the “Lender”), pursuant to which the Lender will make\navailable to the Borrowers a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of $3 million (the “Credit Facility”). The commitment period for advances under the Credit Facility\nis twenty-six months expiring on May 22, 2025. We refer to the expiration of that time period as the “Maturity Date.” Outstanding advances under the Credit Facility will\naccrue interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus a specified margin, subject to a specified floor interest rate. The interest rate is currently at\n8.07% per annum.\nThe Loan Agreement contains customary events of default (including a 25% change in ownership) and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing\nindebtedness, liens, fundamental changes (including changes in management), investments, and restricted payments (including cash dividends). The Loan Agreement also\nrequires the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 and a total leverage ratio of 3.00:1. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the\noperating assets of the Borrowers as collateral. The Borrowers’ obligations under the Credit Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default as\ndefined in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement further provides for a $125,000 Letter of Credit sublimit. As of June 30, 2024, there was $1.0 million borrowed under the\nCredit Facility. As of June 30, 2024, the Company is in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility replaced the prior $2 million line of credit with PNC Bank, National Association.\nOn September 22, 2021 the Company announced authorization for an additional $1 million stock repurchase program. As of June 30, 2024, there was an authorized balance of\n$560 thousand remaining to be spent against the repurchase program. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, there were no stock repurchases against the plan.\n11\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nA critical accounting estimate is an estimate that:\n● is made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\n● involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty, and\n● has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operation.\nOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies require that we use estimates\nand assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. These policies are described in “Critical Policies and Accounting Pronouncements”\nand Note 2 (Accounting Policies) to consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2023.\nOur critical accounting estimates include warranty costs, contract losses and the deferred tax asset valuation. Future warranty costs are based on the estimated cost of\nreplacement for expected returns based upon our most recent experience rate of defects as a percentage of warranty covered sales. Our warranty covered sales primarily include\nthe Applied Optics Center optical assemblies. While our warranty period is 12 months, our reserve balances assume a general 90-day return period for optical assemblies\npreviously delivered plus any returned backlog in-house that has not yet been repaired or replaced to our customer. If our actual warranty returns should significantly exceed\nour historical rates on new customer products, significant production changes, or substantial customer changes to the 90-day turn-around times on returned goods, the impact\ncould be material to our operating profit. We have not experienced any significant changes to our warranty trends in the preceding three years and do not anticipate any\nsignificant impacts in the near term. We monitor the actual warranty costs incurred to the expected values on a quarterly basis and adjust our estimates accordingly. As of June\n30, 2024, the Company had accrued warranty costs of $36 thousand, as compared to $75 thousand as of October 1, 2023. The primary reason for the $39 thousand decrease in\nreserve balances relates to lower sales of commercial optical assemblies in combination with improved warranty return trends during the nine-month period.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, we had $101 thousand, and $243 thousand, respectively, of contract loss reserves included in our balance sheet accrued expenses.\nThese loss contracts are related to some of our older legacy periscope IDIQ contracts which were priced in 2018 through early 2020, prior to COVID-19 and the significant\ndownturn in defense spending on ground system vehicles. Due to inflationary price increases on component parts and higher internal manufacturing costs (as a result of\nescalating labor costs and higher burden rates on reduced volume), some of these contracts are in a loss condition, or at marginal profit rates. These contracts are typically three-\nyear IDIQ contracts with two optional award years, and as such, we are obligated to accept new task awards against these contracts until the contract expiration. One of these\nlong-term contracts has an option year ordering period ending in February 2025 with deliveries that may extend into February 2026. Should contract costs continue to increase\nabove the negotiated selling price, or in the event the customer should release substantial quantities against these existing loss contracts, the losses could be material. For\ncontracts currently in a loss status based on the estimated per unit contract costs, losses are booked immediately on new task order awards. During the three and nine months\nended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain on changes in estimates for the contract loss reserves of $16 thousand and $45 thousand and applied reserves of $34\nthousand $97 thousand to cost of sales against revenues booked during the periods, respectively. There is no way to reasonably estimate future inflationary impacts, or customer\nawards on the existing loss contracts.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the Company had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of ($0.8) million against deferred tax assets of $1.6 million and $1.7\nmillion, respectively, for a net deferred tax asset of $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our deferred tax assets decreased\nby $0.1 million related to temporary tax adjustments. The valuation allowance has been established due to historical losses resulting in a Net Operating Loss Carryforward for\neach of the fiscal years 2011 through 2016 which may not be fully recognized due to an IRS Section 382 limitation related to a change in control.\n12\nItem 3.

(“Optex Systems Holdings,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), in particular Part II Item 7\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A\nof the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Any statements\ncontained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. When used in this Annual Report on\nForm 10- K and other reports, statements, and information we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”), in our press releases,\npresentations to securities analysts or investors, or in oral statements made by or with the approval of an executive officer, the words or phrases “believes,” “may,” “will,”\n“expects,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “will likely result,” “estimates,” “projects” or similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify such\nforward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies concerning future events, including, but not limited to, any statements regarding\nour growth strategy; product and development programs; financial performance and financial condition (including revenue, net income, profit margins and working capital);\norders and backlog; expected timing of contract deliveries to customers and corresponding revenue recognition; increases in the cost of materials and labor; costs remaining to\nfulfill contracts; contract loss reserves; labor shortages; follow-on orders; supply chain challenges; the continuation of historical trends; the sufficiency of our cash balances for\nfuture liquidity and capital resource needs; the expected impact of changes in accounting policies on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows; anticipated\nproblems and our plans for future operations; and the economy in general or the future of the defense industry.\nWe caution that these statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control, and actual results may differ materially depending on a\nvariety of important factors. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, continued funding of defense programs and military spending, the timing of such\nfunding, general economic and business conditions, including unforeseen weakness in the Company’s markets, effects of continued geopolitical unrest and regional conflicts,\ncompetition, changes in technology and methods of marketing, delays in completing engineering and manufacturing programs, changes in customer order patterns, changes in\nproduct mix, continued success in technological advances and delivering technological innovations, changes in the U.S. Government’s interpretation of federal procurement\nrules and regulations, changes in spending due to policy changes in any new federal presidential administration, market acceptance of the Company’s products, shortages in\ncomponents, production delays due to performance quality issues with outsourced components, inability to fully realize the expected benefits from acquisitions and\nrestructurings or delays in realizing such benefits, challenges in integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated synergies, changes to export regulations, increases in\ntax rates, changes to generally accepted accounting principles, difficulties in retaining key employees and customers, unanticipated costs under fixed-price service and system\nintegration engagements, changes in the market for microcap stocks regardless of growth and value and various other factors beyond our control. Some of these risks and\nuncertainties are identified in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the section “Item 1A Risk Factors” in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K and you are urged to review that section. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you\nshould not consider any such list to be a complete list of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nWe do not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. You should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors described in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n3\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nCurrent Lines of Business\nWe manufacture optical sighting systems and assemblies for the U.S. Department of Defense, foreign military applications and commercial markets. Our products are installed\non a variety of U.S. military land vehicles, such as the Abrams and Bradley fighting vehicles, light armored and advanced security vehicles and the Stryker family of vehicles.\nWe also manufacture and deliver numerous periscope configurations, rifle and surveillance sights and night vision optical assemblies. Our products consist primarily of build-\nto-customer print products that are delivered both directly to the armed services and to other defense prime contractors. Less than 1% of our revenue is related to the resale of\nproducts substantially manufactured by others. In this case, the product would likely be a simple replacement part of a larger system previously produced by us.\nWe continue to field new product opportunities from both domestic and international customers. We believe that given continuing unrest in multiple global hot spots, the need\nfor precision optics continues to increase. Most of these requirements are for observation and situational awareness applications; however, we continue to see requests for\nhigher magnification and custom reticles in various product modifications. The basic need to protect the soldier while providing information about the mission environment\ncontinues to be the primary driver for these requirements.\nRecent Events\nMay 2023 Grants\nOn May 9, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 40,000 shares of restricted stock to independent board member Dayton Judd. The shares vest 50% on each of\nJanuary 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025. As of the grant date, the fair value of the shares was $124 thousand, to be amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2024.\nOn May 3, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 100,000 and 35,000 performance shares to Danny Schoening, CEO, and Karen Hawkins, CFO, respectively. Each\nperformance share represents a contingent right to receive one share of common stock. The performance shares vest in five equal increments if, in each case and during a five-\nyear performance period beginning on October 2, 2023, the average VWAP per share of common stock over a 30 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds $3.70, $4.45,\n$5.35, $6.40, or $7.70. The fair value of the shares as of the grant date was $320 thousand and will be amortized through December 31, 2025 based on the derived service\nperiods using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. On October 2, 2023, 20,000 of Mr. Schoening’s performance shares and 7,000 of Ms. Hawkins’ performance shares\nvested, resulting in the net issuance of 15,600 and 5,460 shares of common stock, respectively.\nOn May 1, 2023, the Company granted an aggregate of 39,000 restricted stock units to eleven employees under its 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. The restricted stock units will\nvest at a rate of 33.33% annually beginning on the anniversary date of the grant and any unvested restricted stock units will be forfeited if employment terminates prior to the\nrelevant vesting date. As of the grant date, assuming a 23.1% forfeiture rate based on expected turnover across the three years, the aggregate value of the restricted stock units is\n$90 thousand which will be amortized across the three-year period on a straight-line basis. On August 14, 2023, the Company granted an additional 3,000 restricted stock units\nto one new employee under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. The restricted stock units will vest at a rate of 33.33% annually beginning on the anniversary date of the grant and\nany unvested restricted stock units will be forfeited if employment terminates prior to the relevant vesting date. The fair value of the 3,000 restricted stock units at grant date\nwas $11 thousand. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, there were 3,000 restricted stock units forfeited.\n4\nNew Loan Agreement\nOn March 22, 2023, the Company and its subsidiary, Optex Systems, Inc. (collectively with the Company, the “Borrowers”), entered into a Business Loan Agreement (the\n“Loan Agreement”) with Texas Capital Bank (the “Lender”), pursuant to which the Lender will make available to the Borrowers a revolving line of credit in the principal\namount of $3 million (the “Texas Capital Facility”). The Texas Capital Facility replaced the Borrowers’ previous line of credit facility with PNC Bank, National Association,\nsuccessor to BBVA USA, which had been increased from $1.125 million to $2 million on November 21, 2022.\nThe commitment period for advances under the Texas Capital Facility is twenty-six months expiring on May 22, 2025. We refer to the expiration of that time period as the\n“Maturity Date.” Outstanding advances under the Texas Capital Facility will accrue interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus a specified\nmargin, subject to a specified floor interest rate. As of October 1, 2023 the interest rate was 8.07% per annum and is currently 8.08% per annum.\nThe Loan Agreement contains customary events of default (including a 25% change in ownership) and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing\nindebtedness, liens, fundamental changes (including changes in management), investments, and restricted payments (including cash dividends). The Loan Agreement also\nrequires the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 and a total leverage ratio of 3.00:1. The Texas Capital Facility is secured by substantially all\nof the operating assets of the Borrowers as collateral. The Borrowers’ obligations under the Texas Capital Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of\ndefault as defined in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement further provides for a $125,000 Letter of Credit sublimit.\nThe outstanding balance under the Texas Capital Facility was $1.0 million as of October 1, 2023.\nNASDAQ Listing\nOn March 14, 2023, the Company’s shares of common stock were listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol “OPXS.”\n2023 Equity Incentive Plan\nOn February 16, 2023, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”), under which 600,000 shares of common stock are\nreserved for issuance. The 2023 Plan permits the grant of stock options, performance shares, performance units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation\nrights to officers, other employees, individuals engaged to become officers or employees, consultants, advisors and non-executive directors of the Company. In connection with\nthe approval of the 2023 Plan, the Company’s 2016 Restricted Stock Unit Plan and 2009 Stock Option Plan were both canceled.\nRecent Orders\n● On November 14, 2023, the Company announced the award of a new contract from a U.S. Government Prime Contractor for Sighting Systems for $2.9 Million.

These coatings are manufactured at the Applied Optics Center (AOC) Division of the Company in Dallas, Texas.\nWe deliver high volume products, under multi-year contracts, to large defense contractors and government customers. Increased emphasis in the past several years has been on\nnew opportunities to promote and deliver our products in foreign military sales, where U.S.-manufactured combat and wheeled vehicles are supplied (and upgraded) in\ncooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense. We have a reputation for quality and credibility with our customers as a strategic supplier. We also anticipate the opportunity\nto integrate some of our night vision and optical sights products into commercial applications.\n6\nSpecific product categories by product line include:\nProduct Line Product Category\nPeriscopes Laser & Non-Laser Protected Plastic & Glass Periscopes, Electronic M17 Day/Thermal Periscopes, Vision Blocks\nSighting Systems Back Up Sights, Digital Day and Night Sighting Systems (DDAN), M36 Thermal Periscope, Unity Mirrors, Optical Weapon System\nSupport and Maintenance, Commander Weapon Station Sight (CWSS), Sight Assembly Refurbishment (GOI MOD/Aquila)\nHowitzers M137 Telescope, M187 Mount, M119 Aiming Device, XM10 Aiming Circle\nOther Muzzle Reference Systems (MRS), Binoculars, Collimators, Optical Lenses & Elements, Windows\nApplied Optics Center Laser Interference Filter, Optical Assemblies, Laser Filter Units, Day Windows, Binoculars, Specialty Thin Film Coatings.\nContracts\nSome of our contracts may allow for government contract financing in the form of contract progress payments pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.232-16, “Progress\nPayments”. Subject to certain limitations, this clause provides for government payment of up to 90% of incurred program costs prior to product delivery for small businesses\nlike us. To the extent any contracts allow for progress payments and the respective contracts would result in significant preproduction cash requirements for design, process\ndevelopment, tooling, material or other resources which could exceed our current working capital or line of credit availability, we intend to utilize this benefit to minimize any\npotential negative impact on working capital prior to receipt of payment for the associated contract deliveries.\nOur government contracts allow for Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.243-1 which entitles the contractor to an “equitable adjustment” for contract or statement of work\nchanges eaffecting cost or time of performance. In essence, an equitable price adjustment request is a request for a contract price modification (generally an increase) that\nallows for the contractor to be “made whole” for additional costs incurred which were necessitated by some modification of the contract effort. This modification may come\nfrom an overt change in U.S. Government requirements or scope, or it may come from a change in the conditions surrounding the contract (e.g., differing site conditions or late\ndelivery of U.S. Government-furnished property) which result in statement of work additions, deletions, part substitutions, schedule or other changes to the contract which\nimpact the contractor’s overall cost to complete.\nEach contract with our customers has specific quantities of material that need to be purchased, assembled, and then shipped. Prior to bidding for a contract, we contact potential\nsources of material and receive qualified quotations for each material. In some cases, the entire volume is given to a single supplier and in other cases, the volume might be split\nbetween several suppliers. If a contract has a single source supplier and that supplier fails to meet their obligations (e.g., quality, delivery), then we would attempt to find an\nacceptable alternate supplier, and if successful, we would then renegotiate contractual deliverables (e.g., specifications, delivery or price). As of December 6, 2023,\napproximately 9% of our material requirements are single-sourced across 13 suppliers representing approximately 27% of our active supplier order values. Single-sourced\ncomponent requirements span across all of our major product lines. Of these single-sourced components, we have material contracts (purchase orders) with firm pricing and\ndelivery schedules in place with each of the suppliers to supply the parts necessary to satisfy our current contractual needs. See “Item 1.A. Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our\nBusiness – Certain of our products are dependent on specialized sources of supply potentially subject to disruption which could have a material, adverse impact on our\nbusiness” for a description of certain supplier risks we face, which description is incorporated herein by reference.\nApproximately 92% of our contracts contain termination clauses for convenience. In the event these clauses should be invoked by our customer, future revenues against these\ncontracts could be affected. However, these clauses allow for a full recovery of any incurred contract costs plus a reasonable fee up through and as a result of the contract\ntermination. We are currently unaware of any pending terminations on our existing contracts.\n7\nIn some cases, contract awards may be issued that are subject to renegotiation at a date (up to 180 days) subsequent to the initial award date. Generally, these subsequent\nnegotiations have had an immaterial impact (zero to 5%) on the contract price of the affected contracts. Currently, none of our awarded contracts are subject to renegotiation.\nWe are subject to, and must comply with, various governmental regulations that impact, among other things, our revenue, operating costs, profit margins and the internal\norganization and operation of our business. The material regulations affecting our U.S. government business are summarized in the table below.\nRegulation Summary\nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) The principal set of rules in the Federal Acquisition Regulation System. This system consists of sets\nof regulations issued by agencies of the federal government of the United States to govern what is\ncalled the “acquisition process,” which is the process through which the government acquires goods\nand services. That process consists of three phases: (1) need recognition and acquisition planning, (2)\ncontract formation, and (3) contract administration. This system regulates the activities of government\npersonnel in carrying out that process. It does not regulate the purchasing activities of private sector\nfirms, except to the extent that those activities involve government solicitations and contracts by\nreference.\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) United States government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles\nand services on the United States Munitions List. These regulations implement the provisions of the\nArms Export Control Act.\nTruth in Negotiations Act (TINA) A public law enacted for the purpose of providing for full and fair disclosure by contractors in the\nconduct of negotiations with the government. The most significant provision included is the\nrequirement that contractors submit certified cost and pricing data for negotiated procurements above\na defined threshold of $2 million for contracts entered into after June, 30, 2018. The law requires\ncontractors to provide the government with an extremely broad range of cost or pricing information\nrelevant to the expected costs of contract performance, and it requires contractors and subcontractors\nto submit cost or pricing data to the government and to certify that, to the best of their knowledge and\nbelief, the data are current, accurate, and complete. A contracting officer may still request cost or\nprice data, if necessary, without certification, to determine whether the proposed cost or price is fair\nand reasonable for contracts which are below the threshold.\nWe are responsible for full compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Upon award, the contract may identify certain regulations that we need to meet. For\nexample, a contract may allow progress billing pursuant to specific FAR clauses incorporated into the contract. Other contracts may call for specific first article acceptance and\ntesting requirements. The FAR will identify the specific regulations that we must follow based on the type of contract awarded and contains guidelines and regulations for\nmanaging a contract after award, including conditions under which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, at the government’s convenience or for default. These\nregulations also subject us to financial audits and other reviews by the government of our costs, performance, accounting and general business practices relating to our\ngovernment contracts, which may result in adjustment of our contract-related costs and fees and, among other things and impose accounting rules that define allowable and\nunallowable costs governing our right to reimbursement under certain contracts.\nFirst Article Acceptance and Testing requirements consist of specific steps which could be comprehensive and time consuming. The dimensions and material specifications of\neach piece of the assembly must be verified, and some products may have in excess of 100 assembled parts. Once the individual piece parts are verified to be compliant to the\nspecification, the assembly processes are documented and verified. A sample of the production (typically three units) is verified to meet final performance specifications. Once\nthe units meet the final performance specification, they are then subjected to accelerated life testing, a series of tests which simulate the lifetime use of the product in the field.\nThis consists of exposing the units to thermal extremes, humidity, mechanical shock, vibration, and other physical exposure tests. Once completed, the units undergo a final\nverification process to ensure that no damage has occurred as a result of the testing and that they continue to meet the performance specification. All of the information and data\nis recorded into a final first article inspection and test report and submitted to the customer along with the test units for final approval. First Article Acceptance and Testing is\ngenerally required on new contracts/product awards but may also be required on existing products or contracts where there has been a significant gap in production, or where\nthe product has undergone significant manufacturing process, material, tooling, equipment or product configuration changes.\n8\nWe are also subject to laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information deemed classified for national security purposes and the\nexportation of certain products and technical data as covered by the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR). In order to import or export items listed on the U.S.\nMunitions List, we are required to be registered with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls office. The registration is valid for one year, and the registration fees are\nestablished based on the number of license applications submitted the previous year. We currently have an approved and current registration on file with the Directorate of\nDefense Trade Controls office. Once the registration is approved, each import/export license must be filed separately. License approval requires the company to provide proof\nof need, such as a valid contract or purchase order requirement for the specific product or technical data requested on the license and requires a detailed listing of the items\nrequested for export/import, the end-user, the end-user statement, the value of the items, consignees/freight forwarders and a copy of a valid contract or purchase order from the\nend-user. The approval process for the license can vary from several weeks to six months or more. The licenses we currently use are the Department of State licenses: DSP-5\n(permanent export), DSP-6 (license revisions) and DSP-73 (temporary export) and Department of Commerce: BIS-711 (export).\nThe above licenses are valid for 48 months from date that each license is issued. A summary of our active ITAR licenses is presented below (updated as of December 1, 2023):\nTotal Contract\nFiscal Year Number of Value of\nActive ITAR Licenses of Expiration Licenses Licenses\nDSP-5\nIssued 2020 2024 3 $ 51,365\nIssued 2021 2025 3 232,630\nIssued 2022 2026 4 321,722\nIssued 2023 (none issued) N/A — —\nTotal DSP-5 Licenses 10 $ 605,717\nDSP-6 (no active licenses) N/A — $ —\nDSP-73 (no active licenses) N/A — —\nBIS-711\nIssued 2020 2024 5 92,554\nIssued 2021 2025 4 323,911\nIssued 2022 2026 1 9,372\nIssued 2023 2027 10 1,359,344\nTotal BIS-711 Licenses 20 $ 1,785,181\nTotal All Licenses 30 $ 2,390,898\nThese licenses are subject to termination if a licensee is found to be in violation of the Arms Export Control Act or the ITAR requirements. If a licensee is found to be in\nviolation, in addition to a termination of its licenses, it can be subject to fines and penalties by the government.\nOur contracts may also be governed by the Truth in Negotiation Act (TINA) requirements where certain of our contracts or proposals exceed the TINA threshold ($2 million for\nawards after June 30, 2018), and/or are deemed as sole source, or non-competitive awards, covered under this act. For these contracts, we must provide a vast array of cost and\npricing data in addition to certification that our pricing data and disclosure materials are current, accurate and complete upon conclusion of the negotiation. Due to the\nadditional disclosure and certification requirements, if a post contract award audit were to uncover that the pricing data provided was in any way not current, accurate or\ncomplete as of the certification date, we could be subjected to a defective pricing claim adjustment with accrued interest. We have no history of defective pricing claim\nadjustments and have no outstanding defective pricing claims pending. Additionally, as a result of this requirement, contract price negotiations may span from two to six\nmonths and can result in undefinitized or not to exceed ceiling priced contracts subject to future downward negotiations and price adjustments. Currently, we do not have any\nundefinitized contracts subject to further price negotiation.\nOur failure to comply with applicable regulations, rules and approvals or misconduct by any of our employees could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the loss of\nsecurity clearances, the loss of our U.S. government contracts or our suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government generally, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are currently in compliance with all applicable regulations and do not have\nany pending claims as a result of noncompliance.\n9\nThe terms of our significant contracts as of December 6, 2023, are as follows:\nTotal Award Value Remaining Value\nCustomer Customer PO/Contract Contract Type (millions) (millions) Delivery Period\nUS Prime Contractor(1) Subcontract\nSighting Systems PO 35515590 FFPQ with Option years $ 4.0 $ 1.2 Oct 2017- Mar 2026\nDLA Land and\nMaritime(2) Prime\nPeriscopes SPE7LX-18-D-0108 IDIQ $ 2.4 $ 0.6 Feb 2020 - Jun 2024\nDLA Land and\nMaritime(3) Prime\nPeriscopes SPE7LX-19-D-0089 IDIQ $ 1.5 $ 1.1 Feb 2021 - Jul 2026\nDLA Land and\nMaritime(4) Prime\nPeriscopes SPE7LX-20-D-0020 IDIQ $ 1.1 $ 0.3 Dec 2021 – Jan 2024\nDLA Land and\nMaritime(5) Prime No task awards as of\nPeriscopes SPE7MX-20-D-0028 IDIQ $ - $ - current date\nDLA Land and\nMaritime(6) Prime No task awards as of\nPeriscopes SPE7MX-20-D-0032 IDIQ $ - $ - current date\nU.S. Prime Contractor(7) Subcontract Delayed Schedule\nXM10 Aiming Circles PO 63659 FFPQ $ 2.3 $ 2.3 Pending\nDLA Land and\nMaritime(8) Prime IDIQ $ 4.2 $ 1.2\nPeriscopes SPE7LX-21-D-0057 Sept 2021 – May 2024\nU.S. Prime Contractor(9) Subcontract\nLaser Filter Units (AOC) PO 631537 FFPQ $ 8.4 $ 2.6 Aug 2021 - July 2024\nUS Prime Contractor(10) Subcontract\nPeriscopes PO 40389248,40389250 FFPQ $ 1.7 $ 0.2 Feb 2022 - Jan 2024\nUS Prime Contractor(11) Subcontract\nLaser Filter Unit (AOC) PO 52960 FFPQ $ 1.0 $ 0.3 Nov 2022 - Dec 2023\nCommercial Customer(12)\nOptical Assemblies Subcontract\n(AOC) PO 28012 FFPQ $ 2.2 $ 0.6 Apr 2023 - Apr 2024\nCommercial Customer(13)\nOptical Assemblies Subcontract\n(AOC) PO 28043 FFPQ $ 1.1 $ 0.5 Jun 2023 - May 2024\n10\nUS Prime Contractor(14) Subcontract\nDay Windows (AOC) PO 40385578 IDIQ $ 1.9 $ 1.6 Dec 2022 - Sep 2025\nUS Prime Contractor(15) Subcontract\nPeriscopes PO 319216 FFPQ $ 0.7 $ 0.6 Jun 2023 - Aug 2024\nGovernment of Israel\nMOD(16)\nRefurbish Night Vision Foreign Military Sales Pending Revision (Jan\nEquip PO 4441236828 FFPQ $ 3.4 $ 3.4 2024 - 2025)\nDLA Land at\nAberdeen(17)\nLight Interference Filters Prime\n(AOC) SPRBL1-23-D-0001 IDIQ $ 3.6 $ 3.5 May 2023-May 2025\nDLA Land and Prime\nMaritime(18) SPE7LX-23-D-0092 IDIQ $ 1.6 $ 1.6 Mar 2024 – Jun 2024\nPeriscopes\nDLA Land and Prime\nMaritime(19) SPE7LX-23-D-0093 IDIQ $ 0.2 $ 0.2 May 2024 – Jun 2024\nPeriscopes\nUS Prime Contractor(20) Subcontract\nPeriscopes PO 23148 FFPQ $ 1.4 $ 1.4 Apr 2024 – Dec 2024\nUS Prime Contractor(21)\nLaser Interface Filters Subcontract\n(AOC) PO 921328 FFPQ $ 1.0 $ 1.0 Nov 2023 - Dec 2024\nACC-DTA(22) Prime\nM22 Binoculars (AOC) W56HZV-23-D-0071 IDIQ $ 0.5 $ 0.5 Aug 2024\nUS Prime Contractor(23) Subcontract\nLaser Filter Units (AOC) PO 450005346 FFPQ $ 1.1 $ 1.1 Jun 2024 - Jun 2025\nUS Prime Contractor(24) Subcontract\nLaser Filter Units (AOC) PO 4500045781 FFPQ $ 1.2 $ 1.2 Apr 2024 - Aug 2025\nUS Prime Contractor(25) Subcontract\nPeriscopes PO 40431189 FFPQ $ 1.7 $ 1.7 May 2024 - May 2025\nUS Prime Contractor(26) Subcontract\nSighting Systems PO 40431702 FFPQ $ 1.3 $ 1.3 Jul 2025 - Dec 2026\n(1) The original three-year contract was awarded on September 11, 2017 to provide LAV 6.0 optimized weapon system support for Optex’s Commander\nSighting System.

The chart below was derived from public\ngovernment spending sources and depicts total U.S. military spending from 2018 through 2023 and estimated spending through 2028. The purpose of including this chart is to\nprovide the reader with historical trend data and projected U.S. military defense and procurement spending over time. For fiscal year 2024, the total projected military spending\nis estimated at $863 billion, an overall increase of 11.9% over estimated 2023 spending. The chart below also depicts increased spending through 2028 of 6.1% from the 2024\nplan level, reflecting an average increase of 1.5% per year for years 2025 through 2028. Military procurement spending, a subset of total military spending, depicts an overall\nincrease of $15.3 billion, or 10.8%, in fiscal year 2024 as compared to the estimated spending in fiscal year 2023.\nThe National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2024 was enacted by Congress in December 2023 for $886 billion, an increase of $28 billion, or 3% over the\nprior year NDAA. The 2024 NDAA includes DOD military procurement of $169 billion, 8% above the Department of Defense procurement budget request of $156.4 billion.\nThe Chart below depicts the original estimated funding levels from the U.S. Department of Defense based on the FY2024 budget request.\nSource: Government Publishing Office, U.S. Budget Historical Tables, FY 2024, Table 3.2 Outlays by function and sub function, 1962-2028.\n14\nThe table below depicts the U.S. Department of Defense budget request for fiscal year 2024 for major ground system programs. The last five years have experienced a\nsignificant reduction in spending for U.S ground system military programs, and more specifically on the Abrams Tank Modifications/Upgrades, which has a direct impact on\nthe Optex Systems Richardson segment revenue. The total fiscal year 2024 budget request for major ground system programs decreased by 2.3% from the fiscal year 2023\nlevels and by 10.8% from the fiscal year 2020 levels. Although it is difficult to directly tie the budget request to specific components provided by Optex Systems, we provide\nperiscopes, collimator assemblies, vision blocks and laser interface filters to the U.S. armed forces on almost all of the ground system platforms categorized below.\n($ in Millions) FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023F FY2024B\nJoint Light Tactical Vehicle $ 1,716.5 $ 1,408.3 $ 1,046.6 $ 1,005.1 $ 1,183.8\nARMY\nAbrams Tank Modification/Upgrade 2,186.0 1,404.2 1,264.3 1,308.5 896.5\nArmored Multi-Purpose Vehicle 525.2 132.1 984.6 380.7 554.8\nPaladin Integrated Management 744.5 681.4 662.9 703.2 511.6\nFamily of Medium Tactical Vehicles 141.4 211.2 144.4 143.9 142.9\nFamily Of Heavy Tactical Vehicles 50.8 28.8 214.0 292.6 110.6\nNext Generation Squad Weapon 86.2 125.3 127.6 201.7 328.1\nGround Mobility Vehicle - - - -\nStryker 953.2 1,186.3 1,112.7 957.8 639.1\nUSMC\nAmphibious Combat Vehicle 349.3 478.1 591.9 618.6 660.8\nTotal Ground Systems Vehicles (millions) $ 6,753.1 $ 5,655.7 $ 6,343.9 $ 6,167.0 $ 6,024.9\nSource: Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, “Program Acquisition Cost by Weapon System, United States Department of Defense,\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Request”, March 2023 and “Program Acquisition Cost by Weapon System, United States Department of Defense, Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request”,\nApril 2022 and “Program Acquisition Cost by Weapon System, United States Department of Defense, Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request”, May 2021.\nThe 2024 Department of Defense Budget indicates an overall decrease in ground system vehicle program spending in the fiscal year 2023 and 2024 appropriation budget years.\nThere is generally a six- to eighteen-month delay between U.S. defense budget requests and program delivery orders related to our products from government agencies and our\nprime defense customers. In addition, DoD budget requests are often changed throughout the congressional NDAA Budgeting and Budget appropriations process. The DoD\nbudget requests exclude any foreign military sales as they are funded separately from the annual NDAA budgets. We are carefully watching the projected trends in both DoD\nmilitary spending and FMS as defense allocation priorities change, as well as challenges which are presented from the global recession and changes in political climate to\nascertain any potential impact to the Company’s future revenue.\nThe Applied Optics Center supports numerous other military platforms outside of the ground system vehicles budget, such as infantry rifle scopes, night vision monoculars,\ninfantry and navy binoculars, night goggles, and infrared aircraft filters. The Applied Optics Center has seen a substantial increase in orders from new and existing customers in\nsupport of the other platforms, which we expect to offset the impact of the ground systems reductions to their base revenue.\nMarket Opportunity — Foreign Military\nOur products directly support FMS combat vehicles globally, including Canada, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco, Egypt, South America, and Israel. We have\nincreased efforts to promote our proven military products, as well as newly improved product solutions directly to foreign military representatives and domestic defense\ncontractors supporting the FMS initiatives.\nWe were successful with the Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMOD) in refurbishing a small quantity of their Night Vision Rifle Scopes. Given this success, in November 2022, the\nIMOD awarded us a $3.4 million follow on contract to continue this activity. We anticipate deliveries against the contract to begin during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nIf we successfully execute this contract, we would expect another contract award of similar size and duration.\n15\nWe are also exploring possibilities to adapt some of our products for commercial use in those markets that demonstrate potential for solid revenue growth, both domestically\nand internationally.\nMarket Opportunity — Commercial\nOur products are currently sold to military and related government markets. We believe there may be opportunities to commercialize various products we presently manufacture\nto address other markets. Our initial focus will be directed in three product areas.\n● Big Eye Binoculars — While the military application we produce is based on mature military designs, we own all castings, tooling and glass technology. These large\nfixed mount binoculars could be sold to cruise ships, personal yachts and cities/municipalities. The binoculars are also applicable to fixed, land-based outposts for\nprivate commercial security as well as border patrols and regional law enforcement.\n● Thin Film Coatings — The acquisition of the Applied Optics Center (AOC) also creates a new sector of opportunity for commercial products for us. Globally,\ncommercial optical products use thin film coatings to create product differentiation. These coatings can be used for redirecting light (mirrors), blocking light (laser\nprotection), absorbing select light (desired wavelengths), and many other combinations. They are used in telescopes, rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, range\nfinders, protective eyewear, photography, etc. Given this broad potential, the commercial applications are a key opportunity going forward.\n● Optical Assemblies – Through the Applied Optics Center, we are utilizing our experience in military sighting systems to pursue commercial opportunities associated\nwith products that incorporate multi-lens optical cell assemblies, bonded optical elements and mechanical assemblies. There are a wide variety of products in the\nmedical, machine vision, automotive and outdoor recreation fields that can benefit from our capabilities. Support to domestic customers for these type products has\ndriven significant increases in Applied Optics Segment sales during the last five years.\nCustomer Base\nWe serve customers in four primary categories: as prime defense contractor (Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Land and Maritime, DLA Warren, DLA Aviation, U.S. Army,\nNavy and Marine Corps), as defense subcontractor (General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, Elbit Systems, BAE, Sig Sauer, Enterprise Cabling and Vortex Optics), as a\nmilitary supplier to foreign governments (Israel, Australia, South America and Canada) and also as a commercial optical assembly supplier (Nightforce Optics, Gables\nEngineering, Amazon). During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, we derived approximately 72% of our gross business revenue from five major customers: U.S.\ngovernment agencies (22%), three U.S. defense contractors (14%, 7%, and 6%) and one major commercial customer (23%). We have approximately 151 discrete contracts for\nitems that are utilized in vehicles, optical product lines and as spare parts. Due to the high percentage of prime and subcontracted U.S. defense revenues, large customer size\nand the fact that there are multiple contracts with each entity, which are not interdependent, we are of the opinion that this provides us with a fairly well diversified revenue\npool.\nMarketing Plan\nWe believe we are well positioned to service both U.S. and foreign military needs by our focus on delivering products that satisfy the following factors important to the U.S.\nmilitary:\n● Product reliability — failure can cost lives\n● Speed to delivery and adherence to delivery schedule\n● System life cycle extension\n● Low cost/best value\n● Visual aids for successful execution of mission objectives\n● Mission critical products specifically related to soldier safety.\n16\nPotential Entrants — Low Risk to us. In order to enter this market, potential competitors must overcome several barriers to entry. The first hurdle is that an entrant would need\nto prove to the government agency in question the existence of a government approved accounting system for larger contracts. Second, the entrant would need to develop the\nprocesses required to produce the product. Third, the entrant would then need to produce the product and submit successful test requirements (many of which require lengthy\ngovernment consultation for completion). Finally, in many cases, the customer has an immediate need and therefore cannot wait for this qualification cycle and therefore must\nissue the contracts to existing suppliers. Given the expense of development and qualification testing, the barrier to entry is high for new competitors.\nBuyers — Medium Risk to us. In most cases the buyers (usually government agencies or defense contractors) have two fairly strong suppliers. It is in their best interest to keep\nat least two, and therefore, in some cases, the contracts are split between suppliers. In the case of larger contracts, the customer can request an open book policy on costs and\nexpects a reasonable margin to have been applied.\nSubstitutes — Low Risk to us. We have both new vehicle contracts and replacement part contracts for the same product. Three combat vehicles have a long history of service in\nthe U.S. Army. The first M-1 Abrams Tank entered service with the Army in 1980; the M-2/M-3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle in 1981; and the Stryker Combat Vehicle in 2001.\nUnder current Army modernization plans, the Army envisions all three vehicles in service with Active and National Guard forces beyond FY2028. Optex Systems provides\nperiscopes and optical sighting systems in support of all three vehicle platforms. Since it was first fielded in 1980, the Abrams tank has undergone near-continuous upgrades\nand improvements; however, as illustrated above, spending on modifications and upgrades of the Abrams tank by the U.S. military has significantly decreased in the past five\nyears and we expect this trend to continue. The Abrams is the principal battle tank of the United States Army and Marine Corps, and the armies of Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,\nIraq, and since 2007, Australia. On average, there has been a new improvement package every seven years. The Army is currently upgrading the Abrams with a System\nEnhancement Package Version 3 (SEPv3), with additional upgrades in development. Additionally, the US Army has announced contracts to produce 742 Stryker DVH vehicles,\nredesigned (dual v-hulled vehicles) to be more resistant to land mines, as retrofits and as new production vehicles. The Abrams, Bradley and Striker vehicles are the only\nproduction tanks currently in production by the government. We believe that this, in conjunction with the 30-year life span, supports our expectation that they will continue to\nbe used through approximately 2040.\n17\nSuppliers — Low to Medium Risk to Optex Systems Holdings. The suppliers of standard processes (e.g., casting, machining and plating) need to be very competitive to gain\nand/or maintain contracts. Those suppliers of products that use top secret clearance processes have a slight advantage; however, there continues to be multiple avenues of\nsupply and therefore only moderate power.\nConsistent with our marketing plan and business model, the AOC acquisition strengthened our overall position by decreasing the bargaining power of their suppliers through\nthe backwards integration of a key supplier and created additional barriers of entry for potential competitors.\nThe following matrix reflects the current focus of our four basic approaches for sales and development:\n1) Sell existing products to existing customers.\n2) Sell existing products to new customers.\n3) Develop new products to meet the needs of our existing customers.\n4) Develop new products to meet the needs of new customers.\nExisting Customers New Customers\nNew Products Chile M17 Day/Thermal\nUSACC Binoculars Brazil M17 Day/Thermal\nIsrael M17 Day/Thermal, OWSS\nGDLS DDAN, OWSS\nU.S. Prime Contractor - XM10 Aiming Circle\nCommercial Optical Lens Commercial: Optical Lens, Spotting Scopes, Monocular Lens\nExisting Products USACC Periscopes, Back Up Sights, Marines Sighting Systems\nBinoculars, Vision Blocks,\nLaser Filter Units Commercial: Optical Lens, Spotting\nGDLS Periscopes, Collimators Scopes, Monocular Lens\nBAE Periscopes\nL3- Laser Interface Filters U.S. Prime Contractor – Laser Filter Units\nDLA Optical Elements\nOperations Plan\nOur operations plan can be broken down into three distinct areas: material management, manufacturing space planning and efficiencies associated with economies of scale.\n18\nMaterials Management\nThe largest portion of our costs is materials. We have completed the following activities in order to demonstrate continuous improvement:\n- Successful completion of annual surveillance audit for ISO 9001:2008 certificate, with no major nonconformance issues\n- Weekly cycle counts on inventory items\n- Weekly material review board meeting on non-moving piece parts\n- Kanban kitting on products with consistent ship weekly ship quantities\n- Daily cross functional floor meetings focused on delivery, yields and labor savings\n- Redesigned floor layout using tenant improvement funds\n- Daily review of yields and product velocity\n- Bill of material reviews prior to work order release\nFuture continuous improvement opportunities include installation and training of shop floor control module within the ERP system and organizational efficiencies of common\nprocurement techniques among buyers.\nManufacturing Space Planning\nWe currently lease 93,967 square feet of manufacturing space (see “Properties”). Our current facilities are sufficient to meet our immediate production needs without excess\ncapacity. As our processes are primarily labor driven, we are able to easily adapt to changes in customer demand by adjusting headcounts, overtime schedules and shifts in line\nwith production needs. In the event additional floor space is required to accommodate new contracts, Optex has the option to lease adjacent floor space at the current negotiated\nlease cost per square foot. Consistent with the space planning, we will drive economies of scale to reduce support costs on a percentage of sales basis. These cost reductions can\nthen be either passed through directly to the bottom line or used for business investment.\nOur manufacturing process is driven by the use of six sigma techniques and process standardization. Initial activities in this area have been the successful six sigma projects in\nseveral production areas which have led to improved output and customer approval on the aesthetics of the work environment. In addition, we use many tools including 5S\nprograms and six sigma processes, and define, measure, analyze, improve, control (DMAIC) problem solving techniques to identify bottlenecks within the process flow, reduce\ncost and improve product yields. Successful results can then be replicated across the production floor and drive operational improvements.\nEconomies of Scale\nPlant efficiencies fluctuate as a function of program longevity, complexity and overall production volume. Our internal processes are primarily direct labor intensive and can be\nmore easily adapted to meet fluctuations in customer demand; however, our material purchases, subcontracted operations and manufacturing support costs are extremely\nsensitive to changes in volume. As our volume increases, our support labor, material and scrap costs decline as a percentage of revenue as we are able to obtain better material\npricing, and scrap, start up and support labor (fixed) costs and they are spread across a higher volume base. Conversely, as production volumes decline, our labor and material\ncosts per unit of production generally increase. Additional factors that contribute to economies of scale relate to the longevity of the program. Long running, less complex\nprograms (e.g., periscopes) do not experience as significant of an impact on labor costs as production volumes change, as the associated workforce is generally less skilled and\ncan be ramped quickly as headcounts shift. Our more complex thin laser filter coatings, Howitzer and thermal day/night programs are more significantly impacted by volume\nchanges as they require a more highly-skilled workforce and ramp time is longer as the training is more complex. We continually monitor customer demand over a rolling\ntwelve-month window and in order to anticipate any changes in necessary manpower and material which allows us to capitalize on any benefits associated with increased\nvolume and minimize any negative impact associated with potential declines in product quantities.\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nDisclosure responsive to this item is incorporated herein by reference to “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Certain of our products are dependent on specialized\nsources of supply potentially subject to disruption which could have a material, adverse impact on our business.”\n19\nIntellectual Property\nWe utilize several highly specialized and unique processes in the manufacture of our products. While we believe that these trade secrets have value, it is probable that our future\nsuccess will depend primarily on the innovation, technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing abilities of our personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to\nmaintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or that our non-disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary\ninformation in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or other disclosure. The confidentiality agreements that are designed to protect our trade secrets could be\nbreached, and we might not have adequate remedies for the breach. Additionally, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how might otherwise become known or be\nindependently discovered by others. We possess three utility patents and three design patents.\nOur competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit\nor interfere with our ability to make and sell some of our products. Although we believe that our products do not infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of third\nparties, we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us or that such claims will not be successful.\nThe following patents generally expire 20 years after issuance.\nOn April 4, 2023, we were issued U.S. Patent No. 11,619,824 B2 titled “Selectable Offset Image Wedge” which is a mechanical wedge used to offset the image anywhere in the\nselectable range of circular travel within the defined offset field of view. This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent No. 10,324,298 and claims priority to U.S.\nPatent No. 10,324,298, issued on June 18, 2019.\nOn November 4, 2021 we were issued U.S. Patent No. 2021/0341746A1 titled “Selectable Offset Image Wedge” which is a mechanical wedge used to offset the image\nanywhere in the selectable range of circular travel within the defined offset field of view. This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent No. 10,324,298 and claims\npriority to U.S. Patent No. 10,324,298, issued on June 18, 2019.\nOn June 18, 2019 we were issued U.S. Patent No. 10,324,298 titled “Offset Image Wedge with Dual Capability and Alignment Technique”. The invention relates to an offset\nimage wedge for use on a bore-sighted rifle mounted directly onto the scope via a clamp mounting device. The wedge allows for a dual image which can be aligned in the field\nand provides the user with a choice of either a bore-sighted image or an offset image without removing the wedge.\nOn July 11, 2017, we were issued U.S. Patent No. D791,852 S, for our Red Tail Digital Spotting Scope. We have a retail sales relationship with Cabela’s Inc. and Amazon, to\ndistribute these scopes. They are currently the only digital spotting scope offered by Cabela’s. Our Red Tail Digital Spotting Scopes also received a favorable review from\nTrigger Magazine in 2017.\nIn May 2015, we announced the issuance to us of U.S. Patent No. 13,792,297 titled “ICWS Periscope”. This invention improves previously accepted levels of periscope\nperformance that, in turn, improve soldier’s safety.\nIn December 2013, Optex Systems, Inc. was issued U.S. Patent No. 23,357,802 titled “Multiple Spectral Single Image Sighting System Using Single Objective Lens Set.” The\ntechnology platform, designed for our DDAN program, is applicable to all ground combat vehicles used by the US and foreign militaries. This invention presents a single\nimage to both day and night sensors using precision optics, which in turn allows the user to individually observe day, night, or day and night simultaneously. In addition, it has\nproven to be especially useful in light transition points experienced at dusk and dawn. We are in production and currently delivering sighting systems with this advanced\ntechnology, a significant upgrade in the goal of supporting our customers as they modernize the worldwide inventory of aging armored vehicles. This technology is applicable\nto many sighting systems, and it has already been designed for implementation on the Light Armored Vehicles, the Armored Security Vehicle, the Amphibious Assault Vehicle,\nand the M60 Main Battle Tank. Digital Day and Night technology has advanced the capabilities of these installed weapon systems and is the first in a series of patents we have\napplied for to protect our Intellectual Property portfolio in support of the warfighters who use these systems.\n20\nIn May 2012, we purchased a perpetual, non-exclusive license, with a single up-front license fee of $200,000 to use Patent 7,880,792 “Optical and Infrared Periscope with\nDisplay Monitor” (issued in 2011 and owned by Synergy International Optronics, LLC). We believe the purchase of the license agreement may allow us to extend and expand\nour market potential for the M113APC vehicle type which has the highest number of commonly used armored vehicles in the world. The current estimated active M113 APC\nworldwide inventory is over 80,000 units. This licensing of this patent allows us to develop additional products for this vehicle type, including the M17 Day/Thermal and M17\nDay/Night periscopes. We are actively marketing the new periscopes internationally and completed our first international shipment utilizing this technology in March 2014. We\ncontinue to prototype these products and demonstrate them to potential customers.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our products are competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of our ability to design and engineer products to meet performance specifications set by our\ncustomers. Our customers include military and government end users as well as prime contractors that purchase component parts or subassemblies, which they incorporate into\ntheir end products. Product pricing, quality, customer support, experience, reputation and financial stability are also important competitive factors.\nThere are a limited number of competitors in each of the markets for the various types of products that we design, manufacture and sell. At this time, we consider our primary\ncompetitors for the Optex, Richardson site to be Kent Periscopes and Synergy International Optronics, LLC. The Applied Optics Center thin film and laser coatings products\ncompete primarily with Materion-Barr, Artemis and Alluxa.\nOur competitors are often well entrenched, particularly in the defense markets. While we believe that the quality of our technologies and product offerings provides us with a\ncompetitive advantage over certain manufacturers, some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do to spend on the research and\ndevelopment of their technologies and for funding the construction and operation of commercial scale plants.\nWe expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products. We cannot assure investors that our competitors will not develop enhancements\nto, or future generations of, competitive products that will offer superior price or performance features, or that new technology or processes will not emerge that render our\nproducts less competitive or obsolete. Increased competitive pressure could lead to lower prices for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition\nand results of operations. Also, competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost, and we may not be able to successfully develop or\nexpend the financial resources necessary to acquire new technology. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nWe had 106 full time equivalent employees as of October 1, 2023 and 102 employees as of December 6, 2023, which include a small temporary work force to handle peak\nloads as needed. We are in compliance with local prevailing wage, contractor licensing and insurance regulations, and have good relations with our employees, who are not\ncurrently unionized. We use outside consultants for various services. We have not experienced any work stoppages and are not a party to a collective bargaining agreement.\nManagement considers labor relations to be good.\nWe are dedicated to preserving operational excellence and remaining an employer of choice. We provide and maintain a work environment that is designed to attract, develop\nand retain top talent through offering our employees an engaging work experience that contributes to their career development. We recognize that our success is based on the\ncollective talents and dedication of those we employ, and we are highly invested in their success. We value our employees and believe that employee loyalty and enthusiasm are\nkey elements of our operating performance.\nCorporate History\nOptex Systems Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware corporation originally organized in Delaware as Sustut Exploration, Inc. in April 2006. Optex Systems, Inc. is a Delaware\ncorporation organized in September 2008. In March 2009, Optex Systems, Inc. engaged in a reverse merger with Sustut Exploration, Inc., in connection with which the latter\nwas renamed Optex Systems Holdings, Inc. and the former became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Optex Systems Holdings, Inc.\n21\nInternet Address\nThe Company maintains an internet website at the following address: www.optexsys.com. The information on the Company’s website is not incorporated by reference in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other\ninformation included or referred to in this Annual Report, before purchasing shares of our common stock. There are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may\nprevent us from achieving our goals. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of these risks actually materializes, our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors in our common stock could lose all\nor part of their investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not exclusive and are intended to reflect the material risks that are specific to us, our industry and\ncompanies that have securities trading on an over-the-counter market.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions globally and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses and\nlevels of business activity.\nEconomic and political events in the past few years have altered the landscape in which we and other U.S. companies operate in a variety of ways. In response to inflationary\npressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates, resulting in an increase in the cost of borrowing for us, our customers, our suppliers, and other companies relying\non debt financing. World events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting economic sanctions, have impacted the global economy, including by exacerbating\ninflationary and other pressures linked to COVID-related supply chain disruptions. In addition, the threat of a larger war in the Middle East after the Hamas terrorist attacks on\nIsrael could affect oil prices and have other, potentially recessionary, effects on the global economy. Prolonged inflationary conditions and prolonged periods of high interest\nrates could further negatively affect U.S. and international commerce and exacerbate or prolong the period of high energy prices and supply chain constraints. At this time, the\nextent and duration of these economic and political events and their effects on the economy and the Company are impossible to predict.\nLow unemployment and tight labor markets may adversely affect our labor costs and our ability to hire and retain a sufficient workforce required to meet the backlog and\ncustomer demands. If we are not able to maintain a sufficient workforce and attract and retain additional personnel as required, we may not be able to implement our\nbusiness plan and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe compete with several other large defense contractors, as well as homebuilding, industrial manufacturing and warehousing industries within the immediate area of our\nmanufacturing facilities for both lower and higher skill level manufacturing employees. The limited supply of available workers for hire, combined with increasing competition\namong other local industries, may result in increased production costs associated with higher wages, employee bonuses, overtime premiums and enhanced employee benefits in\naddition to cost increases associated with employee recruitment, employee turnover, training and learning curve inefficiencies. We may be unable to fill the labor positions\nrequired to meet our customer demands in a timely or cost-effective manner, which would impede our ability to meet current or increasing production levels in line with our\ncustomer expectations and adversely affect our ability to grow revenue or maintain our current margin levels.\nOur ability to fulfill our backlog may have an effect on our long-term ability to procure contracts and fulfill current contracts.\nOur ability to fulfill our backlog may be limited by our ability to devote sufficient financial and human capital resources and limited by available material supplies. Disruptions\nin our supply chain and transportation delays, combined with inflationary pressures and tight labor market conditions could impede our ability to meet customer requirements.\nIf we do not fulfill our backlog in a timely manner, we may experience delays in product delivery which would postpone receipt of revenue from those delayed deliveries.\nAdditionally, if we are consistently unable to fulfill our backlog, this may be a disincentive to customers to award large contracts to us in the future until they are comfortable\nthat we can effectively manage our backlog.\n22\nOur historical operations depend on government contracts and subcontracts. We face risks related to contracting with the federal government, including federal budget\nissues and fixed price contracts.\nFuture general political and economic conditions, which cannot be accurately predicted, may directly and indirectly affect the quantity and allocation of expenditures by federal\nagencies. Even the timing of incremental funding commitments to existing, but partially funded, contracts can be affected by these factors. Therefore, cutbacks or re-allocations\nin the federal budget could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Obtaining government contracts may also involve long purchase and payment cycles,\ncompetitive bidding, qualification requirements, delays or changes in funding, budgetary constraints, political agendas, extensive specification development, price negotiations\nand milestone requirements. In addition, our government contracts are primarily fixed price contracts, which may prevent us from recovering costs incurred in excess of\nbudgeted costs. Fixed price contracts require us to estimate the total project cost based on preliminary projections of the project’s requirements. The financial viability of any\ngiven project depends in large part on our ability to estimate such costs accurately and complete the project on a timely basis. Some of those contracts are for products that are\nnew to our business and are thus subject to unanticipated impacts to manufacturing costs. Even if our estimates are reasonable at the time made, prices of materials are subject\nto unanticipated adverse fluctuation. In the event our actual costs exceed the fixed costs determined under our product contracts, we will not be able to recover the excess costs\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We examine these contracts on a regular basis and accrue for anticipated losses on these\ncontracts, if necessary.\nWe have several multiyear IDIQ contracts at fixed prices which have open ordering periods and are currently at low profit rates or in a loss condition. These contracts are\ntypically three-year IDIQ contracts with two optional award years, and as such, we are obligated to accept new task awards against these contracts until the contract expiration.\nShould contract costs continue to increase above the negotiated selling price, or in the event the customer should release substantial quantities against these existing loss\ncontracts, the losses could be material. For contracts currently in a loss status based on the estimated per unit contract costs, losses are booked immediately on new task order\nawards. As of October 1, 2023, there was $243 thousand in accrued loss provisions for loss contracts or cost overruns.\nApproximately 92% of our contracts contain termination clauses for convenience. In the event these clauses should be invoked by our customer, future revenues against these\ncontracts could be affected, however these clauses allow for a full recovery of any incurred contract costs plus a reasonable fee up through and as a result of the contract\ntermination. We are currently unaware of any pending terminations on our existing contracts.\nIn some cases, contract awards may be issued that are subject to renegotiation at a date (up to 180 days) subsequent to the initial award date. Generally, these subsequent\nnegotiations have had an immaterial impact (zero to 5%) on the contract price of the affected contracts. Currently, none of our awarded contracts are subject to renegotiation.\nWe have sought to minimize the adverse impact from the slower pace of U.S. military orders on our results of operations by seeking to obtain foreign military orders, expanding\nour customer base as well as seeking new commercial business. We do not expect these markets to completely mitigate the negative impact of lower U.S. defense spending.\nIf we fail to scale our operations appropriately in response changes in demand, we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities,\nand our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nSignificant fluctuations in customer demand place a significant strain on our management personnel, infrastructure and resources. To implement our current business and\nproduct plans, we need to appropriately manage our cost base, as well as train, manage and motivate our workforce, while continuing to maintain our critical operational and\nfinancial systems and our manufacturing and service capabilities. All of these endeavors require substantial management effort and potential capital. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our operations to our customer demand levels, we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential\nmarket opportunities, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe do not have employment agreements with our key personnel, other than our Chief Executive and Financial Officers, and our management has minimal unencumbered\nequity ownership in us. If we are not able to retain our key personnel or attract additional key personnel as required, we may not be able to implement our business plan\nand our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend to a large extent on the abilities and continued participation of our executive officers and other key employees. The loss of either executive officer or any other key\nemployee could have a material adverse effect on our business. We currently have only two employment agreements. We do not presently maintain “key man” insurance on any\nother key employees. We believe that experienced personnel will continue to be required to implement our business plan. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we\ncannot assure you that they will be available when required, or that we will have the ability to attract and retain them. In addition, due to our small size, we do not presently\nhave depth of staffing in our executive, operational and financial management areas in order to have an effective succession plan should the need arise. Thus, in the event of the\nloss of one or more of our management employees, our results of operations could be vulnerable to challenges associated with recruiting additional key personnel, if such\nrecruiting efforts are not successful in a timely manner.\n23\nCertain of our products are dependent on specialized sources of supply potentially subject to disruption which could have a material, adverse impact on our business.\nWe expect recent supply chain disruptions driven by the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the related sanctions, combined with raw material shortages, labor\nshortages, transportation delays and inflationary pressures, to continue for the foreseeable future. These conditions have strained our suppliers and extended supplier delivery\nlead times, affecting their ability to sustain operations. We are experiencing market wide material shortages for paint and resin products as well as critical epoxies and chemicals\nused in our manufacturing process. In addition, we are seeing substantial increases in the costs of aluminum, steel and acrylic commodities. In addition, we have experienced\nsupplier schedule delays for other key components which are driven by supplier labor and material shortages. In several cases, spotty supply and material shortages have\nresulted in stocking higher inventory “safety stock” levels to ensure adequate lead time to replenish critical supplies.\nWe have selectively single-sourced some of our material components in order to mitigate excess procurement costs associated with significant tooling and startup costs.\nFurthermore, because of the nature of government contracts, we are often required to purchase selected items from U.S. government approved suppliers, which may further\nlimit our ability to utilize multiple supply sources for these key components.\nTo the extent any of these single sourced or government approved suppliers may have disruptions in deliveries due to production, quality, or other issues, we may also\nexperience related production delays or unfavorable cost increases associated with retooling and qualifying alternate suppliers. The impact of delays resulting from disruptions\nin supply for these items could negatively impact our revenue, our reputation with our customers, and our results of operations. In addition, significant price increases from\nsingle-source suppliers could have a negative impact on our profitability to the extent that we are unable to recover these cost increases on our fixed price contracts.\nEach contract has a specific quantity of material which needs to be purchased, assembled, and shipped. Prior to bidding on a contract, we contact potential sources of material\nand receive qualified quotations for this material. In some cases, the entire volume is given to a single supplier and in other cases; the volume might be split between several\nsuppliers. If a contract has a single source supplier and that supplier fails to meet their obligations (e.g., quality, delivery), then we would seek to find an alternate supplier and\nbring this information back to the final customer. Contractual deliverables would then generally be re-negotiated (e.g., specifications, delivery, price). As of December 1, 2023,\napproximately 9% of our material requirements are single-sourced across 13 suppliers representing approximately 27% of our active supplier order value. Single-sourced\ncomponent requirements span across all of our major product lines.\nWe consider it a material financial or schedule risk if we believe it will take us at least three months to identify and qualify a suitable replacement for specialized single source\nsuppliers. In the table below, we identify those specialized single source suppliers with respect to which we face such a material risk and the product lines supported by those\nmaterials utilized by us as of December 6, 2023.\nProduct Line Supply Item Risk Purchase Orders\nSighting Systems M36 Digital camera system Alternative source would take in excess of six months Current firm fixed price & quantity purchase\nDDAN to qualify orders are in place with the supplier to meet all\ncontractual requirements.\nPeriscopes Die-cast housings All die cast tooling is consolidated at this supplier.

Supplier is on\nschedule.\nThe defense technology supply industry is subject to technological change and if we are not able to keep up with our competitors and/or they develop advanced technology\nas response to our products, we may be at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe market for our products is generally characterized by technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product\nintroductions and enhancements, short product life cycles and severe price competition. Our competitors could also develop new, more advanced technologies in reaction to our\nproducts. Currently accepted industry standards may change. Our success depends substantially on our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance our\nexisting products and to develop and introduce new products that take advantage of technological advances and adhere to evolving industry standards. An unexpected change in\none or more of the technologies related to our products, in market demand for products based on a particular technology or of accepted industry standards could materially and\nadversely affect our business. We may or may not be able to develop new products in a timely and satisfactory manner to address new industry standards and technological\nchanges, or to respond to new product announcements by others. In addition, new products may or may not achieve market acceptance.\nUnexpected warranty and product liability claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe possibility of future product failures could cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products. We warrant the quality of our products to meet\ncustomer requirements and be free of defects for twelve months subsequent to delivery. We establish reserves for warranty claims based on our historical rate of returned\nshipments against these contracts. There can be no assurance that this reserve will be sufficient if we were to experience an unexpectedly high incidence of problems with our\nproducts. Significant increases in the incidence of such claims may adversely affect our sales and our reputation with consumers. Costs associated with warranty and product\nliability claims could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n25\nWe rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other companies, the size and\ncomplexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other\nsignificant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new\nsystems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards.\nOn July 13, 2021, we experienced a ransomware attack. While we do not expect that attack to have material adverse consequences, similar attacks, if not caught and effectively\naddressed in a timely manner, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the\nunauthorized access to personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or\nproprietary information and disrupt our operations. Any of these events may cause us to have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, be subject to legal claims\nand liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft\nof intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe derive almost all of our revenue from a small number of customers and the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nFor the year ended October 1, 2023, the Company’s consolidated revenues were derived from U.S. government agencies (22%), three U.S. defense contractors (14%, 7%, and\n6%), one major commercial customer (23%) and all other customers (28%). Approximately 95% of total Company revenue is generated from domestic customers and 5% is\nderived from foreign customers, primarily Canada. In particular, a decision by one of our major defense contract customers, U.S. government agencies, or major commercial\ncustomers to cease issuing contracts to us could have a significant material impact on our business and results of operations given that they represent over 72% of our gross\nbusiness revenue. There can be no assurance that we could replace these customers on a timely basis or at all.\nWe have approximately 151 discrete contracts with major defense contractors and the U.S. Government (primarily Defense Logistics Agencies (DLA), and other prime U.S.\ndefense contractors. If they choose to terminate these contracts, we are entitled to fully recover all contractual costs and reasonable profits incurred up to or as a result of the\nterminated contract.\nWe only possess six patents and rely primarily on trade secrets to protect our intellectual property.\nWe utilize several highly specialized and unique processes in the manufacture of our products, for which we rely solely on trade secrets to protect our innovations. We cannot\nassure you that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or that our non-disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets,\nknow-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or other disclosure. The non-disclosure agreements that are designed to\nprotect our trade secrets could be breached, and we might not have adequate remedies for the breach.\nIt is also possible that our trade secrets will otherwise become known or independently developed by our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than\nus, and these competitors may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for or obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell\nsome of our products. Although based upon our general knowledge (and we have not conducted patent searches), we believe that our products do not infringe on the patents or\nother proprietary rights of third parties; however, we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us or that such claims will not be successful.\n26\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future beyond any cash flow from our existing business; additional funds may not be available on terms that are acceptable\nto us, or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to finance our future working capital needs. We cannot assure you that any additional capital will be available on a timely\nbasis, on acceptable terms, or at all. Future equity or debt financings may be difficult to obtain. If we are not able to obtain additional capital as may be required, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe anticipate that our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n● our ability to fulfill backlog;\n● our ability to procure additional production contracts;\n● our ability to control costs;\n● the timing of payments and reimbursements from government and other contracts, including but not limited to changes in federal government military spending and\nthe federal government procurement process;\n● increased sales and marketing expenses;\n● technological advancements and competitors’ response to our products;\n● capital improvements to new and existing facilities;\n● our relationships with customers and suppliers; and\n● general economic conditions including the effects of future economic slowdowns, acts of war or terrorism and the current international conflicts.\nEven if available, financings may involve significant costs and expenses, such as legal and accounting fees, diversion of management’s time and efforts, and substantial\ntransaction costs. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to finance our operations, develop or enhance our products, expand our\nsales and marketing programs, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.\nRisks Related to our Credit Facility and Liquidity\nOur level of debt and restrictions in our credit agreement could negatively affect our operations and limit our liquidity and our ability to react to changes in the economy.\nOur Loan Agreement with Texas Capital Bank contains restrictive covenants that require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 and a total leverage ratio\nof 3.00:1, which we may fail to meet if there is a material decrease in our profitability or liquidity. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains restrictive covenants governing\nindebtedness, liens, fundamental changes (including changes in management), investments, and restricted payments (including cash dividends). The borrowings under the Loan\nAgreement are secured by substantially all of our operating assets as collateral.\nA breach of any of the restrictions and covenants could result in a default under our Loan Agreement, which, if not cured or waived, could cause any outstanding indebtedness\nunder the agreement (or under any future financing arrangements) to become immediately due and payable, and result in the termination of commitments to extend further\ncredit. We may not have sufficient funds on hand to repay the loan, and if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, or are unable to refinance at all,\nour results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates.\nIf our debt level significantly increases in the future, it could have significant consequences on our ongoing operations including requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of\nour cash flow from operations to servicing debt rather than using it to execute our strategic initiatives; limiting our ability to obtain additional debt financing for future working\ncapital, capital expenditures, or other worthwhile endeavors; and limiting our ability to react to changes in the market.\n27\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nOur stock typically trades in low volumes daily which could lead to illiquidity, volatility, or depressed stock price.\nOur stock is listed on Nasdaq, but typically trades in low daily volumes. Because of a history of low trading volume, our stock is relatively illiquid and its price may be volatile.\nThis may make it more difficult for our stockholders to resell shares when desired or at attractive prices. Some investors view low-volume stocks as unduly speculative and\ntherefore not appropriate candidates for investment. Also, due to the low volume of shares traded on any trading day, persons buying or selling in relatively small quantities\nmay easily influence prices of our stock.\nAny analysts covering our stock could negatively impact the stock price.\nThe trading market for our common stock will likely be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our\nmarket or our competitors. If any such analysts downgrade their evaluation of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. Furthermore, if our operating results fail to meet\nanalysts’ expectations, our stock price would likely decline.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be extremely volatile, and, as a result, stockholders may not be able to resell shares at or above their purchase price,\nand we may be more vulnerable to securities class action litigation.\nSince our common stock was listed on Nasdaq in March 2023, our stock price, as reported by Nasdaq, has ranged from a low of $2.87 to a high of $4.47. As a result, the market\nprice and trading volume of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile in the future, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease, which could be\nsubstantial, in the value of their stock, including decreases unrelated to our results of operations or prospects, and could lose part or all of their investment.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Because\nof the potential volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could result\nin substantial costs, divert management’s attention and resources from our business and adversely affect our business.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in SEC regulations, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our\ncommon stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” as defined under SEC regulations and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are\napplicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies including, among other things, reduced financial disclosure requirements including being\npermitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. As a result, our stockholders may not\nhave access to certain information that they may deem important. We could remain a smaller reporting company indefinitely. As a smaller reporting company, investors may\ndeem our stock less attractive and, as a result, there may be less active trading of our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in current economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to continue operations.\nChanges in current economic conditions may cause a decline in business, consumer and defense spending and capital market performance, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial performance. Our ability to raise funds, which could be required for business continuity or expansion of our operations, may be adversely affected by\ncurrent and future economic conditions, such as a reduction in the availability of credit, financial market volatility and economic recession.\n28\nIn the future, we may look to acquire other businesses in our industry and the acquisitions will require us to use substantial resources.\nIn the future, we may decide to pursue acquisitions of other businesses in our industry. In order to successfully acquire other businesses, we would be forced to spend\nsignificant resources for both acquisition and transactional costs, which could divert substantial resources in terms of both financial and personnel capital from our current\noperations. Additionally, we might assume liabilities of the acquired business, and the repayment of those liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our cash flow.\nFurthermore, when a new business is integrated into our ongoing business, it is possible that there would be a period of integration and adjustment required which could divert\nresources from ongoing business operations.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights to our directors, officers\nand employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nWe provide indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided by Delaware law. The foregoing indemnification obligation could result in our incurring\nsubstantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant\ncosts may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative\nlitigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.\nOur stock price is speculative, and there is a risk of litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following:\n● revenue or results of operations in any quarter failing to meet the expectations, published or otherwise, of the investment community;\n● speculation in the press or investment community;\n● wide fluctuations in stock prices, particularly with respect to the stock prices for other defense industry companies;\n● announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n● new products or the acquisition of significant customers by us or our competitors;\n● changes in investors’ beliefs as to the appropriate price-earnings ratios for us and our competitors;\n● changes in management;\n● sales of common stock by directors and executive officers;\n● rumors or dissemination of false or misleading information, particularly through Internet chat rooms, instant messaging, and other rapid-dissemination methods;\n● conditions and trends in the defense industry generally;\n● the announcement of acquisitions or other significant transactions by us or our competitors;\n● adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n● general market conditions;\n● domestic or international terrorism and other factors; and\n● other factors as described in this section.\n29\nFluctuations in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits. Although no such lawsuits are currently pending against us and we\nare not aware that any such lawsuit is threatened to be filed in the future, there is no assurance that we will not be sued based on fluctuations in the price of our common stock.\nDefending against such suits could result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention and resources. In addition, any settlement or adverse determination of such\nlawsuits could subject us to significant liability.\nAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions or\ntransactional counterparties, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nEvents involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in\nthe financial services industry, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity\nproblems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as receiver; on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership; and on May\n1, 2023, First Republic Bank failed and regulators sold substantially all of its assets to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The failure of First Republic Bank occurred despite a previous\nattempt by some of the nation’s largest banks to shore up First Republic’s capital. Although we assess our banking and customer relationships as we believe necessary or\nappropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could\nbe significantly impacted.\nIn addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or\ncosts and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing\non acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our\noperating expenses, financial obligations or other obligations, result in breaches of our contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws. Any\nof these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not described above, could have material adverse impacts on\nour liquidity and our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nItem 2. Properties\nWe are headquartered in Richardson, TX and lease approximately 93,967 combined square feet of facilities between Richardson, Texas and Dallas, Texas. We operate with a\nsingle shift, and capacity could be expanded by adding a second shift.\nWe renewed the lease on our 49,100 square foot, Richardson, Texas facility, effective as of January 11, 2021, for eighty-six (86) months, commencing on April 1, 2021 and\nending on May 31, 2028. Our Applied Optics Center, is located in Dallas, Texas with leased premises consisting of approximately 44,867 square feet of space. The Applied\nOptics Center lease was renewed on January 11, 2021 for eighty-six (86) months, commencing on November 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2028. The Applied Optics\nCenter amendment provides for a five-year renewal option at the end of the lease term at the greater of the then “prevailing rental rate” or the then current base rent rate.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including pending opposition proceedings involving patents that arise in the ordinary\ncourse of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNone.\n30\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket information\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “OPXS”.\nOn December 15, 2023, the closing price for our common stock was $4.15 per share.\nSecurities outstanding and holders of record\nOn December 15, 2023, there were approximately 80 shareholders of record for our common stock and 6,784,130 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.\nDividends\nWe have in the past paid dividends but we have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nOn May 9, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 40,000 shares of restricted stock to independent board member Dayton Judd. The shares vest 50% on each of\nJanuary 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025. As of the grant date, the fair value of the shares was $124 thousand, to be amortized on a straight-line basis through January 1, 2025. The\ngrant was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of such act and Rule 506 thereunder.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThere were no purchases made by or on behalf of the Company or any “affiliated purchaser” (as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) of its common stock under the Exchange Act)\nduring the three months ended October 1, 2023.\nItem 6. Reserved\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that are set forth in our financial statements\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThis management’s discussion and analysis reflects information known to management as of our fiscal year end, October 1, 2023, and the date of filing. This MD&A is intended\nto supplement and complement our audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended October 1, 2023, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP). You are encouraged to read our financial statements in conjunction with this MD&A. The financial information in this MD&A has been\nprepared in accordance with GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. In addition, we use non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental indicators of our operating performance\nand financial position. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for comparing actual results from one period to another, as well as for planning purposes. We will\nalso report non-GAAP financial results as supplemental information, as we believe their use provides more insight into our performance. When a non-GAAP measure is used in\nthis MD&A, it is clearly identified as a non-GAAP measures and reconciled to the most closely corresponding GAAP measure.\nThe following discussion highlights the principal factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations as well as our liquidity and capital resources for\nthe periods described. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see “Special cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements” and “Risk\nfactors” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these forward-looking statements. The operating results for the periods presented were not\nsignificantly affected by inflation.\nAll references in the following section to 2022 or 2023 with respect to our financial position and results of operations are to our fiscal years ended October 2, 2022 or October\n1, 2023, respectively.\n31\nBackground\nOptex Systems, Inc. manufactures optical sighting systems and assemblies for the U.S. Department of Defense, foreign military applications and commercial markets. Its\nproducts are installed on a variety of U.S. military land vehicles, such as the Abrams and Bradley fighting vehicles, light armored and advanced security vehicles and the\nStryker family of vehicles. Optex Systems, Inc. (Delaware) also manufactures and delivers numerous periscope configurations, rifle and surveillance sights and night vision\noptical assemblies. Optex Systems, Inc. (Delaware) products consist primarily of build-to-customer print products that are delivered both directly to the armed services and to\nother defense prime contractors. Less than 1% of our revenue is related to the resale of products substantially manufactured by others. In this case, the product would likely be a\nsimple replacement part of a larger system previously produced by Optex Systems, Inc. (Delaware).\nWe are both a prime and sub-prime contractor to the Department of Defense. Sub-prime contracts are typically issued through major defense contractors such as General\nDynamics Land Systems, Raytheon Corp., BAE, ADS Inc. and others. We are also a military supplier to foreign governments such as Israel, Australia and NAMSA and South\nAmerican countries and as a subcontractor for several large U.S. defense companies serving foreign governments.\nBy way of background, the Federal Acquisition Regulation is the principal set of regulations that govern the acquisition process of government agencies and contracts with the\nU.S. government. In general, parts of the Federal Acquisition Regulation are incorporated into government solicitations and contracts by reference as terms and conditions\neffecting contract awards and pricing solicitations.\nMany of our contracts are prime or subcontracted directly with the Federal government and, as such, are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 49.5, “Contract\nTermination Clauses” and more specifically Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses 52.249-2 “Termination for Convenience of the Government Fixed-Price)”, and 49.504\n“Termination of fixed-price contracts for default”. These clauses are standard clauses on our prime military contracts and generally apply to us as subcontractors. It has been\nour experience that the termination for convenience is rarely invoked, except where it is mutually beneficial for both parties. We are currently not aware of any material pending\nterminations for convenience or for default on our existing contracts.\nIn the event a termination for convenience were to occur, Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.249-2 provides for full recovery of all contractual costs and profits\nreasonably occurred up to and as a result of the terminated contract. In the event a termination for default were to occur, we could be liable for any excess cost incurred by the\ngovernment to acquire supplies from another supplier similar to those terminated from us. We would not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract\narises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Company as defined by Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.249-8.\nIn addition, some of our contracts allow for government contract financing in the form of contract progress payments pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.232-16,\n“Progress Payments”. Subject to certain limitations, this clause provides for government payment of up to 90% of incurred program costs prior to product delivery for small\nbusinesses like us. To the extent our contracts allow for progress payments, we intend to utilize this benefit, thereby minimizing the working capital impact on Optex Systems\nHoldings for materials and labor required to complete the contracts.\nMaterial Trends and Recent Developments\nRecent supply chain disruptions have strained our suppliers and extended supplier delivery lead times, affecting their ability to sustain operations. We anticipate market wide\nmaterial shortages for paint and resin products as well as critical epoxies and chemicals used in our manufacturing process. In addition, we are seeing substantial increases in\nthe costs of aluminum, steel and acrylic commodities, which has affected our net income in the year ended October 1, 2023 and is expected to continue to have a negative effect\non the margins expected to be generated under our long-term fixed contracts over the next three years. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business -\nCertain of our products are dependent on specialized sources of supply potentially subject to disruption which could have a material, adverse impact on our business.”\nWe have experienced significant material shortages during the year ended October 1, 2023 and extending into the first three months of fiscal year 2024 from several significant\nsuppliers of our periscope covers and housings. These shortages affect several of our periscope products at the Optex Richardson segment. The delays in key components,\ncombined with labor shortages during the year ended October 1, 2023, which continue into the first three months of fiscal year 2024, have negatively impacted our production\nlevels and have pushed the expected delivery dates into the first half of fiscal year 2024. We are aggressively seeking alternative sources and actively expediting our current\nsuppliers for these components as well as increasing employee recruitment initiatives and overtime to attempt to mitigate any continuing risks to the periscope line. While we\nare encouraged by recent improvements in supplier performance for the Optex Richardson segment periscope line which yielded increased revenue performance during the\nsecond through fourth quarters, our suppliers have yet to ramp up deliveries sufficiently to keep pace with our current customer demands. As such, we cannot give any\nassurances that expected customer delivery dates for our periscope products will not experience further delays.\n32\nIn March 2023, we moved our line of credit from PNC Bank to Texas Capital Bank and increased our available line of credit to $3.0 million from the previous $2.0 million line\nwith PNC. The increase in credit limit helps us meet our working capital requirements in light of the increased backlog and delay of revenues from the fiscal year 2023.\nWe refer also to “Item 1. Business – Market Opportunity: U.S. Military” for a description of current trends in U.S. government military spending and its potential impact on\nOptex, which may be material, including particularly the tables included in that section and disclosure on the significant reduction in spending for U.S ground system military\nprograms, which has a direct impact on the Optex Systems Richardson segment revenue, all of which is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe refer to “Item 1. Business – Recent Events” of this report for recent developments affecting the Company.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nWe have presented the operating results by segment to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. Management of Optex Systems Holdings uses\nthe selected financial measures by segment internally to evaluate its ongoing segment operations and to allocate resources within the organization accordingly. Segments are\ndetermined based on differences in products, location, internal reporting and how operational decisions are made. Management has determined that the Optex Systems,\nRichardson plant (to which we refer below as the Optex Systems segment or Optex Systems), and the Applied Optics Center, Dallas plant, which was acquired on November 3,\n2014 (to which we refer below as the Applied Optics Center segment or Applied Optics Center), are separately managed, organized, and internally reported as separate business\nsegments. The table below provides a summary of selective statement of operations data by operating segment for the years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022\nreconciled to the Audited Consolidated Results of Operations as presented in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.\nResults of Operations Selective Financial Info\n(Thousands)\nTwelve months ended\nOctober 1, 2023 October 2, 2022\nOther Other\nApplied (non- Applied (non-\nOptics allocated Optics allocated\nOptex Center costs and Optex Center costs and\nRichardson Dallas eliminations) Consolidated Richardson Dallas eliminations) Consolidated\nRevenue from External Customers $ 12,120 $ 13,539 $ - $ 25,659 $ 9,533 $ 12,850 $ - $ 22,383\nIntersegment Revenues - 893 (893) - - 879 (879) -\nTotal Segment Revenue 12,120 14,432 (893) 25,659 9,533 13,729 (879) 22,383\nTotal Cost of Sales 9,729 10,204 (893) 19,040 8,441 9,924 (879) 17,486\nGross Profit 2,391 4,228 - 6,619 1,092 3,805 - 4,897\nGross Margin % 19.7% 29.3% - 25.8% 11.5% 27.7% - 21.9%\nGeneral and Administrative Expense 3,121 464 247 3,832 2,613 475 162 3,250\nSegment Allocated G&A Expense (1,338) 1,338 - - (1,141) 1,141 - -\nNet General & Administrative\nExpense 1,783 1,802 247 3,832 1,472 1,616 162 3,250\nOperating Income (Loss) 608 2,426 (247) 2,787 (380) 2,189 (162) 1,647\nOperating Income (Loss) % 5.0% 16.8% - 10.9% (4.0)% 15.9% - 7.4%\nInterest Expense - - (55) (55) - - - -\nIncome (Loss) before taxes $ 608 2,426 (302) 2,732 $ (380) 2,189 (162) 1,647\nIncome (loss) before taxes % 5.0% 16.8% - 10.6% (4.0)% 15.9% - 7.4%\n33\nOur total external sales revenues increased by $3.3 million in the fiscal year 2023, or 14.6% compared to the 2022 fiscal year. The Optex Systems segment realized a $2.6\nmillion, or 27.1% increase, and the Applied Optics Center segment realized an increase of $0.7 million, or 5.4%, in external revenue compared to the prior year period.\nIntersegment revenues were $0.9 million for 2023 and 2022. Intersegment revenues relate primarily to coated filters provided by the Applied Optics Center to Optex Systems in\nsupport of the Optex Systems periscope line.\nGross profit increased $1.7 million and the gross margin percentage increased by 3.9 points from 21.9% in the 2022 fiscal year to 25.8% in the 2023 fiscal year. Optex Systems\ngross profit increased by $1.3 million and the gross margin percentage increased to 19.7% as compared to 11.5% in the prior year period on significantly higher revenue.\nApplied Optics Center gross profit increased by $0.4 million and the gross margin percentage increased to 29.3% as compared to 27.7% in the prior year period. The increase in\nconsolidated gross profit is primarily attributable to higher absorption of the fixed overhead cost base associated with higher revenue levels at both operating segments\ncombined with shifts in revenue mix in the Applied Optics Center.\nConsolidated general and administrative costs increased from $3.2 million for the twelve months ended October 2, 2022 to $3.8 million for the twelve months ended October 1,\n2023. During the years ended 2023 and 2022, Applied Optics Center absorbed $1.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of fixed general and administrative costs incurred by\nOptex Systems for support services. The increase in allocated general and administrative expenses during the 2023 year is directly attributable to the increase of $0.6 million in\ngeneral and administrative spending during the twelve-month period combined with a shift in revenue volume between segments. These expenses cover accounting, executive,\nhuman resources, information technology, board fees and other corporate expenses paid by Optex Systems and shared across both operating segments.\nConsolidated operating income increased by $1.2 million in the year ended October 1, 2023 to an income of $2.8 million as compared to the prior year operating income of\n$1.6 million. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to operating income of $1.0 million at the Optex Systems segment and increased operating income of\n$0.2 million at the Applied Optics Center segment on higher revenue and gross profit. The increased segment operating income is slightly offset by a decrease in operating\nincome of ($0.1) million in other unallocated costs for increases in general and administrative and interest costs as compared to the prior year.\nIncome before taxes increased $1.1 million, to $2.7 million in the 2023 fiscal year from a prior year income before taxes of $1.6 million. The increase in income before taxes\nyear over year is primarily due to the increase in revenue and gross profit in both segments.\nNew Orders and Backlog\nProduct backlog represents the value of unfulfilled customer manufacturing orders yet to be recognized as revenue. While backlog is not a non-GAAP financial measure, it is\nalso not defined by GAAP. Therefore, our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies. The booked backlog by\nperiod may also not be fully indicative of the predicted revenues for those periods as many of our orders provide for accelerated delivery without penalty and may additionally\nprovide customers the option to adjust schedules to meet their most recent projected demand quantities. However, we provide customer order and backlog information as we\nbelieve it provides significant insight into forward demand, with some predictive power to short term future revenues.\nDuring the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, the Company booked $34.6 million in new orders, representing a 23.6% increase from the prior year period orders of $28.0\nmillion. The orders for the most recently completed twelve months consist of $23.3 million for our Optex Richardson segment and $11.3 million attributable to the Applied\nOptics Center segment.\n34\nThe following table depicts the new customer orders for the twelve months ending October 1, 2023 as compared to the prior year period in millions of dollars:\n(Millions)\nTwelve months Twelve months\nended ended\nProduct Line October 1, 2023 October 2, 2022 Variance % Chg\nPeriscopes $ 15.9 $ 9.2 $ 6.7 72.8%\nSighting Systems 4.0 0.7 3.3 471.4%\nHowitzer - - - -%\nOther 3.4 3.6 (0.2) (5.6)%\nOptex Systems – Richardson 23.3 13.5 9.8 72.6%\nOptical Assemblies 1.9 6.7 (4.8) (71.6)%\nLaser Filters 7.6 4.7 2.9 61.7%\nDay Windows 0.3 1.9 (1.6) (84.2)%\nOther 1.5 1.2 0.3 25.0%\nApplied Optics Center – Dallas 11.3 14.5 (3.2) (22.1)%\nTotal Customer Orders $ 34.6 $ 28.0 $ 6.6 23.6%\nThe Company has seen significant increases in orders for many of its defense products during the fiscal year 2023 inclusive of two new customers for our sighting systems and\nfilter programs. On November 1, 2022, the Company announced it has been awarded a $3.4 million sighting system order to repair and refurbish night vision equipment for the\nGovernment of Israel. The order represents a significant increase in our Optex Richardson sighting systems business base for a new customer and includes an additional\npotential award value with a 100% optional award quantity clause. Deliveries under this contract are expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our Optex\nRichardson periscope orders have increased $6.7 million, or 72.8% over the prior year, including $9.0 million in task delivery awards against our long term IDIQ contracts. On\nJune 30, 2023, we booked a $3.0 million delivery order at our Applied Optics segment for the delivery of laser interface filters against a five-year IDIQ contract. On September\n18, 2023, the Company announced it was awarded a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract from the U.S. Government, for M22 (7 x 50) Binoculars\nwith an estimated value of $2.12 million. As of October 1, 2023, the Applied Optics Center had received task orders valuing $0.5 million against this award.\nThe Optex Systems Richardson segment currently has six open US Government IDIQ type military contracts for periscopes and two open IDIQ contracts with another prime\ncontractor for periscopes and unity mirrors with unspent funding which covers base year and option year requirement periods into 2029. We anticipate additional orders\nthroughout the next five years for these ongoing contracts. In addition, the Company has three open bid requests for new multi-year IDIQ contracts pending with the U.S.\nGovernment for additional periscopes that are expected to be awarded in the next twelve months.\nBacklog as of October 1, 2023 was $41.8 million as compared to a backlog of $32.9 million as of October 2, 2022, representing an increase of 27.1%.

Our projected periscope revenue over the next twelve months is currently exceeding our supplier and headcount capacity. We are\ncurrently working with our suppliers to ramp up material deliveries in addition to adding automated buffing equipment and manpower to increase production capacity in line\nwith our increasing customer demands over the next twelve months.\nSighting Systems product line backlog increased 176.5%, or $3.0 million, to $4.7 million, from our 2022 fiscal year end level of $1.7 million. The increased backlog is\nprimarily driven by the $3.4 million order from Israel for the repair and refurbishment of night vision equipment. Deliveries against the new award are expected to begin in the\nsecond fiscal quarter of 2024, pending the approval of export licenses.\nThe Howitzer contract awarded in July 2020 continues to experience customer driven delays related to customer furnished materials. This program is currently on hold pending\nstatement of work changes and materials furnished by the customer.\nOur backlog in other product groups increased by $1.2 million or 35.3% from $3.4 million in 2022 to $4.6 million in 2023 on new orders booked during the twelve months\nended October 1, 2023, primarily for muzzle reference systems and spare components for a major U.S. defense contractor, combined with $0.3 million in optical wedge\nassemblies for a commercial customer.\nApplied Optics Center – Dallas\nThe Applied Optics Center backlog decreased by $2.6 million, or 14.5%, for the year ended October 1, 2023, from $17.9 million in 2022 to $15.3 million in 2023.\nBacklog for our optical assemblies decreased by $4.0 million, or 58.8%, as compared to the prior year on lower customer demand from one of our commercial customers. We\nanticipate new order bookings during the next six months, although we are projecting an overall revenue reduction in optical assemblies of approximately 40% over the next\ntwelve months compared to fiscal year 2023.\n36\nLaser filter backlog increased by $1.2 million, or 13.8%, during the year due to $3.5 million in new order releases against our U.S. Government long term laser interface filter\ncontract in addition to several new orders booked from other U.S. defense contractors for laser interface filters and laser filter units. We are anticipating additional order\nbookings for delivery in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 and a substantial increase in laser filter revenue of 55-60% over the next twelve months from the 2023 levels.\nDay window backlog decreased by $0.3 million during the period as compared to the prior year as we continue to deliver against the existing orders from our ending 2022\nbacklog. We anticipate a slight increase in deliveries for day windows over the next twelve months based on the customer contract schedules.\nOther Applied Optics backlog increased by $0.5 million, or 125.0% for the year ended October 1, 2023, on new orders booked during the period for M22 binoculars. On\nSeptember 18, 2023, the Company announced it was awarded a 5-year IDIQ contract from the U.S. Government, for M22 (7 x 50) Binoculars with an estimated value of $2.12\nmillion and during the month of September, the Company received $0.5 million in task award orders against this contract. Deliveries against the contract are expected to begin\nin the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024.\nPlease refer to “Material Trends and Recent Events” above or “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for more information on recent developments and trends with respect to\nour orders and backlog, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe Company continues to pursue domestic, international and commercial opportunities in addition to maintaining its current footprint with U.S. vehicle manufactures, with\nexisting as well as new product lines. We are also reviewing potential products outside our traditional product lines. Further, we continue to look for strategic businesses to\nacquire that will strengthen our existing product line, expand our operations, and enter new markets.\nTwelve months ended October 1, 2023 compared to the twelve months ended October 2, 2022\nRevenues\nThe table below details the revenue changes by segment and product line for the year ended October 1, 2023 as compared to the year ended October 2, 2022.\nTwelve months ended\n(Millions)\nProduct Line October 1, 2023 October 2, 2022 Variance % Chg\nPeriscopes $ 8.6 $ 7.2 $ 1.4 19.4\nSighting Systems 1.0 0.8 0.2 25.0\nHowitzers - - - -\nOther 2.5 1.5 1.0 66.7\nOptex Systems – Richardson 12.1 9.5 2.6 27.4\nOptical Assemblies 5.6 4.9 0.7 14.3\nLaser Filters 6.4 5.9 0.5 8.5\nDay Windows 0.6 1.0 (0.4) (40.0)\nOther 1.0 1.1 (0.1) (9.1)\nApplied Optics Center – Dallas 13.6 12.9 0.7 5.4\nTotal Revenue $ 25.7 $ 22.4 $ 3.3 14.7\nOur total revenues increased by $3.3 million, or 14.7% in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. The Optex Systems Richardson segment realized a $2.6 million, or\n27.4%, increase in revenue and the Applied Optics Center segment realized an increase of $0.7 million, or 5.4%, in revenue compared to the prior year.\n37\nOptex Systems - Richardson\nRevenues on our periscope line increased $1.4 million during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 on higher customer demand and improved supplier\ndeliveries.\nRevenues on sighting systems increased by $0.2 million, or 25.0% from the prior year period due to shipments of $0.4 million in back up sights during the fourth quarter, offset\nby lower shipments against our OWSS repair contract.\nOptex Systems-Richardson revenue on other product lines increased by $1.0 million, or 66.7%, compared to revenues in the prior year due to increased revenues for optical\nwedge assemblies, day camera assemblies, unity mirrors and assorted spare part assemblies for both commercial and U.S. defense contractors.\nApplied Optics Center - Dallas\nRevenue on optical assemblies increased by $0.7 million, or 14.3%, during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 as compared to the prior twelve-month period on higher\ndemand on several rifle scope assemblies from one of our major commercial customers.\nLaser filter revenue increased by $0.5 million, or 8.5%, during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 as compared to the prior twelve-month period on higher demand for\nlaser interface filters and laser filter units from multiple defense contract customers.\nRevenues on our day windows decreased by $0.4 million, or 40.0%, during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 as compared to October 2, 2022 as we continue to ship\nagainst our existing customer contract schedule.\nApplied Optics Center revenue for other product lines decreased by $0.1 million, or 9.1%, during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 as compared to the prior twelve-\nmonth period on decreased revenue for unity mirrors.\nGross Margin. The gross margin for the year ended October 1, 2023 was 25.8% of revenue as compared to a gross margin of 21.9% of revenue for the year ended October 2,\n2022. Cost of sales increased by $1.6 million to $19.0 million for 2023 compared to $17.5 million for 2022. The gross profit increased by $1.7 million to $6.6 million in 2023\nas compared to $4.9 million in 2022. The increase is primarily due to higher revenue and shifts between segments and product lines combined with higher fixed cost absorption\nat both the Applied Optics Center and Optex Richardson segments related to increased production volume.\nG&A Expenses. For the years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, we recorded operating expenses of $3.83 million and $3.25 million, respectively. General and\nadministrative cost increases of $0.6 million, or 17.8%, for fiscal year 2023 as compared to the prior year, are primarily attributable to increases of $0.2 million relating to labor\nexpenses and $0.2 million relating to office, legal, IT and audit expenses, combined with a $0.1 million increase in stock compensation and a $0.1 million increase in bank fees.\nDuring the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, approximately $0.1 million of the increase in office and legal expense are directly related to our uplisting to the NASDAQ\nmarket in March 2023.\nOperating Income. For the year ended October 1, 2023, we recorded operating income of $2.8 million as compared to operating income of $1.6 million during the year ended\nOctober 2, 2022. The $1.2 million increase in operating income is primarily due to higher revenue and gross profit, partially offset by increased general and administrative\nexpenses.\nNet income applicable to common shareholders. During the year ended October 1, 2023, we recorded net income applicable to common shareholders of $2.3 million as\ncompared to net income applicable to common shareholders of $1.3 million during the year ended October 2, 2022. The increase of net income of $1.0 million is primarily\nattributable to the increase in operating profit, offset by increased interest expense of $0.1 million and increased income tax expense of $0.1 million over the prior year period.\n38\nNon GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\nWe use adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as an additional measure for evaluating the performance of our business as “net\nincome” includes the significant impact of noncash valuation gains and losses on warrant liabilities, noncash compensation expenses related to equity stock issues, as well as\ndepreciation, amortization, interest expenses and federal income taxes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance because it\npermits period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before the excluded items, which we do not consider relevant to our operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a\nfinancial measure not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. This non-GAAP measure\nexcludes certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not\ncalculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative measure.\nThe table below summarizes our twelve-month operating results for the periods ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, in terms of both the GAAP net income measure\nand the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA measure.\n(Thousands)\nTwelve months ended\nOctober 1, 2023 October 2, 2022\nNet Income — GAAP $ 2,263 $ 1,283\nAdd:\nFederal Income Tax Expense 469 364\nDepreciation 345 307\nStock Compensation 247 162\nInterest Expense 55 -\nAdjusted EBITDA - Non GAAP $ 3,379 $ 2,116\nOur Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.3 million to $3.4 million during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 as compared to $2.1 million during the twelve months ended\nOctober 2, 2022. The increase in EBITDA is primarily driven by increased revenue and operating profit during the current year as compared to the prior year twelve-month\nperiod. Operating segment performance is discussed in greater detail throughout the previous sections.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of October 1, 2023, Optex Systems Holdings had working capital of $13.5 million, as compared to $10.0 million as of October 2, 2022. During the twelve months ended\nOctober 1, 2023, we used operating cash of ($0.3) million, primarily driven by increased inventory, and spent ($0.4) million on acquisitions of property and equipment. During\nthe twelve months ended October 1, 2023, our net borrowing against the credit facility was $1.0 million.\nBacklog as of October 1, 2023 was $41.8 million as compared to a backlog of $32.9 million as of October 2, 3022, representing an increase of 27.1%. For further details, see\n“Results of Operations – New Orders and Backlog” above.\nThe Company has historically funded its operations through cash from operations, convertible notes, common and preferred stock offerings and bank debt. The Company’s\nability to generate positive cash flows depends on a variety of factors, including the continued development and successful marketing of the Company’s products. At October 1,\n2023, the Company had approximately $1.2 million in cash and an outstanding payable balance of $1.0 against its $3.0 million line of credit. As of October 1, 2023, our\noutstanding accounts receivable balance was $3.6 million, which has been collected during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, we paid down our\ncredit facility to zero.\nWe refer to the disclosure above under “Material Trends and Recent Developments” with respect to recent supply chain disruptions and material shortages, which disclosure is\nincorporated herein by reference.\n39\nIn the short term, the Company plans to utilize its current cash, available line of credit and operating cash flow to fund inventory purchases in support of the backlog growth\nand higher anticipated revenue during the next twelve months. Short term cash in excess of our working capital needs may be also be used to fund the purchase of product lines\nand other assets, including property and equipment required to maintain or meet our growing backlog, in addition to repurchasing common stock against our current stock\nrepurchase plan. Longer term, excess cash beyond our operating needs may be used to fund new product development, company or product line acquisitions, or additional stock\npurchases as attractive opportunities present themselves.\nIn some instances, new contract awards may allow for government contract financing in the form of contract progress payments pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation\n52.232-16, “Progress Payments.” Subject to certain limitations, this clause provides for government payment of up to 90% of incurred program costs prior to product delivery\nfor small businesses like us. To the extent any contracts allow for progress payments and the respective contracts would result in significant preproduction cash requirements\nfor design, process development, tooling, material or other resources which could exceed our current working capital or line of credit availability, we intend to utilize this\nbenefit to minimize any potential negative impact on working capital prior to receipt of payment for the associated contract deliveries. Currently none of our existing contracts\nallow for progress payments.\nWe refer to “Note 7 – Commitments and Contingencies – Rental Payments under Non-cancellable Operating Leases” for a tabular depiction of our remaining minimum lease\nand estimated CAM payments under such leases as of October 1, 2023, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe Company expects to generate net income and positive cash flow from operating activities over the next twelve months. To remain profitable, we need to maintain a level of\nrevenue adequate to support our cost structure. Management intends to manage operations commensurate with its level of working capital and line of credit facility during the\nnext twelve months and beyond; however, uneven revenue levels driven by changes in customer delivery demands, first article inspection requirements or other program delays\nassociated with the pandemic could create a working capital shortfall. In the event the Company does not successfully implement its ultimate business plan, certain assets may\nnot be recoverable.\nOn March 22, 2023, the Company and its subsidiary, Optex Systems, Inc. (“Optex”, and with the Company, the “Borrowers”), entered into a Business Loan Agreement (the\n“Loan Agreement”) with Texas Capital Bank (the “Lender”), pursuant to which the Lender will make available to the Borrowers a revolving line of credit in the principal\namount of $3 million (the “Credit Facility”). The commitment period for advances under the Credit Facility is twenty-six months expiring on May 22, 2025. We refer to the\nexpiration of that time period as the “Maturity Date.” Outstanding advances under the Credit Facility will accrue interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate\n(SOFR) plus a specified margin, subject to a specified floor interest rate. The interest rate is currently at 8.08% per annum. As of October 1, 2023, the interest rate was 8.07%\nper annum.\nThe Loan Agreement contains customary events of default (including a 25% change in ownership) and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing\nindebtedness, liens, fundamental changes (including changes in management), investments, and restricted payments (including cash dividends). The Loan Agreement also\nrequires the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 and a total leverage ratio of 3.00:1. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the\noperating assets of the Borrowers as collateral. The Borrowers’ obligations under the Credit Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default as\ndefined in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement further provides for a $125,000 Letter of Credit sublimit. As of October 1, 2023, there was $1.0 million borrowed under\nthe Credit Facility which was fully repaid during the first three months of fiscal year 2024. As of October 1, 2023, the Company is in compliance with all covenants under the\nCredit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility replaced the prior $2 million line of credit with PNC Bank, National Association.\nOn September 22, 2021 the Company announced authorization for an additional $1 million stock repurchase program. As of July 2, 2023, there was an authorized balance of\n$560 thousand remaining to be spent against the repurchase program. During the year ended October 1, 2023, there were no stock repurchases against the plan.\nDuring the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 the Company declared and paid no dividends. As of October 1, 2023, there are no outstanding declared and unpaid dividends.\n40\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nA critical accounting estimate is an estimate that:\n● is made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\n● involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty, and\n● has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operation.\nOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies require that we use estimates\nand assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. These policies are described in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”\nof Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.\nOur critical accounting estimates include warranty costs, contract losses and the deferred tax asset valuation. Future warranty costs are based on the estimated cost of\nreplacement for expected returns based upon our most recent experience rate of defects as a percentage of warranty covered sales. Our warranty covered sales primarily include\nthe Applied Optics Center optical assemblies. While our warranty period is 12 months, our reserve balances assume a general 90-day return period for optical assemblies\npreviously delivered plus any returned backlog in-house that has not yet been repaired or replaced to our customer. If our actual warranty returns should significantly exceed\nour historical rates on new customer products, significant production changes, or substantial customer changes to the 90-day turn-around times on returned goods, the impact\ncould be material to our operating profit. We have not experienced any significant changes to our warranty trends in the preceding three years and do not anticipate any\nsignificant impacts in the near term. We monitor the actual warranty costs incurred to the expected values on a quarterly basis and adjust our estimates accordingly. As of\nOctober 1, 2023, the Company had accrued warranty costs of $75 thousand, as compared to $169 thousand as of October 2, 2022. The primary reason for the $94 thousand\ndecrease in reserve balances relates to lower customer returns on warrantied product being sold during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, combined with a decrease in\ncustomer returned backlog pending repair or replacement to our customer as compared to the warranty backlog as of October 2, 2022.\nAs of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, we had $243 thousand, and $289 thousand, respectively, of contract loss reserves included in our balance sheet accrued expenses.\nThese loss contracts are related to some of our older legacy periscope IDIQ contracts which were priced in 2018 through early 2020, prior to Covid-19 and the subsequent\ndecline in revenue at the Optex Systems Richardson segment combined with significant inflationary pressures on materials and labor in the last two years. Due to inflationary\nprice increases on component parts and higher internal manufacturing costs (as a result of escalating labor costs and higher burden rates), some of these contracts are in a loss\ncondition, or at marginal profit rates. These contracts are typically three-year IDIQ contracts with two optional award years, and as such, we are obligated to accept new task\nawards against these contracts until the contract expiration. Should contract costs continue to increase above the negotiated selling price, or in the event the customer should\nrelease substantial quantities against these existing loss contracts, the losses could be material. For contracts currently in a loss status based on the estimated per unit contract\ncosts, losses are booked immediately on new task order awards. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, the accrued contract losses decreased by $46 thousand on\nshipments against the active IDIQ contract backlog combined with improvements in manufacturing overhead rates on higher revenue volume. There is no way to reasonably\nestimate future inflationary impacts, or customer awards on the existing loss contracts. We continue to monitor these contracts throughout the year for any significant changes\nin addition to seeking potential cost saving strategies to mitigate risk.\nAs of October 1, 2023, Optex Systems Inc. had a net carrying value of $0.9 million in deferred tax assets consisting of deferred tax assets of $1.7 million and valuation reserves\nof ($0.8) million. As of October 2, 2022, Optex Systems Inc. had a net carrying value of $0.9 million in deferred tax assets consisting of deferred tax assets of $1.8 million and\nvaluation reserves of ($0.9) million. The valuation allowance covers certain deferred tax assets where we believe we will be unlikely to recover those tax assets through future\noperations. The valuation reserve includes assumptions related to future taxable income which would be available to cover net operating loss carryforward amounts. Because of\nthe uncertainties of future income forecasts combined with the complexity of some of the deferred assets, these forecasts are subject to change over time. While we believe our\ncurrent estimate to be reasonable, changing market conditions and profitability, changes in equity structure and changes in tax regulations may impact our estimated reserves in\nfuture periods.\n41\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements are detailed under Note 3 of Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot applicable.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nOptex Systems Holdings, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Optex Systems Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022,\nand the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the twelve months then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 1, 2023 and October\n2, 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the twelve months then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Whitley Penn LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.\nDallas, Texas\nDecember 18, 2023\n42\nOptex Systems Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(Thousands, except share and per share data)\nOctober 1, 2023 October 2, 2022\nASSETS\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 1,204 $ 934\nAccounts Receivable, Net 3,624 2,908\nInventory, Net 12,153 9,212\nContract Asset 336 -\nPrepaid Expenses 219 328\nCurrent Assets 17,536 13,382\nProperty and Equipment, Net 998 968\nOther Assets\nDeferred Tax Asset 922 942\nRight-of-use Asset 2,740 3,222\nSecurity Deposits 23 23\nOther Assets 3,685 4,187\nTotal Assets $ 22,219 $ 18,537\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities\nAccounts Payable $ 810 $ 706\nOperating Lease Liability 620 604\nFederal Income Taxes Payable 247 331\nAccrued Expenses 1,265 958\nAccrued Selling Expense 336 -\nAccrued Warranty Costs 75 169\nContract Loss Reserves 243 289\nCustomer Advance Deposits 481 311\nCurrent Liabilities 4,077 3,368\nOther Liabilities\nCredit Facility 1,000 -\nOperating Lease Liability, net of current portion 2,282 2,761\nOther Liabilities 3,282 2,761\nTotal Liabilities 7,359 6,129\nCommitments and Contingencies\nStockholders’ Equity\nCommon Stock – ($0.001 par, 2,000,000,000 authorized, 6,763,070 and 6,716,638 shares issued and\noutstanding, respectively) 7 7\nAdditional Paid in Capital 21,285 21,096\nAccumulated Deficit (6,432) (8,695)\nStockholders’ Equity 14,860 12,408\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity $ 22,219 $ 18,537\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\n43\nOptex Systems Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(Thousands, except share and per share data)\nTwelve months ended\nOctober 1, 2023 October 2, 2022\nRevenue $ 25,659 $ 22,383\nCost of Sales 19,040 17,486\nGross Profit 6,619 4,897\nGeneral and Administrative Expense 3,832 3,250\nOperating Income 2,787 1,647\nInterest Expense 55 -\nIncome Before Taxes 2,732 1,647\nIncome Tax Expense, net 469 364\nNet income applicable to common shareholders $ 2,263 $ 1,283\nBasic income per share $ 0.34 $ 0.16\nWeighted Average Common Shares Outstanding -

(“the Company”) manufactures optical sighting systems and assemblies for the U.S. Department of Defense, foreign military applications and\ncommercial markets. Its products are installed on a variety of U.S. military land vehicles, such as the Abrams and Bradley fighting vehicles, light armored and advanced\nsecurity vehicles, and have been selected for installation on the Stryker family of vehicles. Optex Systems Holdings also manufactures and delivers numerous periscope\nconfigurations, rifle and surveillance sights and night vision optical assemblies. Optex Systems Holdings’ products consist primarily of build to customer print products that are\ndelivered both directly to the military and to other defense prime contractors or commercial customers. Optex Systems Holdings’ operations are based in Dallas and\nRichardson, Texas in leased facilities comprising 93,967 square feet. As of October 1, 2023, the Company operated with 106 full-time equivalent employees.\nNote 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nPrinciples of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Optex Systems Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Optex Systems, Inc. All\nsignificant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates.\nSegment Reporting: FASB ASC 280 requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. Operating\nsegments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in decisions\nregarding resource allocations and performance assessments. Generally, financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating\nsegment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Segments are determined based on differences in products, internal reporting and how operational\ndecisions are made. Management has determined that the Optex Systems, Richardson plant, and the Applied Optics Center, Dallas plant are separately managed, organized, and\ninternally reported as separate business segments. The FASB ASC 280 requires that a public business enterprise report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain specific\nrevenue and expense items, and segment assets. It requires reconciliations of total segment revenues, total segment profit or loss, total segment assets, and other amounts\ndisclosed for segments to corresponding amounts in the enterprise’s general-purpose financial statements.\nFiscal Year: Optex System Holdings’ fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest September 30. Fiscal year 2023 ended on October 1, 2023 and included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2022\nended on October 2, 2022 and included 52 weeks.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments: Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as\nof the financial statement presentation date.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, are carried at, or approximate, fair value as of the reporting date\nbecause of their short-term nature. The credit facility is reported at fair value as it bears market rates of interest.\nThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and\ndisclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions.\nThe accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. An asset or\nliability’s level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value estimates are reviewed at the origination date and again at each\napplicable measurement date and interim or annual financial reporting dates, as applicable for the financial instrument, and are based upon certain market assumptions and\npertinent information available to management at those times.\n47\nCash and Cash Equivalents: For financial statement presentation purposes, Optex Systems Holdings considers those short-term, highly liquid investments with original\nmaturities of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents. Optex Systems Holdings has $1.2 million in cash on deposit with our banks. Only a portion of the cash,\ncurrently $381 thousand, would be covered by federal deposit insurance and the uninsured balances are substantially greater than the insured amounts.\nConcentration of Credit Risk: The Company’s revenues for fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 are derived from sales to U.S. government agencies (22%), three U.S. defense\ncontractors (14%, 7%, and 6%), one major commercial customer (23%) and all other customers (28%). The Company’s revenues for fiscal year ended October 2, 2022 are\nderived from sales to U.S. government agencies (14%), three major U.S. defense contractors (22%, 15% and 7%), one major commercial customer (22%) and all other\ncustomers (20%). Optex Systems Holdings does not believe that this concentration results in undue credit risk because of the financial strength of the obligees.\nAccounts Receivable: Optex Systems Holdings records its accounts receivable at the original sales invoice amount less liquidations for previously collected advance/progress\nbills and an allowance for doubtful accounts. An account receivable is considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding beyond its scheduled due\ndate. On a quarterly basis, Optex Systems Holdings evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts, based on its history of past write-offs\nand collections, and current credit conditions. No interest is accrued on past due accounts receivable. As of October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022, Optex Systems Holdings had\nan allowance for doubtful accounts of $5 thousand, for non U.S. government account balances greater than 120 days. As the customer base is primarily U.S. government and\ngovernment prime contractors, Optex Systems Holdings allowance for doubtful accounts is minimal. Optex Systems Holdings charges uncollectible accounts to bad debt\nexpense in the period in which they are first deemed uncollectible. In the fiscal year 2023 we recognized zero in bad debt expenses associated with uncollectible accounts. In\nthe fiscal year 2022 we recognized $21 thousand in bad debt expenses associated with uncollectible accounts. Accounts receivable was $3,183 as of October 3, 2021.\nAs of October 1, 2023, 79% of the accounts receivable balance was comprised of six customers: the U.S. government, 17%, four major defense contractors, 21%, 9%, 8% and\n6%, and a commercial customer, 18%. As of October 2, 2022, 89% of the accounts receivable balance was comprised of eight customers: the U.S. government, 10%, five major\ndefense contractors, 14%, 12%, 9%, 8% and 7%, a commercial customer, 19%, and a foreign military customer, 10%.\nInventory: Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and adjusted as appropriate for decreases in valuation and obsolescence. Adjustments to the\nvaluation and obsolescence reserves are made after analyzing market conditions, current and projected sales activity, inventory costs and inventory balances to determine\nappropriate reserve levels. Cost is determined using the first-in first-out method. As of October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022 inventory included:\n(Thousands)\nAs of As of\nOctober 1, 2023 October 2, 2022\nRaw Materials $ 8,211 $ 6,953\nWork in Process 4,460 2,722\nFinished Goods 489 348\nGross Inventory 13,160 10,023\nLess: Inventory Reserves (1,007) (811)\nNet Inventory $ 12,153 $ 9,212\nIn the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 Optex Systems recorded $196 thousand of obsolete and excess inventory reserves. Net Inventory increased by $2.9 million in\nsupport of increased customer backlog and higher revenue.\n48\nWarranty Costs: Some of Optex Systems Holdings’ customers require that the Company warrant the quality of its products to meet customer requirements and be free of\ndefects for up to twelve months subsequent to delivery. Future warranty costs are based on the estimated cost of replacement for expected returns based upon our most recent\nexperience rate of defects as a percentage of warranty covered sales. Throughout the year, warranty costs are expensed as incurred, and as of each year end, Optex Systems\nHoldings reviews the prior 12-month warranty experience rate and may adjust the warranty accrual as required to cover any estimated warranty expenses associated with the\nperiod end backlog of returned customer units awaiting repair or replacement plus any estimated warranty expenses related to anticipated future returns on previous deliveries.\nAs of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, the existing warranty reserve balances of $75 thousand and $169 thousand, respectively, were reviewed and determined to be\nadequate to satisfy any future warranty claims that may have existed as of the end of each fiscal year for shipments occurring in the prior 12 months. We have made numerous\nimprovements to our supplier bases and internal production process to reduce the return rate on future shipments but will continue to review and monitor the reserve balances\nrelated to this product line against any existing warranty backlog and current trend data as we repair and replace our current warranty backlog and process future warranty\nreturns.\nThe table below summarizes the warranty expenses and incurred warranty costs for the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022.\nYears ended\n2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 169 $ 78\nIncurred costs for warranties satisfied during the period (133) (4)\nWarranty Expenses:\nWarranties reserved for new product shipped during the period(1) 223 198\nChange in estimate for pre-existing warranty liabilities (2) (184) (103)\nWarranty Expense 39 95\nEnding balance $ 75 $ 169\n(1) Warranty expenses accrued to cost of sales (based on current year shipments and historical warranty return rate).\n(2) Changes in estimated warranty liabilities recognized in cost of sales associated with: the period end customer returned warranty backlog, or the actual costs of\nrepaired/replaced warranty units which were shipped to the customer during the year. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, the warranty return rate was\nsignificantly below historical levels resulting in a favorable change in estimate during the period.\nProperty and Equipment: Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,\nranging from three to seven years. Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized. Expenditures for minor items, repairs and maintenance are charged to operations\nas incurred. Gain or loss upon sale or retirement due to obsolescence is reflected in the operating results in the period the event takes place.\nLeases: In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02—Leases (Topic 842). The update is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by\nrecognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this update are effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. As such, Optex Systems Holdings adopted these provisions as of the fiscal\nyear beginning on September 30, 2019. Optex Systems Holdings has two significant operating facilities leases which extend beyond twelve months and fall under the guidance\nof ASC Topic 842.\nOn January 11, 2021, the Company executed amendments extending the lease terms of both facilities for eighty-six months. As of the twelve months ended October 2, 2022,\nthe Company has recognized $51 thousand in right-of-use-asset and corresponding operating lease liabilities of $51 thousand for an office equipment lease expiring in\nDecember 2025. See also Note 7.\n49\nRevenue Recognition: The Company has adopted FASB ASC 606—Revenue from Contracts with Customers which requires revenue recognition based on a five-step model\nthat includes: identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price and recognizing the revenue.\nThe standard results in the recognition of revenue depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount reflecting the expected consideration to be\nreceived from the customer for such goods and services, based on the satisfaction of performance obligations, occurring when the control of the goods or services transfer to the\ncustomer. The majority of the Company’s contracts and customer orders originate with fixed determinable unit prices for each deliverable quantity of goods defined by the\ncustomer order line item (performance obligation) and include the specific due date for the transfer of control and title of each of those deliverables to the customer at pre-\nestablished payment terms, which are generally within thirty to sixty days from the transfer of title and control. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as\nfulfillment costs after the customer obtains control of the goods. In addition, the Company has one ongoing service contract which relates to optimized weapon system support\n(OWSS) and includes ongoing program maintenance, repairs and spare inventory support for the customer’s existing fleet units in service during the duration of the contract.\nRevenue recognition for this program has been recorded by the Company, and compensated by the customer, at fixed monthly increments over time, consistent with the defined\ncontract maintenance period. The total revenue recognized over time related to the contract is $455 thousand for the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 and $464 thousand\nfor the twelve months ended October 2, 2022.\nThe Company has on occasion, outside of the presented periods, received selective contract awards and modifications which included substantive milestone performance\nobligations, contract modifications, negotiated settlements and financing arrangements which could fall within the scope of FASB ASC 606 revenue recognition guidance on\nreoccurrence, and as such, the Company has expanded their contract review process to ensure any new contract awards, changes, modifications, financing arrangements or\npotential negotiated settlements are recorded in compliance to the new standard guidance.\nDuring the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 there was $242 thousand of revenue recognized from customer deposit liabilities (deferred contract revenue). During the\ntwelve months ended October 2, 2022, there was zero revenue recognized during the period from customer deposit liabilities (deferred contract revenue). As of October 1,\n2023, there was $336 thousand in accrued selling expenses and $336 thousand in contract assets related to a new $3.4 million contract booked in November 2022. The costs\nwill be amortized against the revenue for the contract deliveries expected to begin in the first half of fiscal year 2024 and extend through fiscal year 2025. As of October 2,\n2022, there was no significant contract assets or selling expenses.\nCustomer Advance Deposits: Customer advance deposits represent amounts collected from customers in advance of shipment or revenue recognition which relate to\nundelivered product due to non-substantive milestone payments or other cash in advance payment terms. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, Optex Systems, Inc. had a\nbalance of $481 thousand and $311 thousand, respectively, in customer advance deposits. Customer advance deposits were zero as of October 3, 2021.\nContract Loss Reserves: The Company records loss provisions in the event that the current estimated total revenue against a contract and the total estimated cost remaining to\nfulfill the contract indicate a loss upon completion. When the estimated costs indicate a loss, we record the entire value of the loss against the contract loss reserve in the period\nthe determination is made. The Company has several long-term fixed price contracts that are currently indicative of a loss condition due to recent inflationary pressures on\nmaterial and labor, combined with increased manufacturing overhead costs. As of October 1, 2023, the Company had contract loss reserves of $243 thousand which have been\nseparately itemized on the balance sheet. As of October 2, 2022, the Company had contract loss reserves of $289 thousand.\nGovernment Contracts: Many of Optex Systems Holdings’ contracts are prime or subcontracted directly with the Federal government and as such, are subject to Federal\nAcquisition Regulation (Federal Acquisition Regulation) Subpart 49.5, “Contract Termination Clauses” and more specifically Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses 52.249-2\n“Termination for Convenience of the Government (Fixed-Price)”, and 49.504 “Termination of fixed-price contracts for default”. These clauses are standard clauses on prime\nmilitary contracts and are required by the government to be “flowed down” by the prime contractor to any subcontractors used to perform work or provide components against\nthe award. It has been Optex Systems Holdings’ experience that the termination for convenience is rarely invoked, except where it has been mutually beneficial for both parties.\nOptex Systems Holdings is not currently aware of any pending terminations for convenience or default on its existing prime contracts or customer purchase orders.\n50\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets: Optex Systems Holdings follows the provisions of FASB ASC 360-10, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-\nlived Assets”. This standard requires, among other things, that long-lived assets be reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amounts may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre-\ntax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets, an impairment loss is\nrecognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. The measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair\nvalue of long-lived assets. No impairment of long-lived assets was recorded for the periods presented.\nStock-Based Compensation: FASB ASC 718 establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services,\nbut primarily focuses on transactions whereby an entity obtains employee services for share-based payments. FASB ASC 718 requires that the compensation cost relating to\nshare-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. It\nalso addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be\nsettled by the issuance of those equity instruments.\nIncome Tax/Deferred Tax: FASB ASC 740 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included\nin the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differing treatment of items for financial reporting and\nincome tax reporting purposes. The deferred tax balances are adjusted to reflect tax rates by tax jurisdiction, based on currently enacted tax laws, which will be in effect in the\nyears in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Under FASB ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in\nincome in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that Optex Systems Holdings\nwill not realize tax assets through future operations. When assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax\nliabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies and results of recent operations. Based on those estimates, management has determined that a portion of\nthe deferred tax assets may not be realized and has established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balance. We record uncertain tax positions in accordance\nwith ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical\nmerits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than\n50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nAs of October 1, 2023, Optex Systems Inc. has a net carrying value of $0.9 million in deferred tax assets represented by deferred tax assets of $1.7 million and a deferred tax\nasset valuation allowance of ($0.8) million against those assets. The valuation allowance has been established due to historical losses resulting in a Net Operating Loss\nCarryforward for each of the fiscal years 2010 through 2016 which may not be fully recognized due to an IRS Section 382 limitation related to a change in control occurring in\nfiscal year 2018. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, we reviewed the deferred tax assets and determined it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize a\nsubstantial portion of the deferred tax asset balance against future earnings. Our assumptions were based on the previous three years earnings trend as well as anticipated future\nearnings. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $0.5 million. During the twelve months ended October 2, 2022,\nthe Company recovered $0.3 million in cash for a tax refund related to a net operating loss carryback from the prior year ended October 1, 2022, and recognized an income tax\nexpense of $0.4 million. We will continue to review the deferred tax assets and related valuation reserves in accordance with ASC 740 on an annual basis.\nEarnings per Share: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available for common shareholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of common\nshares outstanding (the denominator) for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common\nstock were exercised or converted into common stock.\n51\nThe potentially dilutive securities that Optex Systems Holdings had outstanding were restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance-based shares. Optex Systems\nHoldings uses the Treasury Stock Method to compute the dilutive effect of these securities. Securities that are anti-dilutive are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings\nper common share.\nFor the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, 39,000 unvested restricted stock units, 120,000 restricted unvested shares and 27,000 performance shares (which converts to\n37,111 incremental dilutive shares) were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation as dilutive and 108,000 performance shares were excluded from diluted earnings\nper share as they were below the target share price. For the twelve months ended October 2, 2022, 66,000 unvested restricted stock units and 180,000 unvested restricted shares\n(which converts to 91,045 incremental dilutive shares) were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation as dilutive.\nNote 3 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nThere are no significant recent accounting pronouncements that affect the Company.\nNote 4 — Segment Reporting\nThe Company’s reportable segments are strategic businesses offering similar products to similar markets and customers; however, the companies are operated and managed\nseparately due to differences in manufacturing technology, equipment, geographic location, and specific product mix. Applied Optics Center was acquired as a unit, and the\nmanagement at the time of the acquisition was retained. Both the Applied Optics Center and Optex Systems – Richardson operate as reportable segments under the Optex\nSystems, Inc. corporate umbrella. For both segments, the chief operating decision maker is Danny Schoening, CEO.\nThe Applied Optics Center segment also serves as the key supplier of laser coated filters used in the production of periscope assemblies for the Optex Systems-Richardson\n(“Optex Systems”) segment. Intersegment sales and transfers are accounted for at annually agreed to pricing rates based on estimated segment product cost, which includes\nsegment direct manufacturing and general and administrative costs, but exclude profits that would apply to third party external customers.\nOptex Systems (OPX) – Richardson, Texas\nOptex Systems revenues are primarily in support of prime and subcontracted military customers. Approximately 86% of the Optex Systems segment revenue is comprised of\ndomestic military customers, and 11% is comprised of foreign military customers and 3% is comprised of commercial customers. Optex Systems segment revenue is derived\nfrom the U.S. government, 19%, and two major U.S. defense contractors representing 14% and 6%, of the Company’s consolidated revenue, respectively.\nOptex Systems is located in Richardson Texas, with leased premises consisting of approximately 49,100 square feet. As of October 1, 2023, the Richardson facility operated\nwith 59 full time equivalent employees in a single shift operation. Optex Systems, Richardson serves as the home office for both the Optex Systems and Applied Optics Center\nsegments.\nApplied Optics Center (AOC) – Dallas, Texas\nThe Applied Optics Center serves primarily domestic U.S. customers. Sales to commercial customers represent 46% and military sales to prime and subcontracted customers\nrepresent 54% of the total segment revenue. Approximately 94% of the AOC revenue is derived from external customers and approximately 6% is related to intersegment sales\nto Optex Systems in support of military contracts. For the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, the AOC segment revenue from one major commercial customer, and one\nmajor defense contractor represent approximately 23% and 7% of the Company’s consolidated revenue, respectively.\nThe Applied Optics Center is located in Dallas, Texas with leased premises consisting of approximately 44,867 square feet of space. As of October 1, 2023, AOC operated with\n47 full time equivalent employees in a single shift operation.\n52\nThe financial table below presents the information for each of the reportable segments profit or loss as well as segment assets for each year.

Richardson location and the Applied Optics Center Dallas location. The\nCompany also leases certain office equipment under non-cancellable operating leases.\nThe leased facility under Optex Systems Inc. located at 1420 Presidential Drive, Richardson, Texas consists of 49,100 square feet of space at the premises. The previous lease\nterm for this location expired March 31, 2021 and the monthly base rent was $24.6 thousand through March 31, 2021. On January 11, 2021 the Company executed a sixth\namendment extending the terms of the lease for eighty-six (86) months, commencing on April 1, 2021 and ending on May 31, 2028. The initial base rent is set at $25.3\nthousand and escalates 3% on April 1 each year thereafter. The initial term included 2 months of rent abatement for April and May of 2021.

In June 2021, PNC Bank completed its acquisition of BBVA, USA and the bank name changed to PNC Bank (“PNC”). The substantive terms were\nas follows:\n● The principal amount of the PNC Facility was $2.25 million. The PNC Facility matured on April 15, 2022. The interest rate was variable based on PNC’s Prime Rate\nplus a margin of -0.250%, initially set at 3% at loan origination, and all accrued and unpaid interest was payable monthly in arrears starting on May 15, 2020; and the\nprincipal amount was due in full with all accrued and unpaid interest and any other fees on April 15, 2022.\n● There were commercially standard covenants including, but not limited to, covenants regarding maintenance of corporate existence, not incurring other indebtedness\nexcept trade debt, not changing more than 25% stock ownership of Borrower, and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25:1, with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\ndefined as (earnings before taxes, amortization, depreciation, amortization and rent expense less cash taxes, distribution, dividends and fair value of warrants) divided\nby (current maturities on long term debt plus interest expense plus rent expense).\n● The PNC Facility contained commercially standard events of default including, but not limited to, not making payments when due; incurring a judgment of $10,000 or\nmore not covered by insurance; not maintaining collateral and the like.\n● The PNC Facility was secured by a first lien on all of the assets of Borrower.\n56\nOn April 12, 2022, the Borrowers entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the “PNC Loan Agreement”) with PNC, pursuant to which the Borrowers’ existing\nrevolving line of credit facility was decreased from $2.25 million to $1.125 million, and the maturity date was extended from April 15, 2022 to April 15, 2023.The PNC Loan\nAgreement required the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.\nOn November 21, 2022, the Borrowers issued an Amended and Restated Revolving Line of Credit Note (the “Line of Credit Note”) to PNC in connection with an increase of\nthe Borrowers’ revolving line of credit facility under the Loan Agreement from $1.125 million to $2.0 million. The maturity date remained April 15, 2023. Obligations\noutstanding under the credit facility accrued interest at a rate equal to the Lender’s prime rate minus 0.25%.\nThe Line of Credit Note and PNC Loan Agreement contained customary events of default and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing indebtedness,\nliens, fundamental changes, investments, and restricted payments. The PNC Facility was secured by substantially all of the operating assets of the Borrowers as collateral. The\nBorrowers’ obligations under the credit facility were subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Line of Credit Note and PNC Loan\nAgreement.\nAs of October 2, 2022 and October 1, 2023 the outstanding balance under the PNC Facility was zero. The PNC Facility was replaced by the Texas Capital Facility on March 22,\n2023.\nCredit Facility — Texas Capital Bank\nOn March 22, 2023, the Borrowers entered into a Business Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Texas Capital Bank (the “Lender”), pursuant to which the Lender\nwill make available to the Borrowers a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of $3 million (the “Texas Capital Facility”). The Texas Capital Facility replaced the $2\nmillion PNC Facility.\nThe commitment period for advances under the Texas Capital Facility is twenty-six months expiring on May 22, 2025. We refer to the expiration of that time period as the\n“Maturity Date.” Outstanding advances under the Texas Capital Facility will accrue interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus a specified\nmargin, subject to a specified floor interest rate. As of October 1, 2023 the interest rate was 8.07% per annum.\nThe Loan Agreement contains customary events of default (including a 25% change in ownership) and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing\nindebtedness, liens, fundamental changes (including changes in management), investments, and restricted payments (including cash dividends). The Loan Agreement also\nrequires the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 and a total leverage ratio of 3.00:1. The Texas Capital Facility is secured by substantially all\nof the operating assets of the Borrowers as collateral. The Borrowers’ obligations under the Texas Capital Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of\ndefault as defined in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement further provides for a $125,000 Letter of Credit sublimit.\nThe outstanding balance under the Texas Capital Facility was $1.0 million as of October 1, 2023.\nFor the year ended October 1, 2023, the total interest expense under the above facilities was $55 thousand. For the year ended October 2, 2022, the total interest expense under\nthe PNC Facility was zero.\n57\nNote 9 — Stock Based Compensation\nRestricted Stock, Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units issued to Directors, Officers and Employees\nThe following table summarizes the status of Optex Systems Holdings’ aggregate non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units, and performance shares:\nWeighted Weighted Weighted\nAverage Average Average\nRestricted Grant Grant Grant\nStock Date Fair Restricted Date Fair Performance Date Fair\nUnits Value Shares Value Shares Value\nOutstanding at October 3, 2021 99,000 $ 1.59 240,000 $ 1.75 — —\nGranted — — — — — —\nVested (33,000) 1.73 (60,000) 1.75 — —\nForfeited — — — — — —\nOutstanding at October 2, 2022 66,000 $ 1.52 180,000 $ 1.75 — —\nGranted 42,000 3.05 40,000 3.09 135,000 2.37\nVested (66,000) 1.52 (60,000) 1.75 — —\nForfeited (3,000) 3.00 (40,000) 1.75 — —\nOutstanding at October 1, 2023 39,000 $ 3.06 120,000 $ 2.20 135,000 $ 2.37\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company granted 150,000 and 50,000 restricted stock units with a January 2, 2019 grant date to Danny Schoening and Karen Hawkins, respectively,\nvesting as of January 1 each year subsequent to the grant date over a three-year period at a rate of 34% in year one, and 33% each year thereafter.

As of the grant date, the fair value of the\nshares was $124 thousand, to be amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2024. The Company amortizes the grant date fair value to stock compensation expense\non a straight-line basis across the five-year and two-year vesting periods beginning on April 30, 2020 and May 9, 2023, respectively. As of October 1, 2023, there\nwere 120,000 unvested restricted shares outstanding.\n58\nThe Company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Danny Schoening dated December 1, 2021.The updated employment agreement also served to\namend Mr. Schoening’s RSU Agreement, dated January 2, 2019, by changing the third and final vesting date for the restricted stock units granted under such agreement from\nJanuary 1, 2022 to the “change of control date,” that being the first of the following to occur with respect to the Company: (i) any “Person,” as that term is defined in Sections\n13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), with certain exclusions, is or becomes the “Beneficial Owner” (as that term is\ndefined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of\nthe Company’s then outstanding securities; or (ii) the Company is merged or consolidated with any other corporation or other entity, other than: (A) a merger or consolidation\nwhich would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being\nconverted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving\nentity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or (B) the Company engages in a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the\nCompany (or similar transaction) in which no “Person” (as defined above) acquires fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then\noutstanding securities. The amended RSU Agreement contains certain exceptions to the definition of change of control.\nAs of the December 1, 2021 modification date related to the third and final vesting date of the 49,500 unvested restricted stock units held by Danny Schoening, there was no\nchange in the fair value of the modified award as compared to the original award immediately prior to the modification date. The restricted stock units initially were certain to\nvest on January 1, 2022, but due to the modification, they were less certain to vest, contingent on a “change in control” occurring, which change in control, in case Mr.\nSchoening was terminated by the Company without cause or he resigns with good reason prior to such change in control, was required to occur prior to March 13, 2023. As of\nthe modification date, there was $5 thousand of unrecognized compensation cost associated with the original award. As a matter of expediency, the unrecognized compensation\nexpense as of the modification date was fully expensed through January 1, 2022. There is no additional compensation expense associated with the modification of the restricted\nstock unit agreement.\nOn January 4, 2022, the Company issued 23,216 common shares to Karen Hawkins, CFO, and Bill Bates (AOC GM), net of tax withholding of $19 thousand, in settlement\nof 33,000 restricted stock units which vested on January 1, 2022.\nOn November 28, 2022, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Danny Schoening which amended Mr. Schoening’s RSU Agreement, dated January 2,\n2019, which had been previously amended as of December 1, 2021, by changing the third and final vesting date for the restricted stock units granted under such agreement\nfrom the “change of control date” to January 1, 2023.\nOn January 4, 2023, the Company issued 46,432 common shares to Danny Schoening, CEO, and Bill Bates (AOC GM), net of tax withholding of $58 thousand, in settlement\nof 66,000 restricted stock units which vested on January 1, 2023.\nOn May 1, 2023, the Company granted an aggregate of 39,000 restricted stock units to eleven employees under its 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. As of the grant date, assuming a\n23.1% forfeiture rate based on expected turnover across the three years, the aggregate value of the restricted stock units is $90 thousand which will be amortized across the\nthree-year period on a straight-line basis. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, there were 3,000 restricted stock units forfeited. On August 14, 2023 there was an\nadditional grant of 3,000 restricted stock units to one new employee with a fair value of $11 thousand. The restricted stock units will vest at a rate of 33.33% annually on the\nanniversary date of the grant and any unvested restricted stock units will be forfeited if employment terminates prior to the relevant vesting date. As of October 1, 2023 there\nwere 39,000 unvested restricted stock units outstanding.\nOn May 3, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 100,000 and 35,000 performance shares to Danny Schoening, CEO, and Karen Hawkins, CFO, respectively. Each\nperformance share represents a contingent right to receive one share of common stock. The performance shares vest in five equal increments if, in each case and during a five-\nyear performance period beginning on October 2, 2023, the average VWAP per share of common stock over a 30 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds $3.70, $4.45,\n$5.35, $6.40, or $7.70. The fair value of the shares, as of the grant date, is $320 thousand and will be amortized through December 31, 2025 based on the derived service\nperiods using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model.\n59\nThe assumptions and results for the Monte Carlo simulation are as follows:\nAssumptions\nPerformance Period Start 10/2/2023\nPerformance Period End 10/1/2028\nTerm of simulation (1) 5.42 years\nTime steps in simulation 1,365\nTime steps per year 252\nCommon share price at valuation date (2) $ 3.04\nVolatility (annual) (4) 50.0%\nRisk-free rate (annual) (5) 3.37%\nCost of equity (6) 11.5%\nDividend yield (3) 0.0%\nTranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 Tranche 4 Tranche 5\nNumber of performance shares in the Tranche (1) 27,000 27,000 27,000 27,000 27,000\nFair Value of One Performance share (7) $ 2.75 $ 2.58 $ 2.39 $ 2.18 $ 1.93\nTotal Fair Value of Tranche $ 74,345 $ 69,742 $ 64,446 $ 58,819 $ 52,238\nDerived Service Period (Years) (7) 0.71 1.13 1.60 2.06 2.48\n(1) Based on the terms of the Performance Shares agreement issued by the Company on May 3, 2023.\n(2) Closing price of OPXS shares on the Valuation Date, as obtained via S&P Capital IQ.\n(3) Expected dividends provided by management.\n(4) Based on historical volatility of OPXS and comparable public companies.\n(5) Interest rate for US Treasury commensurate with the Performance Shares holding period, as of the Valuation Date, as obtained via S&P Capital IQ.\n(6) Estimated cost of equity for OPXS as of the Valuation Date.\n(7) Based on Monte Carlo simulation.\nStock Based Compensation Expense\nEquity compensation is amortized based on a straight-line basis across the vesting or service period as applicable.

The Company’s contribution expense for the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 were $163 thousand and $155 thousand, respectively.\nNote 11 — Stockholders’ Equity\nDividends\nThere were no dividends declared or paid during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022.\nCommon stock\nDuring the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, there were 46,432 common shares issued to officers, net of tax withholding of $58 thousand, in settlement of 66,000\nrestricted stock units which vested on January 1, 2023.\nDuring the twelve months ended October 2, 2022, there were 23,216 common shares issued to officers, net of tax withholding of $19 thousand, in settlement of 33,000\nrestricted stock units which vested on January 1, 2022.\nDuring the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, there were 40,000 unvested restricted shares cancelled on the departure of a board member and 40,000 unvested restricted\nshares granted to a newly elected board member.\nOn September 22, 2021 the Company announced authorization for a $1 million stock repurchase program. The shares authorized to be repurchased under the repurchase\nprogram may be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market or in negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and subject to\nRule 10b-18 as promulgated by the SEC.\nDuring the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, there were no common shares repurchased through the program.

On\nSeptember 15, 2022, the Company’s “modified Dutch auction” tender offer expired. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer, the Company accepted for\npurchase 1,603,773 shares of common stock at a price of $2.65 per share, for an aggregate cost of approximately $4.25 million, excluding fees and expenses relating to the\ntender offer.

The valuation allowance has been established due to historical losses resulting in a Net Operating Loss\nCarryforward for each of the fiscal years 2010 through 2016 which may not be fully recognized due to an IRS Section 382 limitation related to a change in control occurring in\nfiscal year 2018. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, we reviewed the deferred tax assets and determined it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize a\nsubstantial portion of the deferred tax asset balance against future earnings. Our assumptions were based on the previous three years earnings trend as well as anticipated future\nearnings. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, the Company recognized $20 thousand in tax expenses to deferred tax assets. During the twelve months ended\nOctober 2, 2022, the Company recognized $33 thousand in tax expenses to deferred tax assets.

A summary of the\ncomposition of the deferred income tax assets (liabilities) follows:\n(Thousands)\nDeferred Tax Asset\nAs of As of\nOctober 1, 2023 October 2, 2022\nStock Compensation $ 151 $ 76\nInventory Reserve 211 170\nUnicap 47 34\nDeferred Compensation 53 29\nProperty and Equipment (212) (219)\nGoodwill Amortization - 100\nIntangible Asset Amortization - 57\nContract Loss Reserve 51 61\nAccrued Paid Time Off 85 85\nNet Operating Losses 1,258 1,327\nOther 52 65\nSubtotal $ 1,696 $ 1,785\nValuation allowance (774) (843)\nNet deferred asset $ 922 $ 942\nThe Company has a net loss carryforward of $6.0 million as of October 1, 2023 as compared to a net loss carryforward of $6.3 million as of October 2, 2022. Due to an IRS\nsection 382 change in control limitation which was effective during the fiscal year ended 2017, it is anticipated that the Company may only realize $2.3 million of the current\nnet operating loss carryforward for a net tax benefit of $0.5 million through fiscal year ending in 2037. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, the Company\nrecovered $0.3 million in cash for a tax refund related to the net operating loss carryback from the October 3, 2021 year end.\nThe Company applied FASB ASC 740-10 and has no unrecognized tax benefits. By statute, the tax years ended October 1, 2023, October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021 are open\nto examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.\nDuring the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 the Company paid $534 thousand in income taxes. During the twelve months ended October 2, 2022 the Company paid zero\nin income taxes, received a tax refund of $312 thousand for fiscal year 2021 operating loss carrybacks, and recorded a current year federal income tax liability of $331 thousand\nwhich was paid during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023. As of October 1, 2023 the Company has recorded a tax liability of $247 thousand.\nNote 13 — Subsequent Events\nOn October 2, 2023, 27,000 performance shares vested with an average 30-day VWAP of $4.15 which exceeded the $3.70 benchmark for Tranche 1.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of October 1, 2023, management performed, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the report we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified\nin the SEC’s forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial\nOfficer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on the evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as\nof October 1, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the quarter ended October 1, 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projection of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has conducted, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, an assessment, including testing of the effectiveness,\nof our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2023. Management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting was conducted using the criteria in\nthe 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with our management’s assessment of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we have not identified any material weaknesses in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of October 1, 2023. We have thus concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 1, 2023.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nNone.\n64\nPART III\nItem 10.

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT\n(a) Forfeiture of Unvested Restricted Stock Units. If a Termination Event with respect to the Grantee occurs prior to the end of the Restricted Period for any reason\n(other than an Accelerated Vesting Event described in Section 2(b)(ii)), then the Restricted Stock Units that are unvested at that time shall be forfeited to the Company under\nSection 3(c). Restricted Stock Units that are vested at such time shall not be forfeited upon such Termination Event, but shall remain subject to this Agreement.\n(b) Leave of Absence. In addition, if the Grantee takes a military, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence from the Company and its subsidiaries, and the period\nof such leave exceeds 3 months, the Grantee will be considered to have terminated employment from the Company and its subsidiaries for purposes hereof on the later of (i) the\nfirst day immediately following such 3-month period, or (ii) the last day that the Grantee’s right to reemployment following the end of such leave is guaranteed by law or\ncontract with the Company or a subsidiary.\n(c) Effect of Forfeiture.

Any deferral election must be made in compliance with such rules and procedures as the\nCommittee deems advisable. If the Grantee is deemed a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, as determined by the Committee, at a time\nwhen the Grantee becomes eligible for settlement of the RSUs upon his “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then to the extent necessary\nto prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such settlement will be delayed until the earlier of: (i) the date that is six months following the\nGrantee’s separation from service and (ii) the Grantee’s death.\n(c) No Rights in Forfeited Units. To the extent that the Grantee does not vest in any Restricted Stock Units, all interest in such Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited.\nThe Grantee has no right or interest in any Restricted Stock Units that are forfeited.\n5.

DEFINITION\n(a) “Disability” means permanently and totally disabled within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n6. REGISTRATION\n(a) Timing of Registration. If the Company is advised by its counsel that shares deliverable upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units are required to be registered\nunder the Securities Act of 1933 (“Act”) or any applicable state securities laws, or that delivery of the shares must be accompanied or preceded by a prospectus meeting the\nrequirements of that Act or such state securities laws, and such registration has not then occurred or such prospectus has not then been delivered, then the Company will use its\nbest efforts to effect the registration or provide the prospectus within a reasonable time following the initial vesting date, but delivery of shares by the Company may be\ndeferred until the registration is effected or the prospectus is available. The Grantee shall have no interest in shares of Common Stock covered by the Restricted Stock Units\nuntil certificates for the shares are issued or such shares are issued in book-entry form.\n(b) Legend. If the shares deliverable upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units are not registered upon issuance, they shall bear the following legend, in addition to\nany other legend deemed necessary or desirable by the Committee:\nThe transferability of this certificate and the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to federal and state securities laws and, to the extent the issuance of such\nshares is not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on an effective registration statement, such shares are considered “restricted securities” for\npurposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be transferred in the absence of an opinion from counsel to the Company that such\ntransfer does not violate federal securities laws.\n3\n7.

LIMITED INTEREST\n(a) No Right to Employment or Service. The grant of this Award shall not confer on the Grantee any right to continue as an employee, nor interfere in any way with the\nright of the Company to terminate the Grantee as an employee at any time.\n(b) Capital Structure. The grant of this Award shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to make or authorize any or all\nadjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations, or other changes in the Company’s or any subsidiary’s capital structure or its business, or any merger, consolidation or business\ncombination of the Company or any subsidiary, or any issuance or modification of any term, condition, or covenant of any bond, debenture, debt, preferred stock or other\ninstrument ahead of or affecting the Common Stock or the rights of the holders of Common Stock, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any subsidiary, or any\nsale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business or any other Company or subsidiary act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.\n9.

The Company may\nrequire that the action or proceeding be determined in a bench trial.\nTHE GRANTEE ACKNOWLEDGES RECEIPT OF A COPY OF THE PLAN AND, IF ISSUANCE OF THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE AWARD IS\nREGISTERED AT THE TIME OF GRANT, OF THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-8 AND THE CORRESPONDING PLAN PROSPECTUS.\nALL PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD IS GRANTED UNDER AND PURSUANT TO THE PLAN, WHICH\nSHALL GOVERN ALL RIGHTS, INTERESTS, OBLIGATIONS, AND UNDERTAKINGS OF BOTH THE COMPANY AND THE GRANTEE.

SEVERABILITY\nIf any provision of this agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, or would disqualify this Award under any law the Committee\ndeems applicable, then such provision will be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable law, or if the Committee determines that the provision cannot be\nconstrued or deemed amended without materially altering the intent of this agreement, then the provision will be stricken and the remainder of this agreement will remain in full\nforce and effect.\n11.

Overview. The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Optex Systems Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) has adopted this Clawback Policy (the “Policy”) to provide for\nthe recovery of erroneously awarded executive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting\nrequirements under the federal securities laws. This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),\nRule 10D-1 thereunder (“Rule 10D-1”) and the applicable Nasdaq listing rules (the “Nasdaq Rules”).\nII. Administration. This Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (if composed entirely of independent directors, or in the absence\nof such a committee, a majority of independent directors serving on the Board) (the “Committee”). Any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on\nall affected individuals.\nIII. Covered Executives. This Policy applies to the Company’s current and former executive officers as defined in Rule 10D-1 from time to time, which at the\nEffective Date (as defined below) include the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the\ncontroller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who\nperforms a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company, and also applies to such other senior executives who\nmay from time to time be deemed subject to the Policy by the Committee (the “Covered Executives”).\nIV. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation; Accounting Restatement. In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to\nthe Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in\npreviously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (a “Big R” restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the\nerror were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a “little r” restatement), the Committee shall determine the amount of any excess Incentive-\nbased Compensation (as defined below) received (a) during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an\naccounting restatement (and if the Company changes its fiscal year, any transition period of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal\nyears) (b) by a person (i) on or after the effective date of the applicable Nasdaq listing rule, (ii) after beginning service as a Covered Executive, (iii) who served as a Covered\nExecutive at any time during the performance period for the Incentive-based Compensation award, (c) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities\nexchange or a national securities association.\nThe date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement is the earlier to occur of: (i) the date on which the Board, a committee of the Board, or any of\nthe Company’s officers authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, conclude or reasonably should have concluded that the Company is required to prepare\nsuch an accounting restatement or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare such an accounting restatement.\nThe date on which Incentive-based Compensation is deemed received is the Company’s first fiscal period during which the performance measure specified in the Incentive-\nbased Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the income-based compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nV. Incentive-based Compensation. For purposes of this Policy, “Incentive-based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based\nwholly or in part upon the attainment of any financial reporting measure, and includes, without limitation, any such compensation granted under the Company’s short-term\nincentive compensation programs, executive employment agreements, 2023 Equity Incentive Plan and any other compensation arrangements, programs or plans that the\nCompany may adopt from time to time in the future. For these purposes, a “financial reporting measure” is a measure determined and presented in accordance with the\naccounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and all other measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, including non-GAAP\nfinancial measures, stock price or total shareholder return. For the avoidance of doubt, a financial reporting measure need not be presented in the Company’s financial\nstatements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nVI. Excess Incentive-based Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery. The amount to be recovered shall be the excess of the Incentive-based Compensation\npaid to the Covered Executive based on the erroneous data over the Incentive-based Compensation that would have been paid to the Covered Executive had it been based on the\nrestated results, computed without regard to any taxes paid, all as determined by the Committee.\nIf the Committee cannot determine the amount of excess Incentive-based Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the information in the accounting\nrestatement, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement.\nVII. Method of Recovery. The Company will recover the amounts of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation reasonably promptly, as determined in\ncompliance with the applicable Nasdaq Rules. The Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recovering Incentive-based Compensation hereunder which\nmay include, without limitation:\n(a) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-based Compensation previously paid;\n(b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\n(c) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\n(d) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n2\n(e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Committee.\nTo the extent that any Covered Executive fails to repay any erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation to the Company when due, the Company shall take all\nactions reasonable and appropriate to recover such any erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation from the Covered Executive. The applicable Covered Executive\nshall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such erroneously awarded\nIncentive-based Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\nVIII. Prohibition of Indemnification and Waiver. The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executive against (a) the loss of any erroneously awarded\nIncentive-based Compensation or (b) any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. Further, the Company shall not enter into any agreement\nthat exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid or awarded to a Covered Executive from the application of this Policy or that waives the Company’s right\nto recovery hereunder, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date of this Policy).\nIX. Disclosure Requirements. The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable SEC filings and rules.\nX. Interpretation. The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the\nadministration of this Policy and for the Company’s compliance with Nasdaq Rules, Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 thereunder and any other applicable law,\nregulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq promulgated or issued in connection therewith.\nXI. Effective Date. This Policy shall be effective as of the date it is adopted by the Board (the “Effective Date”).\nXII. Amendment; Termination. The Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. The\nCommittee may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section XII, no amendment or termination of the Policy shall be effective if\nsuch amendment or termination would (after taking into account any action taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the\nCompany to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule or Nasdaq rule.\nXIII. Other Recovery Rights. The Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by applicable law and the Nasdaq Rules. Any\nemployment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan or similar agreement or arrangement entered into with a Covered Executive shall be deemed to include, as\na condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement by such Covered Executive to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment\nagreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. However, to the extent that the Covered Executive has\nalready reimbursed the Company for any erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation received under any duplicative recovery obligations established by the Company\nor applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation that is subject to\nrecovery under this Policy.\nXIV. Impracticability. The Committee shall recover any excess Incentive-based Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such recovery would be\nimpracticable, as determined by the Committee, in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and the applicable Nasdaq listing rule.\nXV. Successors. This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal\nrepresentatives.\n3\nATTESTATION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF CLAWBACK POLICY\nBy my signature below, I acknowledge and agree:\n1) that I have reviewed the attached Clawback Policy of Optex Systems Holdings, Inc.
