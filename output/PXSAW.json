In October 2024, the IMF slightly revised its estimate for annual global GDP\ngrowth to 3.2% for 2024 and 2025 due to better economic outlook for U.S. and emerging\nmarkets combined with lower inflation.\n► In November, IEA slightly reduced its global oil consumption estimates, projecting\naverage annual increases of 0.9 million barrels per day or ~1% for 2024 and 2025 primarily\ndue to decelerating Chinese demand growth, tighter efficiency standards and increasing\nReasonably\nEV usage.\nHealthy\n► OPEC+ announced that its voluntary oil production cuts of 2.2 Mb/d would unwind over\nChartering\nthe 12 months starting January, 2025; However, the impact of these cuts have been\nConditions\nmitigated by incremental supply from the U.S., Canada, Brazil and Guyana as well as\nSupported by\nongoing cheating by Iran; IEA also estimated Non-OPEC+ oil production would grow\nSolid annually at an average 1.5 Mb/d thru 2025, 80% of which would come from the Americas;\nFundamentals In the near-term, adequate crude supply should lead to moderating prices of oil products.\n& Limited\n► Q3 2024 saw easing of demand for refined petroleum products despite resilient economic\nProduct activity; In a number of locations, oil products inventories continue below 5-year averages;\nInventories Latest U.S. gasoline and diesel inventories 2% and 6%, respectively, below 5-year averages;\nHealthy increase YTD in European imports of road fuels; U.S. continues as world’s largest\nexporter of gasoline; Globally refinery crack spreads have declined with rising throughput\nforecasted, up 0.6% % to average 82.8 Mb/d in 2024, increasing to 83.4Mb/d in 2025.\n► Longer-term product tanker demand is further supported by increasing worldwide refinery\nthroughput and capacity additions (net 3.7 Mb/d by 2028 - Drewry), substantially from the\nMiddle East and Asia, driving ton-mile expansion, and growth in petroleum products\nexports from the U.S., Middle East, India and China.\n6\nPRODUCT TANKER MARKET UPDATE\nMAJOR GLOBAL EVENTS DRIVE CHARTERING ACTIVITIES\n► Russian-Ukrainian War has prompted a significant change to cargo routes and expansion of\nton-mile voyages; EU and G-7 countries ban on seaborne Russian refined products and price\ncaps, which started in early Feb. 2023, along with an increasing list of sanctions have created\nfurther market disruptions and complexity; Ukrainian air attacks have damaged Russia’s refining\ninfrastructure, further disturbing trade flows; Russian Urals crude currently trades at a 6% discount\nto Brent.\n► Since late 2023, the Israeli/Hamas conflict has led to over 120 attacks on vessels traveling the\nRed Sea/Gulf of Aden and cutting seaborne trade, further upsetting trade patterns with\nexpanding ton-mile activity; Danger of escalating tensions within region could compound\nmarket dynamics; Product tanker transits through the Suez Canal are down 60% from late last\nMajor Armed\nyear; Alternative voyages around the Cape of Good Hope typically add 15 sailing days from\nConflicts the ports in the Arabian Sea to Europe.\nContinue to\n► Increasing exports of refined products from U.S. Gulf, ME and certain parts of Asia traveling\nSupport\nlonger distances to end markets; According to Drewry, 2023 seaborne trade of refined products\nCharter Rates increased 2.4% YoY to over 1.04 billion tons, but ton-miles rose 4.6% to almost 3.58 trillion miles\nand sailing distances up 2.2%; Despite slowing growth in seaborne cargos of clean products,\nBut Increase\nClarksons estimates ton-miles have increased 6% YTD through September, 2024.\nVolatility\n► In Q3, product tanker charter rates experienced a seasonal decline but were still ~20% above 5–\nyear averages; Recent incursions by large crude carriers, which hurt demand for larger LRs,\nhave reportedly subsided, and charter rates are expected to improve into the historically strong\nwinter season combined with easing of scheduled refinery maintenance; Clarksons estimates\nproduct tanker demand growth of 2.9% in 2025.\n► Uneven economic activity amid destabilizing geo-political events combined with limited\ninventories create arbitrage opportunities for refined products in a number of markets and\nsupport the product tanker sector, but at the same time contribute to greater spot chartering\nvolatility; Uncertain weather patterns and climate change only add to the operating\ncomplexities facing the industry.\n7\nPOSITIVE MR2 SUPPLY OUTLOOK\nEstimated Annual Growth of ~ 2% in 2024 & 5% in 2025\n►Expanding MR2 tanker orderbook – Since the beginning of 2023, orders for new MR2 have risen\nsubstantially bringing the current orderbook (OB) to 307 MRs (42-60Kdwt.), which represented 16.5% of\nthe worldwide fleet of 1,856 MR2 tankers*.\n►Manageable delivery schedule – By YE 2025, 105 MR2 are scheduled for shipyard delivery with 202\nthereafter*; Yards now quote deliveries for 1H 2027 or later.\n►Slippage continues- Last year, 9.7% of new build MR2 were delayed from scheduled delivery dates,\nand the pace continues to be slow as only 30 tankers* were delivered during the first 10 months of\n2024; Ongoing concern due to tight labor conditions at many Asian shipyard, supply-chain\ndisruptions and delays from massive order books, primarily for other types of vessels.\n►Significant newbuild concerns remain for owners – New ordering hampered by high construction\nprices, limited yard slots with extended delivery dates, future technology/ship design concerns,\npricing and availability of alternative low-carbon fuels and increasing/ unclear environmental\nregulations; For example, only 16% of recent NB orders for MR2 included scrubbers according to\nDrewry.\n►Demolitions should pick-up over long-term – Only 4 MR2 scrapped in 2023 (zero YTD 2024*) due to\nstrong chartering environment and robust tanker values; Pace should pick-up as 254 MR2 are 20+ yrs.\nold (13.7% of global fleet)* based on expected vessel economic life of 25 years.\n►Implementation of New IMO regulations governing CO2 emissions (EEXI & CII) started in 2023 and are\nlimiting the availability of more efficient vessels, resulting in slower speeds, lower utilization and higher\nrunning costs for older vessels, as well as fragmentation in chartering.\n*Arrow Ship Brokering Group – November 2024 8\nPRODUCT TANKER MARKET UPDATE\nMR2 TANKER PRICES SUPPORT EQUITY VALUES\nHistorical\nSolid\nMR2 Type ($ million) Nov. 2024* Average ** Difference\nChartering,\nPositive Long-\nterm Industry\nNew Build (delivery in 1H‘27) *** $ 51.6 $ 37.1 +39%\nFundamentals\n& High New\nEco – Efficient 5 yr.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before certain non-operating or non-\nrecurring charges, such as, vessel impairment charges, gain or loss from debt extinguishment, gain or loss on sale of vessel, gain or loss from\nfinancial derivative instrument, interest income and stock compensation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under\nU.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented as we believe that they provide investors with means of evaluating and understanding\nhow our management evaluates operating performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes\nfor, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures do not have standardized\nmeanings, and are therefore, unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not\nreflect cash requirements for capital expenditures or debt service, nor changes in working capital.\nDaily time charter equivalent (“TCE”) rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure of the average daily revenue performance of a\nvessel on a per voyage basis. TCE is not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We utilize TCE because we believe it is a meaningful measure\nto compare period-to-period changes in our performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters and\nbareboat charters) under which our vessels may be employed between the periods. Our management also utilizes TCE to assist them in making\ndecisions regarding employment of the vessels. We calculate TCE by dividing revenues, net after deducting voyage related costs and\ncommissions by operating days for the relevant period. Voyage related costs and commissions primarily consist of brokerage commissions, port,\ncanal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter contract.\nVessel operating expenses (“Opex”) per day are our vessel operating expenses for a vessel, which primarily consist of crew wages and related\ncosts, insurance, lube oils, communications, spares and consumables, tonnage taxes as well as repairs and maintenance, divided by the\nownership days in the applicable period.\nWe define total daily operational costs as vessel Opex, technical and commercial management fees plus allocable general and administrative\nexpenses, applied on a daily basis, typically in comparison of our eco-efficient and eco-modified MR’s. These costs can vary period to period by\nfleet composition, vessel delivery, operating structure, management organization and dry-dockings.\nWe calculate fleet utilization (“Utilization”) by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during the\nsame period. We use fleet utilization to measure our efficiency in finding suitable employment for our vessels and minimizing the amount of days\nthat our vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys and\nintermediate dry-dockings or vessel positioning. Ownership days are the total number of days in a period during which we owned each of the\nvessels in our fleet. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues generated and\nthe amount of expenses incurred during the respective period. Available days are the number of ownership days in a period, less the aggregate\nnumber of days that our vessels were off-hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys and\nintermediate dry-dockings and the aggregate number of days that we spent positioning our vessels during the respective period for such repairs,\nupgrades and surveys. Available days measures the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of\ngenerating revenues. Operating days are the number of available days in a period, less the aggregate number of days that our vessels were off-\nhire or out of service due to any reason, including technical breakdowns and unforeseen circumstances. Operating days measures the\naggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues.\n19\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nEXHIBIT II\nEXHIBIT II | NON-GAAP MEASURES\nThree months ended Nine months ended\n(Aamounts in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nReconciliation of Net income to EBITDA and\n2023 2024 2023 2024\nAdjusted EBITDA\nNet income $ 3 ,080 $ 3 ,478 $ 14,950 $ 12,373\nDepreciation 1,317 1,905 3,951 5,000\nAmortization of special survey costs 98 98 274 292\nInterest and finance costs 1,393 1,825 4,201 4,898\nEBITDA $ 5,888 $ 7,306 $ 23,376 $ 22,563\nInterest income (386) (568) (799) (1,829)\nLoss from debt extinguishment — — 287 —\nLoss from financial derivative instrument — — 59 —\nGain from the sale of vessel, net — — (8,017) —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 5,502 $ 6,738 $ 14,906 $ 20,734\n21\nCONTACT\nPyxis Tankers Inc.\nK.

(Nasdaq Cap Mkts: PXS), (“we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company”\nor “Pyxis Tankers”), an international shipping company, today announced unaudited results for the three and nine-\nmonth periods ended September 30, 2024.\nSummary\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Revenues, net were $13.8 million an increase of $2.7 million, or\n24.3%, over the comparable quarter in 2023. For the same period, our time charter equivalent (“TCE”) revenues were\n$11.7 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 25.5%, over the comparable quarter in 2023. Our net income attributable\nto common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $3.6 million, an increase of $0.4 million\nover the comparable period in 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, the net income per common share was $0.34 basic\nand $0.31 diluted compared to the net income per common share of $0.29 basic and $0.26 diluted for the same period\nin 2023. Our Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $6.7 million, an increase of\n$1.2 million over the comparable period in 2023. Please see “Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions” below.\nOn July 30, 2024, we agreed with an existing lender to refinance the existing debt of one of our subsidiaries, the\nSeventhone Corp. The amended loan agreement provides a five year amortizing bank loan, due July 2029, with similar\nquarterly repayments, priced at SOFR plus 2.40% (from 3.35%) and is secured by, among other things, the vessel “Pyxis\nTheta”. In addition, the same lender agreed to reduce the interest margin from 3.15% to 2.40% applicable to our\nsubsidiary’s Eleventhone Corp. (“Pyxis Lamda”) credit facility which matures in December 2026. As of September 30,\n2024, the outstanding balance of these two separate loans aggregated $26.5 million, and the average reduction in\ninterest margin was 85 basis points.\nValentios Valentis, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n“We are pleased to report solid results for the third fiscal quarter of 2024 with revenues, net of $13.8 million and\nnet income attributable to common shareholders of $3.6 million with basic earnings per share of $0.34 basic and $0.31\ndiluted. In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the product tanker sector continued to experience a healthy\nchartering environment driven by global demand for transportation fuels, tight inventories of many petroleum\nproducts, supportive refinery activity, combined with the significant effects of the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the\nMiddle East which has led to continued market dislocation of shifting trade patterns and ton-mile expansion of\nseaborne cargo transportation. During the third quarter, we reported an average daily TCE for our MRs of $29,826.\nDespite the usual seasonal slowdown, the product tanker environment remains resilient, and as of\nNovember 20, 2024, 69% of our MR available days in the quarter ending December 31, 2024, were booked at an\naverage estimated TCE of $24,630 per day. We own and operate three modern eco-efficient MRs, one of which are\ncurrently employed under short-term time charters and two on spot voyage. On the dry bulk side, chartering\nconditions have recently been lackluster. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our three mid-sized eco-efficient\nbulk carriers generated an average TCE of $13,841 per day. All of our dry bulk vessels are currently employed under\nshort-term time charters, and as of November 20, 2024, the average estimated TCE was $13,190/d with bookings of\n55% of available days in the 2024 fourth quarter.\nWe are guardedly optimistic about the chartering environment for product tankers and dry bulk carriers for the near-\nterm. Modest global demand growth for seaborne cargoes across a broad range of refined petroleum products and\ndry-bulk commodities is expected to continue with the respective orderbooks remaining relatively manageable.\nLonger-term supply/demand fundamentals remain constructive, especially given the fleet age profiles of both sectors.\nEven though inflation is decelerating with the possibility of further interest rate cuts and continued moderate global\neconomic growth, the uncertainty surrounding macro-economic conditions and unfolding global events necessitate\ncontinued prudent risk management. Beyond the expected uptick in demand for the winter season, the tanker sector\nmay benefit from the prospect of greater restrictions against certain sanctioned countries which may help offset the\neffects of the possible de-escalation of armed conflicts. However, the potential expansion of tariffs amongst major\ntrading partners is likely to lead to further market dislocation and volatility.\nVessel values are still near historical highs but have started to moderate. We will continue to scrutinize the second-\nhand market for compelling vessel acquisitions, primarily in the product tanker sector. In the meantime, we expect to\ncontinue to pursue the repurchase of additional common shares under our authorized program, while repaying\nscheduled bank debt as well as maintaining operational and capital discipline. Since June, 2023, and as of November\n20, 2024 we have repurchased of 581K common shares in the open market and redeemed all the outstanding Series\nA Convertible Preferred Stock, which eliminated potential dilution of 1.8 million common shares, or in aggregate\n2.38 million shares on a fully diluted basis, further enhancing shareholder value. “\nResults for the Three Months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024\nAmounts relating to variations in period–on–period comparisons shown in this section are derived from the interim\nconsolidated financials presented below (Amounts are presented in million U.S. dollars, rounded to the nearest one\nhundred thousand, except as otherwise noted).\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported Revenues, net of $13.8 million, or 24.3% higher than\n$11.1 million in the comparable 2023 period. Our net income attributable to common shareholders was $3.6 million,\nor $0.34 basic and $0.31 diluted net income per common share, compared to a net income attributable to common\nshareholders of $3.1 million, or $0.29 basic and $0.26 diluted net income per common share, for the same period in\n2023. The weighted average number of basic common shares decreased by 0.17 million to 10.57 million in the most\nrecent period versus the third quarter of 2023. The weighted average number of diluted common shares also\ndecreased in 2024 to 11.9 million shares, which assumes the full conversion of all the outstanding Series A Convertible\nPreferred Stock in the most recent period. The average MR daily TCE rate during the third quarter of 2024 was $29,826\nor 6.4% higher than the $28,024 MR daily TCE rate for the same period in 2023, due to better market conditions. The\nnew dry-bulkers, the Ultramax carrier (which was acquired in September of 2023) and the two Kamsarmaxes (which\nwere acquired in February and June of 2024), had an average TCE rate of $13,841 for the third quarter of 2024. The\nrevenue mix of the MR tankers for the third quarter of 2024 was 59% from short-term time charters and 41% from\nspot market employment, while the dry-bulk carriers were hired for short-term time charters. Adjusted EBITDA\nincreased by $1.2 million to $6.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $5.5 million for the same period in 2023\nprimarily due to 167 more ownership days for our fleet, from 385 days in the third quarter of 2023 compared to 552\nin the third quarter of 2024, and higher average TCE rates for our MRs.\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nTanker fleet September 30, September 30,\n(Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for daily TCE rates) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nMR Revenues, net 1 $ 11,098 9,593 32,219 29,417\nMR Voyage related costs and commissions 1 (1,654) (1,480) (4,910) (3,972)\nMR Time charter equivalent revenues 1, 3 $ 9,444 8,113 27,309 25,445\nMR Total operating days 1 337 272 1,075 808\nMR Daily Time Charter Equivalent rate 1, 3 $/d 28,024 29,826 25,404 31,492\nAverage number of MR vessels 1 4.0 3.0 4.3 3.0\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nDry-bulk fleet September 30, September 30,\n(Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for daily TCE rates) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nDry-bulk Revenues, net 2 $ n/a 4,199 n/a 10,090\nDry-bulk Voyage related costs and commissions 2 n/a (642) n/a (1,465)\nDry-bulk charter equivalent revenues 2, 3 $ n/a 3,557 n/a 8,625\nDry-bulk Total operating days 2 n/a 257 n/a 509\nDry-bulk Daily Time Charter Equivalent rate 2,3 $/d n/a 13,841 n/a 16,946\nAverage number of Dry-bulk vessels 2 n/a 3.0 n/a 2.2\n2\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nTotal fleet September 30, September 30,\n(Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for daily TCE rates) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nRevenues, net 1, 2 $ 11,098 13,792 32,219 39,507\nVoyage related costs and commissions 1, 2 (1,654) (2,121) (4,910) (5,436)\nCharter equivalent revenues 1, 2, 3 $ 9,444 11,671 27,309 34,071\nTotal operating days 1, 2 337 529 1,075 1,317\nDaily Time Charter Equivalent rate 1, 2, 3 $/d 28,024 22,060 25,404 25,870\nAverage number of vessels 1,2 4.0 6.0 4.3 5.2\n1 a) The eco-efficient MR “Pyxis Epsilon” was sold to an unaffiliated buyer on December 15, 2023.\nb) Our non-core small tankers, “Northsea Alpha” and “Northsea Beta”, which were sold on January 28, 2022 and March 1, 2022, respectively, have been excluded\nin the above table.

Thus, “Voyage related costs and commissions” of $141 thousand related to the drybulk vessel are not included in the above table.\n3 Subject to rounding; please see “Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions” below.\nManagement’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Results for the Three Months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024\nAmounts relating to variations in period–on–period comparisons shown in this section are derived from the interim consolidated\nfinancials presented below (Amounts are presented in million U.S. dollars, rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except\nas otherwise noted).\nRevenues, net: Revenues, net of $13.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, represented an\nincrease of $2.7 million, or 24.3%, from $11.1 million in the comparable period of 2023. In the third quarter of 2024,\nour average daily TCE rate for our MR fleet was $29,826, a $1,802 per day increase from $28,024 for the same period\nin 2023, and for our recently acquired dry-bulk fleet was $13,841 per day. Solid market conditions continued as our\nMRs generated utilization of 98.6% as compared to 98.5% in the same quarter of 2023. Our dry-bulk carriers for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 achieved 93.1% utilization. Total fleet ownership days in the third quarter of\n2024 were 552 on an average of 6.0 vessels compared with 385 days on an average of 4.0 vessels for the same period\nof 2023. This increase was due to the sale of the “Pyxis Epsilon” in December 2023 which was more than offset by the\nacquisitions of the dry-bulk carriers “Konkar Ormi”, “Konkar Asteri” and “Konkar Venture” in September 2023,\nFebruary 2024 and June 2024, respectively.\nVoyage related costs and commissions: Voyage related costs and commissions of $2.1 million in the third quarter of\n2024, represented an increase of $0.3 million, or 18.2%, from $1.8 million in the same period of 2023. Spot\nemployment days for our vessels, including idle days, were 114 days in the third quarter in 2024, 18 days lower\ncompared to 132 days in the same period of 2023, which was partially offset by the higher bunkers consumed in the\nthird quarter of 2024. Under spot charters, all voyage expenses are typically borne by us rather than the charterer and\na decrease in spot employment results in decreased voyage related costs and commissions.\nVessel operating expenses: Vessel operating expenses of $3.8 million for the three-month period ended September\n30, 2024, represented an increase of $1.1 million, or 39.9% compared to same period in 2023, which reflected 167\nmore vessel ownership days and inflationary cost pressures.\n3\nGeneral and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses of $0.7 million for the third quarter of\n2024 decreased by 13.9% compared to $0.8 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was attributable to lower\nprofessional fees.\nManagement fees: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, management fees charged by our tanker ship\nmanager, Pyxis Maritime Corp. (“Maritime”), our dry-bulk ship manager Konkar Shipping Agencies S.A. (“Konkar\nAgencies”), both affiliated entities of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Valentis, and from International\nTanker Management Ltd. (“ITM”), the technical manager of our MRs, increased by $0.1 million, reflecting 167 more\nvessel ownership days compared to the same period in 2023.\nAmortization of special survey costs: Amortization of special survey costs of $0.1 million for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, remained flat compared to the same period of 2023.\nDepreciation: Depreciation of $1.9 million for the quarter that ended September 30, 2024, represented an increase of\n$0.6 million, or 44.6% compared to $1.3 million in 2023 and reflected additional depreciation for the newly acquired\nbulkers “Konkar Ormi”, “Konkar Asteri” and “Konkar Venture” partially offset by depreciation ceasing of the sold\ntanker “Pyxis Epsilon”.\nInterest and finance costs: Interest and finance costs for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $1.8 million\ncompared to $1.4 million in the comparable period in 2023, represented an increase of $0.4 million, or 31.0%. This\nincrease was attributed to higher average debt levels offset by lower SOFR referenced interest rates paid on all the\nfloating rate bank debt. On July 30, 2024, we agreed with an existing lender to refinance the Seventhone Corp. (“Pyxis\nTheta”) outstanding debt of $10.75 million. The amended agreement provides a five year amortizing bank loan with\nsimilar quarterly repayment with a maturity of July 2029 and reduce pricing to SOFR plus 2.40% (from SOFR plus\n3.35%). In addition, the same bank agreed to reduce the interest rate margin from 3.15% to 2.40% on the outstanding\n$16.5 million loan to the Eleventhone Corp. (“Pyxis Lamda”).\nInterest income: Interest income of $0.6 million was received during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from the\nCompany’s short term time deposits compared to $0.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of $0.2 million,\nor 47.2%, due to higher cash balances.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results for the Nine Months ended September 30, 2023 and\n2024\nAmounts relating to variations in period–on–period comparisons shown in this section are derived from the interim consolidated\nfinancials presented below (Amounts are presented in million U.S. dollars, rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except\nas otherwise noted).\nRevenues, net: Revenues, net of $39.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represented an increase\nof $7.3 million, or 22.6%, from $32.2 million in the comparable period of 2023. In the nine-month period of 2024, our\nMR daily TCE rate for our three MRs was $31,492, a $6,088 per day increase from the 2023 period as a result of higher\ndemurrage income due to greater spot chartering activity and better market conditions. Revenues, net also enhanced\ndue to the dry vessel additions which contributed 509 operating days. For the 2024 period, our dry-bulk daily TCE rate\nwas $16,946.\nVoyage related costs and commissions: Voyage related costs and commissions of $5.4 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, increased $0.4 million from $5.1 million in the same period of 2023. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, our MRs were on spot charters or unfixed for 364 days in total, compared to 302 days in\n2023. This higher spot chartering activity for our MRs contribute higher voyage costs which are typically borne by us\nrather than the charterer, thus an increase in spot employment results in increased voyage related costs and\ncommissions. In the first nine-months of 2024 these higher expenses were offset by lower bunker fuel costs.\nVessel operating expenses: Vessel operating expenses of $9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrepresented a $1.4 million or 16.5% increase compared to $8.5 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was\n4\nmainly attributed to the 227-day increase in ownership days from 1,191 for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 to 1,418 for the 2024 period.\nGeneral and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses of $2.2 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, represented a decrease of $0.6 million or 20.2%, from $2.8 million in the comparable period in\n2023, mainly due to the performance bonus of $0.6 million that paid in the first quarter of 2023 to Maritime, partially\noffset by increased administrative fees due to Maritime and Konkar Agencies which were adjusted by 3.5% to reflect\nthe 2024 inflation rate in Greece.\nManagement fees: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management fees increased $0.2 million with the\ncomparable period of 2023. Management fees represent the charges by Maritime, Konkar Agencies and ITM.\nAmortization of special survey costs: Amortization of special survey costs of $0.3 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, remained stable compared to the same period in 2023.\nDepreciation: Depreciation of $5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $1.0 million\nor 26.6% compared to $4.0 million in the comparable period of 2023. The increase was attributed to the additions of\nnewly acquired dry-bulk vessels partially counterbalanced by the ceasing of depreciation from the sales of tankers\n“Pyxis Malou” during the first quarter of 2023 and “Pyxis Epsilon” in late 2023.\nGain from the sale of vessels, net: During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a gain from the\nsale of the “Pyxis Malou” of $8.0 million, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023.\nLoss from debt extinguishment: During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a loss from debt\nextinguishment of $0.3 million reflecting the write-off of the remaining unamortized balance of deferred financing\ncosts, which were associated with the first quarter loan repayments from the sale of the “Pyxis Malou” and debt\nrefinancing of the “Pyxis Karteria”.\nInterest and finance costs: Interest and finance costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were\n$4.9 million, compared to $4.2 million in the comparable period in 2023, an increase of $0.7 million, or 16.6%. Despite\nlower LIBOR/SOFR indexed rates paid on all the floating rate bank debt, this increase was primarily attributable to\nhigher average debt levels. On February 15, 2024, we completed the bank financing of the newly acquired dry-bulk\ncarrier, “Konkar Asteri” with a five year secured loan of $14.5 million. On June 27, 2024, the Company completed the\ndebt financing of the newly acquired dry-bulk carrier “Konkar Venture” with a $16.5 million five year secured loan from\nan existing lender. On July 30,2024, we agreed with an existing lender to amend the Seventhone Corp. (“Pyxis Theta”)\noutstanding debt of $10.75 million to a maturity of July 2029 and reduce pricing to SOFR plus 2.40%. In addition, the\nsame bank agreed to reduce the interest margin from 3.15% to 2.40% on the outstanding $16.5 million loan to the\nEleventhone Corp. (“Pyxis Lamda”).\nInterest income: Interest income of $1.8 million was received during the nine-month period ended September 30,\n2024 from the Company’s short term time deposits increased by $1.0 million or 128.9% compared to $0.8 million for\nthe same period in 2023. The increase was a result of higher available cash balances invested in time deposits during\nthe most recent period.\n5\nInterim Consolidated Statements of Income\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share and per share data)\nThree months ended September 30,\n2023 2024\nRevenues, net $ 11,098 $ 13,792\nExpenses:\nVoyage related costs and commissions (1,795) (2,121)\nVessel operating expenses (2,692) (3,765)\nGeneral and administrative expenses (806) (695)\nManagement fees, related parties (136) (340)\nManagement fees, other (189) (133)\nAmortization of special survey costs (98) (98)\nDepreciation (1,317) (1,905)\nAllowance for credit losses 22 —\nOperating income 4,087 4,735\nOther expenses:\nInterest and finance costs (1,393) (1,825)\nInterest income 386 568\nTotal other expenses, net (1,007) (1,257)\nNet income $ 3,080 $ 3,478\nLoss assumed by non-controlling interests 261 234\nNet income attributable to Pyxis Tankers Inc. $ 3,341 $ 3,712\nDividend Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (195) (147)\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,146 $ 3,565\nIncome per common share, basic $ 0.29 $ 0.34\nIncome per common share, diluted $ 0.26 $ 0.31\nWeighted average number of common shares, basic 10,739,700 10,572,027\nWeighted average number of common shares, diluted 12,562,685 11,927,523\n6\nInterim Consolidated Statements of Income\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share and per share data)\nNine months ended September 30,\n2023 2024\nRevenues, net $ 32,219 $ 39,507\nExpenses:\nVoyage related costs and commissions (5,068) (5,436)\nVessel operating expenses (8,482) (9,881)\nGeneral and administrative expenses (2,808) (2,241)\nManagement fees, related parties (466) (838)\nManagement fees, other (586) (377)\nAmortization of special survey costs (274) (292)\nDepreciation (3,951) (5,000)\nAllowance for credit losses 97 —\nGain from the sale of vessels, net 8,017 —\nOperating income 18,698 15,442\nOther expenses, net:\nLoss from debt extinguishment (287) —\nLoss from financial derivative instruments (59) —\nInterest and finance costs (4,201) (4,898)\nInterest income 799 1,829\nTotal other expenses, net (3,748) (3,069)\nNet income $ 14,950 $ 12,373\nLoss assumed by non-controlling interests 261 181\nNet income attributable to Pyxis Tankers Inc. $ 15,211 $ 12,554\nDividend Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (613) (530)\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 14,598 $ 12,024\nIncome per common share, basic $ 1.35 $ 1.14\nIncome per common share, diluted $ 1.21 $ 1.06\nWeighted average number of common shares, basic 10,749,449 10,510,874\nWeighted average number of common shares, diluted 12,551,528 11,866,370\n7\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nAs of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share and per share data)\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2023 2024\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 34,539 $ 25,365\nShort-term investment in time deposits 20,000 17,000\nInventories 957 1,020\nTrade accounts receivable, net 4,964 9,332\nDue from related parties 194 —\nPrepayments and other current assets 226 621\nTotal current assets 60,880 53,338\nFIXED ASSETS, NET:\nVessels, net 99,273 141,929\nAdvance for vessel acquisition 2,663 —\nTotal fixed assets, net 101,936 141,929\nOTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS:\nRestricted cash 1,800 1,350\nDeferred dry-dock and special survey costs, net 1,622 1,334\nPrepayments and other non-current assets 75 25\nTotal other non-current assets 3,497 2,709\nTotal assets $ 166,313 $ 197,976\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nCurrent portion of long-term debt, net of deferred financing costs $ 5,580 $ 7,555\nTrade accounts payable 1,695 1,531\nDue to related parties 990 1,120\nHire collected in advance 1,173 —\nAccrued and other liabilities 646 1,124\nTotal current liabilities 10,084 11,330\nNON-CURRENT LIABILITIES:\nLong-term debt, net of current portion and deferred financing costs 55,370 78,855\nTotal non-current liabilities 55,370 78,855\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES — —\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:\nPreferred stock ($0.001 par value;

The amended agreement provides a five year amortizing bank loan with similar quarterly repayment\nwith a maturity of July 2029 and reduced pricing to SOFR plus 2.40% (from 3.35%). In addition, the same bank agreed\nto reduce the interest rate margin from 3.15% to 2.40% on the outstanding $16.5 million loan to the Eleventhone Corp.\n(“Pyxis Lamda”).\nOn August 5, 2024, we issued 267,857 restricted common shares to entities affiliated with our Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer, Mr. Valentis as part of the consideration paid in connection with the joint venture acquisition of the\n“Konkar Venture”.\nOn September 30, 2024, our weighted average interest rate on our total funded debt for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was 7.77% and on the same date the weighted average interest margin was 2.38%.

After these additional open market purchases, as of November 20, 2024,\nwe had 10,563,234 common shares outstanding of which 56.8% was beneficially owned by Mr. Valentis.\nNon-GAAP Measures and Definitions\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) represent the sum of net income, interest\nand finance costs, depreciation and amortization and, if any, income taxes during a period. Adjusted EBITDA represents\nEBITDA before certain non-operating charges, such as interest income, loss from debt extinguishment, loss from\nfinancial derivative instrument and gain from sales of vessels. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized\nmeasurements under U.S. GAAP.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented in this press release as we believe that they provide investors with means\nof evaluating and understanding how our management evaluates operating performance. These non-GAAP measures\nhave limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to\nfinancial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect:\n our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and\n cash requirements necessary to service interest and principal payments on our funded debt.\nIn addition, these non-GAAP measures do not have standardized meanings and are therefore unlikely to be\ncomparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

We utilize daily TCE because we believe it is a meaningful measure to compare period-to-period changes\nin our performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters and bareboat\n11\ncharters) under which our vessels may be employed between the periods. Our management also utilizes daily TCE to\nassist them in making decisions regarding the employment of the vessels. TCE Revenues are calculated by presenting\nRevenues, net after deducting Voyage related costs and commissions. We calculate daily TCE by dividing TCE Revenues,\nby operating days for the relevant period. Voyage related costs and commissions primarily consist of brokerage\ncommissions, port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by the\ncharterer under a time charter contract. TCE Revenues and daily TCE are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nVessel operating expenses (“Opex”) per day are our vessel operating expenses for a vessel, which primarily consist of\ncrew wages and related costs, insurance, lube oils, communications, spares and consumables, tonnage taxes as well\nas repairs and maintenance, divided by the ownership days in the applicable period.\nWe calculate utilization (“Utilization”) by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of\navailable days during the same period. We use fleet utilization to measure our efficiency in finding suitable\nemployment for our vessels and minimize the number of days that our vessels are off-hire for reasons other than\nscheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys and intermediate dry-dockings or vessel\npositioning. Ownership days are the total number of days in a period during which we owned each of the vessels in\nour fleet. Available days are the number of ownership days in a period, less the aggregate number of days that our\nvessels were off-hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys and\nintermediate dry-dockings and the aggregate number of days that we spent positioning our vessels during the\nrespective period for such repairs, upgrades and surveys. Operating days are the number of available days in a period,\nless the aggregate number of days that our vessels were off-hire or out of service due to any reason, including technical\nbreakdowns and unforeseen circumstances.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Opex, Utilization and daily TCE are not recognized measures under U.S. GAAP and should\nnot be regarded as substitutes for Revenues, net and Net income. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Opex\nand daily TCE does not imply, and should not be construed as an inference, that our future results will be unaffected\nby unusual or non-recurring items and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of\nperformance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nRecent Daily Fleet Data:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\n(Amounts in U.S. dollars per day)\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\nEco-Efficient MR2:\n(2024: 3 vessels) Daily TCE : 28,024 29,826 25,941 31,492\n(2023: 4 vessels) Opex per day: 6,513 7,228 6,805 7,193\nUtilization % : 98.5% 98.6% 96.3% 98.3%\nEco-Modified MR2:\n(2024: n/a) Daily TCE : n/a n/a 17,058 n/a\n(2023: 1 vessel) Opex per day: n/a n/a 9,327 n/a\nUtilization % : n/a n/a 79.3% n/a\nMR Fleet:\n(2024: 3 vessels) * Daily TCE : 28,024 29,826 25,404 31,492\n(2023: 5 vessels) * Opex per day: 6,533 7,228 6,981 7,193\nUtilization % : 98.5% 98.6% 95.0% 98.3%\nAverage number of MR vessels * 4.0 3.0 4.3 3.0\nDry-bulk:\n(2024: 3 vessels) * Daily TCE : n/a 13,841 n/a 16,946\n(2023: n/a) Opex per day: n/a 6,417 n/a 6,617\nUtilization % : n/a 93.1% n/a 85.3%\nAverage number of Dry-bulk vessels * n/a 3.0 n/a 2.2\n12\nThree months ended Nine months ended\n(Amounts in U.S. dollars per day)\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\nTotal Fleet:\n(2024: 6 vessels) * Daily TCE : 28,024 22,060 25,404 25,870\n(2023: 5 vessels) * Opex per day: 6,533 6,824 6,981 6,951\nUtilization % : 98.5% 95.8% 95.0% 92.8%\nAverage number of vessels * 4.0 6.0 4.3 5.2\nAs of November 20, 2024, our fleet consisted of three eco-efficient MR2 tankers, “Pyxis Lamda”, “Pyxis Theta”,\n“Pyxis Karteria”, and three dry-bulk vessels, “Konkar Ormi” delivered to our joint venture on September 14, 2023,\n“Konkar Asteri” delivered on February 15, 2024 and “Konkar Venture” delivered to our joint venture on June 28, 2024.\nDuring 2023 and 2024, the vessels in our fleet were employed under time and spot charters.\n*\na) The Eco-Modified MR “Pyxis Epsilon” was sold to an unaffiliated buyer on December 15, 2023.\nb) The dry-bulker “Konkar Ormi” was delivered on September 14, 2023 and commenced her initial charter on October 5, 2023.\nc) The dry-bulker “Konkar Asteri” was delivered on February 15, 2024 and commenced her initial charter on February 29, 2024.\nd) The dry-bulker “Konkar Venture” was delivered on June 28, 2024 and continued her employment under the existing time charter through mid-August.\nConference Call and Webcast\nToday, Friday, November 22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, the Company’s management will host a conference call\nto discuss the results.\nParticipants should dial into the call 10 minutes before the scheduled time using the following numbers: +1 877 405\n1226 (US Toll-Free Dial In) or +1 201 689 7823 (US and Standard International Dial In).
