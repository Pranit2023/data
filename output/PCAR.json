Third quarter revenues were $8.24 billion, compared to $8.70 billion reported in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nPACCAR reported net income of $3.29 billion ($6.25 per diluted share) for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $3.18 billion ($6.07 per diluted share) earned in same period last year, which included a $446.4 million after-tax, non-recurring charge related to civil litigation in Europe. Excluding the non-recurring charge, the company earned adjusted net income (non-GAAP) 1 of $3.63 billion ($6.92 per diluted share) in the first nine months of 2023.

The less-than-truckload segment is also performing well, while the truckload segment remains soft.” U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck industry retail sales in 2024 are estimated to be in a range of 250,000-270,000 vehicles. Class 8 truck industry retail sales for 2025 are expected to be in a range of 250,000-280,000 vehicles. \n\nEuropean truck industry registrations in the above 16-tonne segment are estimated to be in the range of 290,000-310,000 units this year. The market in 2025 is expected to be in a range of 270,000-300,000 trucks. Harald Seidel, DAF president, said, “DAF trucks’ aerodynamic, fuel-efficient vehicles and unparalleled driver comfort improves customers’ operational performance.” \n\nThe South American above 16-tonne truck market is projected to be in a range of 110,000-120,000 units this year, and in a similar range in 2025. Mike Kuester, PACCAR assistant vice president of South America, noted, “South American customers operate in challenging environments and appreciate the industry-leading durability and reliability of Kenworth and DAF premium heavy-duty trucks.” \n\n**DAF Showcases New Model Year 2025 Truck Range at IAA Hannover Truck Show**\n\nDAF exhibited its updated truck range at the IAA Transportation truck show last month in Hannover, Germany. The IAA show attracted a record 144,000 visitors in 7 days. DAF launched its new model year 2025 product range with a 3% improved fuel efficiency as well as enhanced safety and driver comfort. The new DAF product range was well received by the international trade press, DAF customers and DAF dealers. \n\n**Peterbilt Launches UltraLow Roof Vehicles for Car Carrier Applications**\n\nPeterbilt began production of two new vehicle configurations for the car carrier market, the Model 567 UltraLow Roof Day Cab and the Model 589 UltraLow Roof 58-inch Sleeper. These new vehicle configurations were developed in collaboration with leading car carriers and set new benchmarks in low-profile design, lightweight solutions, safety features, visibility and driver comfort. \n\nThe PACCAR MX-11 and MX-13 engines, coupled with the PACCAR TX-12 transmission, provide advanced power and performance for car carrier applications. \n\n**PACCAR Parts Achieves Strong Revenues and Pretax Profits**\n\nPACCAR Parts achieved pretax profit of $406.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $412.3 million earned in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 revenues were $1.66 billion, an increase of five percent, compared to $1.58 billion achieved in the third quarter last year. PACCAR Parts achieved pretax profit of $1.28 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $1.27 billion reported in the first nine months of 2023. PACCAR Parts’ nine-month revenues were $5.00 billion, four percent higher than the $4.80 billion achieved in the same period last year. “Third quarter parts sales and profits benefited from industry-leading logistics operations in PACCAR’s 19 strategically located Parts Distribution Centers (PDCs),” noted Laura Bloch, PACCAR vice president and PACCAR Parts general manager. “PACCAR Parts’ technology solutions such as Managed Dealer Inventory and innovative programs such as Fleet Services increase customers’ vehicle uptime and financial performance.” \n\nPACCAR will open its new 240,000 square-foot PDC in Massbach, Germany, in November. This PDC will expedite parts delivery to dealers and customers in the region. \n\nPACCAR’s 19 PDCs support more than 2,000 DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt dealer sales, parts and service locations, and over 300 TRP stores. These independent, well-capitalized dealers provide excellent service to customers, complementing the premium quality of DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles. \n\n**Financial Services Companies Achieve Good Results**\n\nPACCAR Financial Services (PFS) earned pretax income of $106.5 million in the third quarter this year compared to $133.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. PFS achieved third quarter 2024 revenues of $536.1 million compared to $464.1 million in the same period last year. For the first nine months of 2024, PFS earned pretax income of $331.6 million compared to $427.3 million last year. Nine-month revenues were $1.56 billion compared with $1.33 billion for the same period a year ago. Todd Hubbard, PACCAR vice president, said, “PFS achieved good third quarter results due to its high quality portfolio. The used truck market has normalized in North America, but remains soft in Europe, which is reflected in PFS’ quarterly results this year. PFS is a leader in the market with its superior Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF products, innovative technologies that provide seamless credit application and loan servicing processes, and its support of customers in all phases of the business cycle.” \n\nPFS has a portfolio of 232,000 trucks and trailers, with total assets of $22.48 billion. PacLease, a major full-service truck leasing company with a fleet of 41,000 vehicles, is included in this segment. Craig Gryniewicz, PACCAR Financial Corp. president said, “PACCAR’s strong balance sheet, complemented by its A+/A1 credit ratings, enables PFS to have excellent access to the commercial paper and medium-term note markets. PFS profitably supports the sale of PACCAR trucks in 26 countries on four continents.” \n\n**Capital Investment and Research and Development**\n\nPACCAR’s excellent long-term profits, strong balance sheet and consistent focus on quality have enabled the company to invest $8.4 billion in new and expanded facilities, innovative products and new technologies during the past decade. Capital investments are estimated to be in a range of $760-$800 million, and research and development expenses to be in a range of $450-$470 million, this year. PACCAR estimates that it will invest $700-$800 million in capital projects and $480-$530 million in research and development expenses in 2025. “PACCAR is investing in additional global engine manufacturing capacity, and in the construction of a new engine remanufacturing facility that will be located in Columbus, Mississippi. Truck factory investments include the expansion at Kenworth Chillicothe, Ohio, PACCAR Mexico, and the DAF electric truck assembly plant in Eindhoven, Netherlands,” said Harrie Schippers, PACCAR president and chief financial officer. “In addition to the capital and R&D investments, the company expects to invest $600-$900 million in its battery joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies, over the next three years.” \n\nPACCAR is a global technology leader in the design, manufacture and customer support of high-quality light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks under the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates. PACCAR also designs and manufactures advanced powertrains, provides financial services and information technology, and distributes truck parts related to its principal business. PACCAR’s premium trucks and transportation solutions drive the world to a better future. \n\nPACCAR will hold a conference call with securities analysts to discuss third quarter earnings on October 22, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific time.

\n**PACCAR Inc**  \n---  \n**SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION**  \n**RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**  \nThis earnings release includes “adjusted net income (non-GAAP)” and “adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP)”, which are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), since they exclude a charge for EC-related claims. These measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  \nAdjustment for the EC-related claims relates to a pre-tax charge of $600.0 million ($446.4 million after-tax) for estimable total costs recorded in Interest and other (income) expenses, net in the first quarter 2023.  \nManagement utilizes these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding a significant non-recurring charge that is not representative of underlying operating trends.  \nReconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) are as follows:  \nNine Months Ended   \n_($ in millions, except per share amounts)_ |  September 30, 2023   \nNet income | $ |  3,183.5   \nEC-related claims, net of taxes |  446.4   \nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) | $ |  3,629.9   \nPer diluted share:  \nNet income | $ |  6.07   \nEC-related claims, net of taxes |  .85   \nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) | $ |  6.92   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241022154137r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nKen Hastings (425) 468-7530 ken.hastings@paccar.com\n\nSource: PACCAR Inc\n\n[View All News](https://investors.paccar.com/financial-news/default.aspx)\n"

income (non-GAAP)” and “adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP)”, which are financial measures that are not in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), since they exclude a charge for EC-related claims. These measures differ from the most directly comparable measures\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nAdjustment for the EC-related claims relates to a pre-tax charge of $600.0 million ($446.4 million after-tax) for estimable total costs recorded in Interest and other expenses (income),\nnet in the first quarter 2023.\nManagement utilizes these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends\nby excluding a significant non-recurring charge that is not representative of underlying operating trends.\nReconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) are as follows:\n($ in million, except per share amounts) Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nNet income $3,183.5\nEC-related claims, net of tax 446.4\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) $3,629.9\nPer diluted share:\nNet income $6.07\nEC-related claims, net of tax .85\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) $6.92\nOctober 2024\nPage 68\nOctober 2024\nPage 69"

PFS profitably supports the sale of PACCAR\ntrucks in 26 countries on four continents.”\nCapital Investment and Research and Development\nPACCAR’s excellent long-term profits, strong balance sheet and consistent focus on quality have\nenabled the company to invest $8.4 billion in new and expanded facilities, innovative products and\nnew technologies during the past decade.

These measures differ\nfrom the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable\nto similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nAdjustment for the EC-related claims relates to a pre-tax charge of $600.0 million ($446.4 million after-tax) for\nestimable total costs recorded in Interest and other (income) expenses, net in the first quarter 2023.\nManagement utilizes these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s performance and believes these\nmeasures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding a significant non-\nrecurring charge that is not representative of underlying operating trends.\nReconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and\nadjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) are as follows:\nNine Months Ended\n($ in millions, except per share amounts) September 30, 2023\nNet income $ 3 ,183.5\nEC-related claims, net of taxes 446.4\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 3 ,629.9\nPer diluted share:\nNet income $ 6.07\nEC-related claims, net of taxes .85\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 6.92"

diluted share (non-GAAP)”, which are financial measures that are not in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), since they exclude a charge for EC-related claims. These measures differ from the most directly comparable measures\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nAdjustment for the EC-related claims relates to a pre-tax charge of $600.0 million ($446.4 million after-tax) for estimable total costs recorded in Interest and other expenses (income),\nnet in the first quarter 2023.\nManagement utilizes these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends\nby excluding a significant non-recurring charge that is not representative of underlying operating trends.\nReconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) are as follows:\n($ in million, except per share amounts) Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nNet income $3,183.5\nEC-related claims, net of tax 446.4\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) $3,629.9\nPer diluted share:\nNet income $6.07\nEC-related claims, net of tax .85\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) $6.92\nOctober 2024\nPage 68\nOctober 2024\nPage 69"
