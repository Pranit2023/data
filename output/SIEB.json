Our journey has been defined by a steadfast\nCEO (cid:31) CHAIRMAN\ncommitment to growth, innovation, and value creation for our\nshareholders, clients, and strategic partners.\nOF THE BOARD\nFinancial Performance\nThe transformation of Siebert under our leadership has been nothing\nshort of extraordinary. When we acquired the company in 2016, annual\nrevenue stood at $10 million with an operating loss of $6 million. By\n2023, we had dramatically improved our financial position, achieving\nannual revenue of $72 million and an operating income of $18 million.\nDuring this period, our total equity grew significantly from $2 million to\n$71 million, demonstrating our ability to build lasting value. In 2023, we\nengaged in several initiatives that led to significant growth in our retail\ncustomer accounts, the drivers of which were related to a partnership\nwith NFS as well as new retail accounts from corporate services.\n$83\n$70\n$60\n$50\n$40\n$30\n$20\n$10\n$\nS(10)\nsnoilliM\nRevenue Operating Income\nOur journey has\nbeen defined by\na steadfast\ncommitment to\ngrowth, innovation,\nand value creation\n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\n6\nLETTER FROM THE CEO AND\nCHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD\nOur momentum continues in 2024, with record results for the first half of\nthe year and impressive growth across key metrics. In the first half of the\nyear, we achieved revenue of $41.3 million, marking a 22%\nyear-over-year increase. Operating income for the same period rose by\n19% to $10.7 million. We're particularly proud of the 31% increase in net\nincome available to common stockholders. Coupled with a 12% rise in\ntotal equity from the previous year, these results underscore our strong\ncapital position and ability to capitalize on future growth opportunities.\n$18\n$16\n$14\n$12\n$10\n$8\n$6\n$4\n$2\n$\nStrategic Acquisitions and Developments\nOur growth strategy has bee n bolstered by key acquisitions and strategic\ninitiatives. In 2019, we acquired StockCross Financial Services, Inc., a\nself-clearing broker-dealer that significantly enhanced our capabilities in\nmarket making, corporate services, IRA custodianship, and stock loan\noperations. We have since expanded our Stock Loan and Market Making\ngroups, further strengthening our position in the financial markets.\nMore recently, in August 2024, we acquired Gebbia Entertainment, LLC,\nmarking our entry into the media and entertainment industries. This move\nopens new avenues for content production and provides excellent\nmarketing and branding opportunities for Siebert.\nWe have also focused on expanding our physical presence, opening new\noffice locations in Miami Beach and New York City. These expansions\nreaffirm our commitment to serving our customers with greater efficiency\nand effectiveness.\nOn the technology front, we recently launch a redesign of our website\nand branding efforts, and are in the process of developing new\ntechnologies for our retail and corporate clients. These initiatives reflect\nour desire to honor those who protect, serve, and support our country.\nAltogether these investments reflect our recognition of the importance of\nproviding top-tier offerings and value to our clients.\nWe've also made strategic moves to strengthen our leadership and\nadvisory capabilities.

          "content": "Muriel Siebert & Co., LLC & Siebert Advisor NXT, LLC\nMuriel Siebert & Co., LLC (“MSCO”) is a broker-dealer and its affiliate Siebert AdvisorNXT, LLC (“AdvisorNXT”) is\nan investment adviser. Both are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). MSCO is also a\nmember of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the\nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).\n• Brokerage and investment advisory services and fees differ, and it is important for you to understand these\ndifferences. Free and simple tools are available to research firms and financial professionals at Investor.gov/CRS,\nwhich also provides educational materials about broker-dealers, investment advisers, and investing.\nWhat investment services and advice can you provide me?\nWe offer both brokerage and investment advisory services.\nOur brokerage services include buying and selling securities at your direction and providing you with investment\nrecommendations, financial tools and planning services, and investor education from time to time or at your request. We\noffer mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), domestic and international equities, options, fixed income securities,\ncertificates of deposit (CDs) and structured notes, unit investment trusts, and variable annuities. Unless we separately\nagree in writing, we do not monitor your brokerage account and you make the ultimate decision regarding the purchase or\nsale of investments.\nOur advisory services include our asset allocation services using mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) and\nmanaged portfolios from in-house and third-party investment managers. Depending on which program you select, our\nasset allocation services are either “non-discretionary” or “discretionary”—meaning that either we will recommend\ninvestments to you and you will make the ultimate decision regarding the purchase or sale of investments (non-\ndiscretionary), or we will make the ultimate investment decisions without your signoff (discretionary). The third-party\nmanagers we make available to you will invest your account on a discretionary basis using mutual funds, ETFs, and\nother securities. All of our advisory services are offered through “wrap fee programs” (as described below) and either\nwe or the third-party manager will monitor your advisory account and investments as standard services. At AdvisorNXT\nthis service will be provided on a weekly basis. You must meet certain investment minimums to open an advisory account.\nCurrent account minimums may be accessed through your investment professional, or at www.siebert.com.\nFor Additional information regarding our broker dealer services please visit our website at www.siebert.com. For our\nadvisory services visit www.siebert.com and refer to our latest Brochure Form ADV Part 2-A, Items 4, 5 & 7.\nOur affiliate Park-Wilshire Insurance offers a variety of insurance products, including fixed and immediate annuities and life\ninsurance.\nConversation Starters. Ask your financial professional—\n• Given my financial situation, should I choose an investment advisory service? Should I choose a brokerage\nservice? Should I choose both types of services? Why or why not?\n• How will you choose investments to recommend to me?\n• What is your relevant experience, including your licenses, education and other qualifications? What do these\nqualifications mean?\nPage 1 of 4\nWhat fees will I pay?\nThe fees you pay depend on whether you choose brokerage services, advisory services, or both.\nFor brokerage services, the principal fees and costs are transaction-based fees for recommendations and execution of\nsecurities trades. Depending on the investment product you select, these fees can include up-front commissions, as well\nas fees that are charged on an on-going basis for as long as you hold the investment (“trails”). If we buy a security from\nyou or sell a security to you for our own account (as “principal”), we may mark the price up or down, which is a benefit to\nus. Because we are compensated for transactions, we have an incentive to encourage you to trade more frequently and in\ngreater amounts, and to trade with us as principal because we receive more revenue when you do so.\nYou will also pay fees for custodial or administrative services, as well as fees and expenses that are included in the expense\nratios of certain of your investments, including in mutual funds, ETFs, and variable annuities. For additional information\nabout the fees and costs for our brokerage services, please visit www.siebert.com.\nFor advisory services, the principal fees and costs are the “wrap” program fee for the program you select. These fees\nare “asset-based” meaning that the fee is calculated as a percentage of the assets invested in your advisory account\naccording to the fee schedule in your advisory agreement with us. This means that the more assets you invest in your\naccount, the more you will pay in fees, and therefore we have an incentive to encourage you to increase your advisory\naccount assets. For additional information about the fees and costs for our advisory services please refer to our\nSiebert AdvisorNXT, LLC brochure Form Part 2-A, Item 4.\nThe annual wrap advisory fee includes all brokerage commissions, transaction fees, and other related costs and expenses\nexcept those inherent in a particular investment vehicle. The annual investment advisory fee is prorated and charged\nquarterly, in advance, based upon the market value of the assets under management as of the last day of the previous\nquarter. AdvisorNXT may change the fee at any time by giving 30 days’ prior written notice.\nInvestment Advisory Fees for the initial period or the first quarter of service are calculated on a pro rata basis from the\ninception date of the account to the end of the first quarter. If assets are deposited into or withdrawn from an account\nafter the inception of a quarter, the fee payable with respect to such assets may be adjusted on a pro rata basis for\ndeposits and/or withdrawals occurring within such quarter and will be calculated in accordance with the advisory\nagreement based on the days remaining in the quarter.\nIn the AdvisorNXT Robo Management program, you may also pay miscellaneous fees that your account’s custodian may\ncharge, including wire fees, transfer fees, and other fees. For additional information, please see Siebert AdvisorNXT,\nLLC Brochure Form Part 2-A Item 4.\nYou will pay fees and costs whether you make or lose money on your investments. Fees and costs will reduce any\namount of money you make on your investments over time. Please make sure you understand what fees and costs\nyou are paying.\nConversation Starters. Ask your financial professional—\n• Help me understand how these fees and costs might affect my investments. If I give you $10,000 to\ninvest, how much will go to fees and costs, and how much will be invested for me?\n• What are your legal obligations to me when providing recommendations as my broker-dealer or\nwhen acting as my investment adviser? How else does your firm make money and what conflicts of\ninterest do you have?\nWhen we provide you with a recommendation as your broker-dealer or act as your investment adviser, we must act in your best\ninterest and not put our interest ahead of yours. At the same time, the way we make money creates some conflicts with\nyour interests. You should understand and ask us about these conflicts because they can affect the recommendations and\ninvestment advice we provide you. Here are some examples to help you understand what this means:\nPage 2 of 4\nExamples of Ways We Make Money and Conflicts of Interest.\n• Proprietary Products: We will earn higher fees, compensation, and other benefits when you invest in a\nproduct that we (or one of our affiliates) advise, manage, or sponsor, such as a mutual fund or structured\nCD.As such, we have an incentive to recommend (or to invest your assets in) those products over third-\nparty products.\n• Third-Party Payments: We receive payments from third party product sponsors and managers (or their\naffiliates) when we recommend or sell certain products. As such, we have an incentive to recommend (or\nto invest your assets in) products of third parties that pay us over products of third parties that do not pay\nus or pay us less.\n• Revenue Sharing: Certain managers and sponsors (or their affiliates) share the revenue they earn when\nyou invest in certain of their investment products (primarily mutual funds, unit investment trusts, cash\nsweep vehicles and variable annuities) with us. As such, we have an incentive to recommend (or to invest\nyour assets in) products of sponsors and managers that share their revenue with us, over other products of\nsponsors or managers that do not share their revenue, or who share less.\n• Principal Trading: We may buy or sell securities to you for our own account because we earn compensation\n(such as commission equivalents, mark-ups, mark-downs, and spreads).\nFor additional information, please refer to our Siebert AdvisorNXT, LLC Brochure Form ADV Part 2-A, Section 4 and 7.\nConversation Starter. Ask your financial professional—\n• How might your conflicts of interest affect me, and how will you address them?\n• How do your financial professionals make money?\nThe firm’s financial professionals are principally compensated based on a percentage of the revenues that are produced\nby the clients they service.\nIn Advisory Accounts Siebert financial professionals are compensated based on the amount of client assets they service. The fee\nrevenue generated is split between the firm and the financial professional based on a negotiated payout percentage.\nIn Brokerage Accounts the Firm’s financial professionals are compensated based on sales commissions, as well as fees that\nare charged on an on-going basis for as long as you hold the investment. Also, Siebert financial professionals may buy a\nsecurity from you or sell a security to you for our own account (as “principal”), and the price to you may be marked up or\ndown. Finally, Siebert may be compensated by issuers of some financial instruments for selling their products. The revenue\ngenerated from all these activities is split between the firm and the financial professional based on a negotiated percentage.\n• Do you or your financial professionals have legal or disciplinary history?\nYes. Visit Investor.gov/CRS or www.brokercheck.finra.org for a free and simple search tool to research us and our\nfinancial professionals. The Firm also provides a biography of your Investment Advisor Representative when opening an\nAdvisory account. This document includes any legal and disciplinary history.\nPage 3 of 4\nConversation Starter. Ask your financial professional—\n• As a financial professional, do you have any disciplinary history? For what type of conduct?\nConversation Starter. Ask your financial professional—\n• Who is my primary contact person? Is he or she a representative of an investment adviser or a\nbroker-dealer? Who can I talk to if I have concerns about how this person is treating me?\nFor assisted accounts, a dedicated financial representative or investment advisor representative will be assigned to you.\nShould your dedicated representative no longer be available or should you request another representative, another\nqualified professional will be assigned.\nFor brokerage services that are self-directed, no financial services representative will be assigned to you. Our support\nservices will include customer service and broker assisted representatives should you have questions regarding your account.\nFor both assisted and self-directed accounts, you will always have access to Principals of the firm should you have\nconcerns about your assigned professional or any other matter. Please contact us at 800-872-0444 for any needs you may\nhave concerning Muriel Siebert, Siebert AdvisorNXT or your account.\nPage 4 of 4"
