Before we discuss the quarter's results, I'm pleased to introduce our new\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Patrick Brennan. Many of you are familiar with Patrick from\nhis prior company. He has significant insurance experience and a deep background in corporate finance. We\nbelieve he is ideally suited to lead our finance and investment operations. I'll ask Patrick to make a few\nintroductory remarks before we discuss the quarter's results. Patrick?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPatrick S. Brennan\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nThanks, John. I'm really excited to be here. I've known of Selective for a long time, dating back to 2006 when I sat\nnext to Greg Murphy at an investor conference and left not only impressed with him, but also the company he led.\nSelective is an industry leader with a differentiated operating model and track record and runway for profitable\ngrowth. The company's competitive advantages, strong foundation and excellent market reputation are why I\njoined the team. I'm very excited to partner with John, the other executives on his management team and our\nfinance team to help lead Selective into the future.\nI want to thank my new colleagues for their warm welcome and their eagerness to help. I especially would like to\nthank Tony for his steady leadership as interim CFO and for his generosity in helping me quickly onboard and get\nacquainted with Selective. I know many of you from when I sat in Brad's role at my prior company many years\nago. And I look forward to meeting those of you I haven't yet met. Over the coming months, I'll be speaking with\nyou about how we're allocating and investing your capital and focusing on long-term value creation.\nThanks, John, for this opportunity. It's great to be here.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nThanks, Patrick. I'd like to acknowledge Tony Harnett for his work as interim CFO. He's done an excellent job\nrunning our finance team and preparing for this transition. Tony will continue to serve as our Chief Accounting\nOfficer and remain a key executive leadership team member reporting to Patrick.\nLet me now turn to results. For the quarter, we generated operating earnings per share of $1.40 and an operating\nROE of 12.1%. Given the very elevated catastrophe losses, that added 13.4 points to our combined ratio. These\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nresults highlight our underlying profitability and strong contribution from investment income. Year-to-date\noperating ROE is 4.8%. Our full year guidance implies we will deliver an operating ROE in the high-single digit\nrange. This is below our 12% target, primarily due to our reserving actions in the first and second quarters, along\nwith catastrophe losses above our expectations in the first nine months of the year.\nBefore discussing segment results, I want to reinforce where our team is focused on creating value. Priority one is\ndelivering combined ratios in line with or better than our 95% target in each insurance segment. Our tactics vary\ndue to market dynamics and our competitive position in each segment, but we always strive to be a stable market\nfor our distribution partners and customers, generate long-term returns for our shareholders and invest in our\nbusiness employees and communities.\nIn recent quarters, we've discussed social inflation and its impact on severity trends. We believe these dynamics\nare impacting both Selective and the industry. The prudent reserve actions we've taken in recent quarters\nstrengthened our balance sheet and we experienced no further prior accident year development this quarter on\nour total casualty portfolio and general liability in particular. Despite this result, loss trends remain elevated and\nsocial inflationary pressures persist demanding our continued underwriting and claims discipline, prudence and\nexecution.\nWe continue to leverage our disciplined and detailed planning process based on our latest quarterly reserve\nreview and incorporate future pricing and loss trend assumptions to set realistic and achievable prospective\ncombined ratios. We update our model monthly with actual premiums written and rate changes, allowing us to\nquickly establish appropriate underwriting and pricing actions. The output from our planning process is also used\nto calibrate our risk selection, pricing and claims management tools that provide risk level guidance to our\nunderwriting claims staff. The actions we are taking to achieve renewal pure price increases and refine our book\nof business position us for the future success.\nSelective has long demonstrated these capabilities and I'm confident that we have the tools and team to execute\nin this environment. As mentioned, achieving our target profitability remains our top priority in standard\ncommercial lines we have pushed pricing higher, responding to the loss emergence and elevated severity in\nrecent quarters. While new business has moderated, we are willing to trade growth for profitability in the current\nloss trend environment. For renewal business, we delivered a meaningful increase in general liability pricing from\n7.6% in the second quarter to 10.2% in the third quarter. At the same time, renewal pure pricing in commercial\nproperty was 12% and commercial auto was 10.9%, holding steady with levels reported in recent quarters.\nOur regional teams achieved this renewal pricing while maintaining retention of 86% in Standard Commercial\nLines, as we look to protect a high-quality renewal portfolio and increase our pricing targets. Standard\nCommercial Lines renewal pure price accelerated this quarter to 9.1%, up 120 basis points from the second\nquarter's 7.9% and 200 basis points higher than a year ago.\nCommercial Lines pricing, excluding workers' compensation increased 10.2%. Exposure growth added 3.9 points,\ncontributing to our total renewal premium change of 13.4%. Adding new states and growing in states with lower\nmarket share should further diversify our property book and provide ample market opportunities within our existing\nappetite. We added Washington, Oregon and Nevada as Standard Commercial Lines states in early October,\nbringing the total number of states we have entered since 2017 to 13. We now offer Standard Commercial Lines\nin 35 states. Kansas, Montana and Wyoming are the next three states we expect to enter over the next two years.\nAfter that, our pace of geographic expansion will moderate as we move closer to our goal of operating across the\ncountry in our flagship Standard Commercial Lines business.\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nAcross our entire footprint Standard Commercial Lines net premiums written grew 8% in the quarter, driven by\n13.4 points of renewal premium change. Our combined ratio of 99.2% was above our 95% target due to elevated\ncatastrophe losses. While no single event was above our net reinsurance retention, Hurricane Helene\nrepresented a significant portion of total catastrophe losses. Despite the variability quarter-to-quarter, we remain\ncomfortable with our net catastrophe exposure, which we manage through strict coastal guidelines, appropriate\nrisk-based pricing, property aggregation management and our conservative reinsurance program. While we price\nand manage our business based on the all-in performance, we note the underlying combined ratio which excludes\nthese catastrophes was an excellent 87.7%, 2.7 points lower than a year ago.\nExcess Lines and Surplus Lines, now representing 12% of net premiums written, continued its strong\nperformance. Net premiums written increased 28% in the quarter, with an 83.2% combined ratio. Despite the\nhigher commissions paid in the E&S segment, our expense ratio of 30.7% in the quarter reflects our investments\nin building scale. Our focus in E&S is on maintaining very favorable levels of underwriting profitability and taking\nadvantage of attractive growth opportunities.\nPersonal Lines net premiums written decreased by 2% in the quarter, reflecting our actions to improve\nprofitability. We continue to take significant rate actions and promote growth in areas with rate adequacy.\nSimultaneously, we're limiting new business and non-renewing underperforming business in states needing\nadditional rate approvals. Renewal pure pricing was strong at 22.8% and our average policy size increased by\n19% as we shifted towards our target mass affluent segment. Declining new and renewal policy counts offset\nthose increases. Retention in the quarter was 75%, down 13 points from the third quarter of 2023.\nAcross homeowners, we are growing in a subset of our book where Coverage A values are over $500,000. We\nare progressing towards Personal Lines profitability as the quarter's underlying combined ratio improved by 15.3\npoints or 12 points, excluding the impact of NFIP claims handling fees compared to the third quarter of 2023.\nNonetheless, we have more work to do and remain highly focused on achieving rate adequacy and transitioning\nour book toward the mass affluent segment. So far, 2024 has been a challenging year. I am proud of our team's\nfocus and commitment to executing our strategy. Our strong capital position gives us flexibility to manage through\nthese market dynamics. Despite the quarter's elevated catastrophe losses, we delivered an operating ROE of\n12.1% in line with our target. We are confident in our ability to create value as we move forward. Let me now turn\nthe call to Tony, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnthony D. Harnett\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone.\nWe reported fully diluted net income of $1.47 per share in the third quarter and non-GAAP operating income of\n$1.40 per share. As a result, our year-to-date return on equity is 5% and operating return on equity is 4.8%. Our\nGAAP combined ratio was 99.5% in the quarter, including 13.4 points of catastrophe losses. Catastrophes were\nwidespread with 19 events impacting results. Hurricane Helene was the most significant, causing an estimated\n$85 million pre-tax loss.\nThere was no net prior-year casualty reserve development in the quarter. Modest favorable development of $10\nmillion, $5 million in both workers' compensation and bonds was offset by $10 million of reserve strengthening in\ncommercial auto. The favorable development in workers' compensation and bonds was related to accident years\n2021 and prior. The commercial auto action was severity driven-related to accident year 2023. As a result, we\nalso booked an additional $5 million of current year loss costs in commercial auto.\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nAs we noted last quarter, our updated full-year guidance reflected our decision to increase the current year loss\nratio by approximately 1.5 points, reflecting the severity emergence we observed in the 2020 through 2023\naccident years. This informed our loss ratio selection for the 2024 accident year. To that end, we recorded a $16\nmillion increase to current year loss costs as we earned the corresponding general liability premiums over the\ncourse of the third quarter.\nThis run rate adjustment drove the total current year loss cost of $21 million or 1.9% combined ratio points in the\nquarter. Nonetheless, our underlying combined ratio was excellent and improved 4.1 points from a year ago,\nmainly due to a 4.4-point reduction in non-catastrophe property losses. Property results are benefiting from\nrenewal pure price increases and modifying coverage terms and conditions. Anecdotally, we are seeing lower\nloss outcomes from implementing cosmetic damage exclusions, higher wind and hail deductibles, and roof\ndepreciation schedules. Even with these positive changes, non-catastrophe property losses are inherently\nvolatile. We assume they will return to a more normal level in the fourth quarter and have embedded that\nexpectation in our full-year guidance.\nNational Flood Insurance Program Write Your Own claims handling fees primarily related to Hurricane Helene\nbenefited the underlying combined ratio. These fees were $4.7 million, reducing the overall loss and LE ratio by\n0.4 points and the Personal Lines and LE ratio by 4.3 points in the quarter.\nOur expense ratio in the third quarter was 30.6%, 30 basis points better than a year ago. The expense ratio\nimprovement was due to reductions in expected profit-based employee compensation from our updated view of\n2024 underwriting performance. Our investment portfolio remains conservatively positioned. Fixed income and\nshort-term investments with an average credit quality of AA minus and a duration of 3.9 years, represented 92%\nof the portfolio on September 30.\nAfter tax net investment income was $93 million in the third quarter, up 16% from last year and contributed 13.1\npoints of ROE. Alternative investments, which report on a one quarter lag, generated $7.1 million of after-tax\nincome, up from $5.1 million a year ago. In the third quarter, we invested nearly $800 million of new money at an\naverage pre-tax yield of 5.8%. This increased the fixed income portfolio's overall pre-tax book yield modestly,\nending the quarter at approximately 4.9%.\nThe higher book yield embedded in our fixed income portfolio should provide a durable income source moving\nforward, even with the 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate during the quarter. Our capital position\nremains strong with a GAAP equity of $3.2 billion and statutory surplus of $2.8 billion. Book value per share\nincreased 7% from year-end and adjusted book value per share increased 2%. At the end of the quarter, our debt\nto capital ratio was 13.8%, well below our internal threshold of 25%.\nGiven our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity, we have the financial flexibility to support organic growth\nand execute our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 103,000 shares of\ncommon stock at an average price of $84.34 for a total of $8.7 million. That left $75.5 million remaining under our\nshare repurchase authorization at quarter-end. We expect to continue to use this opportunistically.\nWith our outlook for continued profitable growth, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend per common\nshare of $0.38, an increase of $0.03 or 9%. For 2024, we now expect our GAAP combined ratio to be 102.5%, up\nfrom our previous guidance of 101.5%. The 1-point increase reflects our higher catastrophe loss assumption,\nwhich is now 7.5 points.\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nBetter than expected, non-catastrophe property losses in the third quarter partially offset this, leading us to reduce\nthe full year underlying combined ratio by 1-point to 90%. It is too early to provide a specific estimate of Hurricane\nMilton, but based on its path, our minimal exposure in Florida and very early claims reporting, we expect our\nlosses from the event will be immaterial. Consistent with our typical process, we assume no additional prior\ncasualty reserve development.\nOur after-tax net investment income estimate of $360 million, including $32 million from alternative investments,\nremains unchanged. Our guidance includes an overall effective tax rate of 21%, with a 20.5% effective tax rate on\ninvestments and 21% on all other items. Fully diluted weighted average shares are estimated to be $61.5 million,\nand we make no assumptions for share repurchases under our existing authorization.\nBefore we get to questions-and-answers, I would like to take this opportunity to thank John, the rest of the\nexecutive leadership team and the Board of Directors for their unwavering support over the past year. After 25\nyears of service, it was an honor and a privilege to serve as the company's interim CFO. It has also been a\npleasure telling the Selective story and getting to know so many of you in the investor community. As I turn my\nfocus back to being the Chief Accounting Officer, I would like to take this opportunity to officially welcome Patrick\nto the Selective team.\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to please start our question-and-answer session.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Michael Phillips with\nOppenheimer. Your line is now open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMichael Phillips Q\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\nGood morning. Thanks, everybody. I guess – I was going to ask this question, and then, I definitely want to ask\nafter Tony's comments on some commercial auto stuff. So it's – I guess for clarification, it sounds like you added\n$10 million to the current year. Just want to confirm that, right Tony?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnthony D. Harnett A\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYes, that's correct, $10 million for the commercial...\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMichael Phillips Q\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\nOkay.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnthony D. Harnett A\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\n...auto to the current accident year.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMichael Phillips Q\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nOkay. So my question would be, I guess, given the nature of comments over the last few quarters, I mean, not\njust from you guys, of course, but from everybody else on the impacts of social inflation. I mean, I guess maybe\nhelp us to get comfortable with the extent to which that could spread more to commercial auto. You took $10\nmillion last quarter, $10 million this quarter. I think you took $10 million last quarter, pretty sure, and then $10\nmillion this quarter. So just help us get comfortable on the commercial auto reserves and to the extent to which\nwhat we saw for GL may not spread over because that – still $20 million is pretty small for the size of your\ncommercial auto book, and what you took for GL has been pretty, pretty extensive. So just help us get\ncomfortable with the commercial auto reserves, I guess, is the crux of the question. Thanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. Mike, thanks for the question. This is John, I can start on that. I guess a couple of things, and I believe\nwe've highlighted this before, I think the trends we've seen in commercial auto have been have persisted for\nlonger. We saw them start earlier and we've seen them persist. And to your point, the actions we've taken on prior\nyear are relatively small and largely focused on the 2023 accident year, driven by severities. And much like we did\nin GL last quarter when we saw some small movement in the most recent prior year, we opted to make a small\nadjustment to the current year.\nBut the difference here is these trends that we've pointed out with regard to commercial auto have remained\nrelatively stable, albeit elevated, and that's been for an extended period of time. But if you look at the pricing in\ncommercial auto and this is a Selective comment as much as it is an industry comment, commercial auto pricing\nhas been a lot stronger for a lot longer.\nOur commercial auto pricing, even in the current year, is 10.9% in the quarter, 10.7% on a year-to-date basis. And\nif you strip out the prior year emergence and look back over the last couple of years on an accident year basis, up\nand through this year, that line is running for us right around at 98% and you've got strong run rate coming\nthrough there. So I view it very differently than I view GL, which is the emergence in GL from a severity\nperspective, has been more recent and evidenced more recently, whereas you had a longer term track record in\nauto that's been responded to from a pricing perspective on a more consistent basis.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnthony D. Harnett A\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nAnd Mike, it's Tony, just one point of clarification. On the commercial auto, the prior year development was $10\nmillion, and it was $10 million last quarter for prior development. The current year actions was actually $5 million.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMichael Phillips Q\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\nOkay. Yeah. Right. Thank you. And then thanks for the comment, that's helpful, and makes sense. I guess let's\ntake that maybe just more broadly on social inflation. John, you're not unlike others who have talked about it for a\nwhile. And I think the difference is that you've taken some pretty significant charges. Good, that you've got – I\nthink, to your track record of what I know about Selective is you see you take early, we hear that from other\ncompanies we haven't really – to me we haven't seen the extent to which you've taken GL.\nAnd so the question then becomes, do you think that or how confident are you that what you've seen isn't just a\nmicrocosm of what you write and more specific to your book of business and maybe won't be widespread through\nthe industry, or if it is, then it's just a matter of time until everything else happens for everybody else. Thanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. Yeah. So, again, appreciate the question. First thing I'll say is, when your book is as stable as ours is and\nyou look at our portfolio over a long period of time, it's incredibly stable from an industry classification perspective,\nfrom a limits profile perspective, and even from a geographic perspective. And while we've expanded our\nfootprint, the portfolio distribution from a GL perspective it remains relatively stable.\nAnd then you look at the pricing diagnostics on a new and renewal basis and you see a lot of stability there. It's\nsomething external that's pushing those average severities higher. And I know I've pointed to this in the past,\nwhile there are some jurisdictional challenges in our footprint that I pointed out, in particular states like Georgia\nand like New York and certain parts of Illinois, there are a number of jurisdictions not in our footprint like\nCalifornia, Texas and Florida that have been driving a lot of the nuclear verdicts and a lot of the active attorney\nengagement that are also sort of industry wide trends. This is not a class specific environmental shift. Any time\nyou have a bodily injury claim, whether that bodily injury claim is in a construction class or is in a retail class or a\nmanufacturing class, a bodily injury claim is what puts you us in this environment where you have social inflation,\nhigher litigation rates, you've got jury pools that are more willing to give out higher awards. And that's why I think\nwe're pretty confident that this is, in fact, an industry wide trend.\nNow, with regard to the reserving actions, if you look back over the last several years, the GL line for the entire\nindustry has emerged extremely unfavorably, primarily for the years – accident years, 2020 and prior. And I think\non a full industry basis, over the last three years or four years, that adverse emergence has totaled somewhere in\nthe neighborhood of $18 billion. And it's been pretty consistent. What you haven't yet seen is those more recent\nyears emerge unfavorably and every company is going to be different.\nEvery company has a different portfolio, and every company has a different planning and reserving process.\nBut I think it's instructive if you look company-by-company at where the 2019 and prior years are currently for GL\nand assume they're relatively mature and then project that forward by looking at what those companies have\ndisclosed in terms of their forward loss trend assumption and what they've earned on a rate basis. And take up,\nexercise your own judgment as to whether or not you think that all hangs together. And I think from our\nperspective, with the actions we've taken in the more recent years and our updated view of loss trends, as well as\nhow we're pricing on a go-forward basis is the right approach for us. And that continues to be our focus.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMichael Phillips Q\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\nOkay. No, thank you, John, for all that. It's very helpful. I guess congrats on to Patrick and thanks to Tony for all\nyour help in the past year. Thanks, Guys.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnthony D. Harnett A\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nThanks, Mike.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPatrick S. Brennan A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nThanks, Mike.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nOperator: And the next question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMike Zaremski Q\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp.\nHey, thanks. Good morning. Now, maybe first question is sticking to – or going back to commercial auto. I know I\nknow Patrick Brennan – just congrats, by the way, you just started on October 1, but Progressive obviously has a\n– is one of the you know preeminent commercial auto writers in the US. I was just curious, did the work – the\ncharges taken this quarter or the addition to reserves on commercial auto, is that due to a reserve study that\nPatrick was a part of or is Patrick going to be doing a deep dive in the coming months as he gets more acclimated\nto the company?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. So this is John, and I appreciate the question. I know there's been a lot of a lot of speculation and\ndiscussion around this. And I think it's important to restate our process. First of all, Patrick joined on October 1,\nand we're thrilled to have Patrick onboard. And Patrick certainly has a strong background and a set of\nexperiences that are additive to the team and to the process. And while we're confident in our processes, we're\nalways looking for opportunities to refine that.\nBut I think it's also important to restate the approach we've had for a long time. And when I say a long time, I'm\ntalking decades that predate my role at the company, 26 years ago when I started, which is our reserving\nprocess. First and foremost, the Chief Actuary in our organization and the current Chief Actuary, Vince Senia, has\nbeen here for a long time and was prior the Lead Reserving Actuary. Chief Actuary reports to the CEO in our\norganizational structure and is a peer to the CFO, and is heavily involved in the management decision relative to\nreserves alongside of the CFO and the CEO.\nTony in his role prior as Chief Accounting Officer and then serving as the interim Chief Financial Officer has been\nheavily engaged and involved in that process over the long-term. And there's – I realize there's been speculation\nabout the CFO change, but the way our process has worked – has always worked and will continue to work, there\nare multiple people, myself included, that have been involved and we'll continue to be involved in that process,\nthat have a voice and weigh in on those decisions.\nWith regard to commercial auto in particular, I think Patrick's background is going to be beneficial. And as I said\nearlier, his voice and his experience will be instrumental in those decisions we make going forward. But the\nprocess has been very consistent at our organization.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMike Zaremski Q\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp.\nYeah. That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe going through the Standard Commercial Lines underlying loss ratio, one\nof the best underlying ratio in years, you called out. We can see your good disclosure on non-catastrophe\nproperty losses benefiting. So just kind of a – I just want to make sure we're thinking about the right way, should\nwe be kind of averaging non-catastrophe property losses over longer periods of time, similar to the catastrophe\nload. Is there kind of an upwards bend to non-catastrophe property losses and total cat losses as we kind of think\nabout the trend line there. I just want to build with the – your targets not to run rate the underlying this quarter.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nYeah. I guess a couple of things and Tony can certainly weigh in as well. I think your starting point and we give\nyou a lot of disclosure around trends. And in more recent years, we've been breaking that trend assumption down\nin between property and casualty, and for 2024 our all-in trend assumption of 7% assumes a property trend that\nwas closer to 4%. And we're earning rate in the commercial property line in particular at around 12%. If you look\nat last year 2023 and the current run rate this year of 2024 a little over 12% plus whatever portion of exposure\npickup that you want to view as profit positive, margin positive. We generally don't. We just focus on the rate\nnumber, but there's a positive gap there that continues to earn its way through. So I think there's a clear benefit\nthere on the commercial, and now we're starting to turn the corner on personal property that impacts that.\nOn the cat side, as you've seen from us, our expected cat loads have been going higher over the last several\nyears and continue to move higher. And our assumption for 2024 so far that gets built into our forward pricing\nassumptions. If you look at it for us, I think we've seen more volatility in the quarterly and annual cat loads for the\nPersonal Lines book than we have for commercial. While commercial has gone higher, the range around\nvariability and cat loads for commercial has been a little bit tighter or a fair amount tighter than it has in Personal\nLines. But there's a pricing dynamic to that as well.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnthony D. Harnett A\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. The only thing I would have added, John, was just I agree that the pricing have a positive impact on the\nnon-cat property, but obviously there's some normal variability there as well. So I think the way you described\ntaking a look at multiple periods and averaging them would be prudent. In fact, when you look at overall guidance,\nwe expect a more normalization of non-cat in the fourth quarter, which is embedded in the guidance we've put out\nthere. So I think your approach sounds reasonable.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMike Zaremski Q\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp.\nOkay. That's very helpful. And just lastly, quickly on the Personal Lines, the flood claim handling fees, should\nthose continue to trickle into the Q4 and or next year?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnthony D. Harnett A\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. I mean, I think all in all, most of them, I think we have them estimated and contained to the current quarter.\nSo I believe the number we put out for the current quarter is accurate and there won't be much if any real bleed\ninto the fourth quarter. And with regards to Milton, like we said, it's pretty immaterial. So we don't expect there to\nbe much with regards to that particular storm and flood piece either.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nAnd there's a normal claim flood volume that is in our results yearly. But when you have these bigger events, you\nget a little bit of a higher impact on the claims revenue portion of that operation.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMike Zaremski Q\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp.\nThank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And the next question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n11\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nPaul Newsome Q\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler & Co.\nSquarely in the category, I'm curious. The Hurricane Helene losses, if you pull those out would the cat load be\nsort of roughly the normal zone. And the...\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPaul Newsome Q\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler & Co.\n...other question is, I was just curious if you – if you could get any thoughts about the mix of Hurricane Helene and\nwhether from your perspective, it was typically a fairly typical for those storms that are fairly new?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. So just with regard to the impact and I think we had some of this in the prepared comments, the overall\nimpact on the quarterly cat load or combined ratio was 7.6 points. So if you back that out, it's a slightly above\naverage quarter, call it 6 points or 5.8 points...\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnthony D. Harnett A\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\n5.8 points. Yeah.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. So it's a relatively in line quarter absent Helene. I think and you've seen it already that the industry loss\nestimates for Helene have been going higher as the storm has aged. And I think what was underappreciated with\nthat storm is while there was all the focus on the landfall in the Big Bend region, the size of that wind field and as\nfar into the Southeast as that wind field had penetrated by the time the eye made landfall, I think has generated a\nlot more wind driven losses and devastation to a number of areas in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\nAnd from that perspective, it wasn't a coastal event. A lot of those impacts were felt pretty, pretty far inland. So I\nthink that's where maybe a little bit of the misses in terms of the overall expectation for the size of that loss.\nAnd when you have a loss at the end of the quarter, our focus is on getting the estimate right and getting the cat\nloss in the right quarter. And we've got a pretty disciplined process around that. So we feel good about the\nestimate we have of $85 million for the Helene in total.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPaul Newsome Q\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler & Co.\nAnd then maybe just one question in addition, if we think about sort of what you're doing from a pricing and\ncompetitive perspective and the change in your business, that you mentioned, are we going to see or do you think\nyou expect to see more of a shift in the business mix towards property within Selective? Or do you think that at\nthe end of day will kind of end up being fairly similar mix of what you're doing today perspectively?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n12\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. I think you're likely to see a shift towards home, but I don't think the magnitude is going to be all that\nsignificant. First thing is your average home premium continues to be much higher than we've seen historically.\nJust because the replacement costs are meaningfully higher. And I think when you look at the competitor set and\nthe market we're targeting, I think there's fewer competitors with the product offering for the mass affluent market\nlike work like we have.\nAnd there are certainly some, but there are fewer competitors there, whereas the auto space continues to be\nmuch more competitive and serve by a broader competitor set. So I think both of those combined impacts will\nlikely lead towards a little bit of a shift towards home as a percentage of the overall mix.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPaul Newsome Q\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler & Co.\nI appreciate the help, as always. Thank you, guys.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nThank you, Paul.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And the next question comes from Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nScott Heleniak Q\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\nYes, good morning. I was just curious, you guys used to give out the rate differential between your best\nperforming accounts and kind of your lowest performing accounts. I wondering if you had that data available now,\nyou're able to share or just curious how that how that's kind of changed over the past year, that kind of spread, if\nyou have that, if not, that's fine, too.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. And that – and I don't know if we posted the updated investor presentation, we have the investor\npresentation it's in there every quarter on an updated basis. We've had that in there for probably at least a decade\nnow. And I would say overall you see a pretty consistent path with regard -- or you see a pattern with regard to\naverage rate by retention bucket and then retentions by those same tranches. And you see a path that shows as\nthe rate has gone higher while the entire curve has gone higher with regard to cohort, it's certainly you see a\nhigher rate level and therefore a lower retention for that worst 10%. When I say worse based on expected forward\nloss ratios. So you've seen a little bit more tilt in that direction, but that is available on the investor presentation...\n[indiscernible] (00:44:11)\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnthony D. Harnett A\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nPage 15 of the investor package if you're looking for it.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n13\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nScott Heleniak Q\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\nGot it. Okay. And then just curious on the rate trajectory in Personal Lines, that's been on the rise. Some of the\nothers have talked about that not potentially decelerating a little bit from here. So I'm just – I'm curious what you're\nexpecting in your book for 2025, based on your filed rate increases and how you're kind of balancing that with\nretention, how you're just thinking about that overall as you build out the high-net worth business.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. So we on a state-by-state basis, we're updating our pricing indications on a very regular basis and filing\naccordingly. I think as you look, you'll see the blended rate number of 22.8% for the quarter. And obviously there\nare some significant variance state-by-state. And certainly a few states that are still had some regulatory hurdles\nto getting approvals on the adequate rate level.\nBut as we update those indications and update our forward view of loss trends, that'll drive our rate indications\nand we're going to continue to file our indications until we achieve that target combined ratio on a run rate basis.\nSo I'm not going to give you at this point a 2025 rate expectation number, but certainly getting to rate adequacy\non a state-by-state basis is the objective. And based on what we've filed, we have a number of states that are at\nrate adequate at this point. And we expect that's where the new business growth will be coming from going\nforward in the states that aren't rate adequate, we've taken actions to slow or completely curtail the flow of new\nbusiness in those states. So I guess that's how I would describe it in terms of where we are. And then obviously\nyou've seen the strong improvement in the underlying combined ratio. There's more work to be done there and a\nlot of that work will be done by the earning of the rate that you're currently seeing on a written basis through the\nbalance of 2025.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nScott Heleniak Q\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\nOkay. That's helpful detail. And then just the last one I have was just on the loss trend and GL, was there any\nchange on that? I think it was 9% in the second quarter is that still running around that same rate? Any change\nthere?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah, I would say there's no change in our trends assumptions and based on what you see and we took through\nlast quarter both historical trend for the more recent accident years and our view of forward loss trends are stable\nfrom last quarter.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nScott Heleniak Q\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\nGot it. Thanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nThank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Grace Carter with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n14\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nGrace H. Carter Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\nHi, everyone. Looking at...\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nGood morning, Grace.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGrace H. Carter Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\n...retention in the – yeah good morning. I'm looking at retention in the Standard Commercial book this quarter. It\nhung in there very well, even with the pretty material step-up in overall renewal rate increases. So I guess I'm just\nkind of wondering if you could update us on sort of your distribution partners reactions to the rate increases you've\nbeen taking.\nAnd if you expect retention to continue to be able to stay at these levels over the next few quarters, as you\ncontinue to go through these rate actions, I mean, it sounds like, all of your peers are kind of reacting and share\nsome concerns on social inflation and so forth. But I just kind of wanted your updated views on that.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. Thanks, Grace. So I guess it's important to recognize that our – the rate that we're talking about here is not\na dramatic shift from where we've been running. Yes, the movement in GL has been pretty substantial and we\nthink appropriate getting up to 10%. But on an overall basis, we're at a little over 9% in the quarter for commercial,\nand a little over 8% on a year-to-date basis. And yes, it's a move, but it's not a move that creates so much\ndisruption that it should have a substantial impact on retentions.\nNow, that's purely speculation at this point. There's a market dynamic that will come into play here, and I think\nthat's something that will evolve over time. I will say that from a new business perspective, the GL pricing\nenvironment for new is not necessarily as conservative, as maybe some of the rhetoric would suggest in the\nmarketplace.\nSo the talk of social inflation is pretty consistent. The view of elevated loss trends is pretty consistent across the\nmarket, but I think there are still pockets of pretty significant competition on GL by a number of market\nparticipants. I don't know how that plays out in coming quarters, but the comment I made earlier about being at a\npoint where our pricing objectives and our profitability targets are objective 1, and if that creates a little bit of a\ngrowth trade for us, we're comfortable with that. And I think that's an important point.\nNow, that said, when you look at the investments we've made in adding production outlets through geographic\nexpansion, through new agency appointments, deploying of additional resources, even if hit ratios come under\npressure, because our pricing stance might be more conservative than the rest of the market at this point. The\naddition of production outlets, I think, gives us continued path for growth and opportunity for growth on a go-\nforward basis. So a complicated answer to a pretty direct question. I apologize for that. But it's a dynamic\nenvironment.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n15\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nGrace H. Carter Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\nThank you. And then I guess on premium to Surplus, it's still a little bit above kind of the long-term target range, I\nguess, is there a particular kind of trajectory that you'll see that or particular timeline that you'll see that kind of\nnaturally returning to the target range? And how much of a priority is getting that back to sort of that 1.35 to 1.55\ntimes, or is this just one metric out of many that you all look at, and it doesn't really matter?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. So it's certainly, it's a metric that we measure and we talk about, so it matters. But your point is spot on\nGrace, which is – it's one of several metrics relative to capital adequacy that obviously the biggest drawback in\npremiums-to-surplus ratio is the fact that it doesn't account for holding company capital. And obviously when you\nput that into the mix, I think that's why the other capital metrics are as strong as they are.\nSo again, our expectation is to be in that range or desired range over time and we see a path to getting back into\nthat range. But that could be cured relatively immediately or essentially immediately based on incorporating\nholding company capital. So it is a metric that matters, but it is always viewed in the context of forward earnings\npotential and how other capital metrics stand.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGrace H. Carter Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\nThank you .\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And the next question comes from Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMeyer Shields Q\nAnalyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.\nGreat. Thanks. And good morning. Two, I guess, questions on property losses and I know you talked about this a\nlittle bit but I was wondering if there's any way of – or talk about how you determine that the lower-than-expected\nnon-cat weather, that's not a function of the fact that there were a lot of cat losses maybe pushing losses above\nthe threshold.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. So this is – let me just be clear, this is not non-cat weather only. This is non-cat property losses in total.\nThat includes commercial property, personal property, it includes auto physical damage. And generally speaking,\nthere shouldn't be – we have a consistent definition of what are cats, which we do and it's PCS designation for us,\nthey should be relatively independent of each other.\nAnd there's a frequency and a severity component to your non-cat property losses, which is what creates the\nvariability that we've talked about historically. But there shouldn't be a favorable impact on non-cat property when\nyou have a higher cat loss quarter or year.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnthony D. Harnett A\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\n16\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nAnd to that point, I would just say that the two biggest loss types are auto, as John referred to, and the other\nwould be fire losses. And the two of those generally make up, if you look at year-to-date, about 70% of the non-\ncat property.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMeyer Shields Q\nAnalyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.\nOkay. That's very helpful. Thank you. The second question, when you've got a quarter like this with elevated\ncatastrophe losses, is there any way of quantifying maybe the impact on incentive compensation either to\nemployees or to agents?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. So I guess the first thing is our incentive compensation program for employees is driven by combined ratio\nall-in, so we don't exclude cat losses. So a high cat year will put downward pressure on the 50% of the incentive\ncomp pool that's driven by financial performance in the current year. So we don't strip that out.\nAnd I would say the same thing applies with regard to agency compensation. Our profit sharing plan for agents\nincludes a one year and a multiyear profit component. Now there's always a lag and a lot of the heavy cat losses\nin a given quarter are going to be in IBNR, especially when it happens when the event happens at the end of a\nquarter, but ultimately, as those payments come through. There is an individual catastrophe event cap for\nindividual agents that mitigates some of that, but it certainly does impact profit sharing payouts when you have\nlarge events.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnthony D. Harnett A\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. And just to tie it together, the 30 basis point improvement in the expense ratio in the quarter and the almost\n1 point for the year-to-date is heavily driven by the employee compensation and the variability of that, as John\nmentioned.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMeyer Shields Q\nAnalyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.\nOkay. Perfect. That's what I need. Thank you so much.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nThank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Matt Carletti with Citizens JMP. Your line is\nopen.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMatthew J. Carletti Q\nAnalyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC\nHey, thanks. Good morning. First question, in past quarters, you've given cats by line within standard commercial.\nDo you have that handy for the $100 million or so of cats for this quarter?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n17\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc.\n(SIGI) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nAnthony D. Harnett A\nSenior Vice President & Chief Accounting Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. The property is $93.7 million. The BOP was $4.4 million. And the commercial auto was $2.3 million for the\ntotal Commercial Lines of $100.4 million.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMatthew J. Carletti Q\nAnalyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC\nAll right. Great. Thank you. And then my next question, little more of kind of longer term specific to Standard\nPersonal Lines. Once you get past the profit improvement actions, can you just – what do you see over the next\nseveral years in terms of where you'd like to take that business?\nIt's a roughly 10% of the pie today with a relatively small state footprint. Is that basically kind of the size and scale,\nthe business that you hope to kind of just maintain a good profitability longer term? Or is this something that you\nhope to grow a little more, maybe that includes expanded footprint. Maybe that's just more penetration in states\nyou already have.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J. Marchioni A\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Selective Insurance Group, Inc.\nYeah. No, thanks, Matt. It's a great question. And again, I characterize this just as you asked the question, which\nis sort of a longer term view. So near-term, our objective is to prove that we can, in fact, compete successfully in\nthis target market. And I think we're showing the signs of doing that. But when you think about having a business\nthat targets a smaller addressable market, which is what we're doing.\nI think you want to make sure that you're tapping into that smaller addressable market as maximum away as\npossible, which means state expansion. And I think there would clearly be opportunities for us to address that\nmarket better by expanding our footprint. But again, it's – that's the second step. The first step is the execution in\nour existing states. And I think we're on a pretty good path here to prove that we can be a strong competitor there.\nAnd then we'll start to invest in potentially expanding the footprint of that business again in a disciplined way,\nbecause we also are always going to be mindful of the overall cat profile – cat exposure profile of the of the entity\nin total. So I think we would look to expand that while creating a more diversified book from a cat exposure\nperspective as well.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMatthew J. Carletti Q\nAnalyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC\nOkay. Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for the color.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to John for closing\nremarks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn J.

(NASDAQ: SIGI) reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, with net income per diluted common share of $1.47 and non-GAAP operating income1 per diluted common share of $1.40. Return on common equity was 12.6% and non-GAAP operating ROE1 was 12.1%. \n\nNPW increased 9% from a year ago driven by accelerating renewal pure price increases and stable Standard Commercial Lines retention. The investments segment generated 13.1 points of annualized ROE in the quarter, as after-tax net investment income was $93 million, up 16% from a year ago. \n\nFor the quarter, Selective reported a combined ratio of 99.5% with no net prior year casualty reserve development. Elevated catastrophe losses of $149 million increased the combined ratio by 13.4 points, up from 6.6 points a year ago. Losses resulted from 19 named storms in the quarter, with Hurricane Helene estimated at $85 million of pre-tax losses. \n\n“The continued frequency and severity of storms in the third quarter, including the devastation from Hurricane Helene, underscore our unwavering commitment to our customers, agency partners, and communities. During these challenging times for those impacted by the storms, I thank my colleagues for continuing to deliver superior claims service and supporting customers and claimants,” said John J. Marchioni, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \n\n“We maintain a disciplined approach to pricing and underwriting our business. Loss trends remain elevated and uncertain, but we continue to be prudent and vigilant in addressing them. In the quarter, renewal pure price increased 10.5%. In Standard Commercial Lines, renewal pure price accelerated to 9.1%. For General Liability, the line most impacted by loss emergence in previous quarters, renewal pure price was 10.2%, up from 7.6% in the second quarter. Importantly, retention was stable in Standard Commercial Lines at 86%.” \n\n“Our primary goal is to consistently achieve our 95% combined ratio target. Although catastrophe losses impacted the quarter, our underlying performance was excellent, reflecting our underwriting and pricing actions and disciplined expense management. We added Nevada, Oregon, and Washington to our Standard Commercial Lines footprint in early October, now covering 35 states. With our strong capital position, financial flexibility, and strategic execution, we are well positioned to face the uncertainty in the external environment,” concluded Mr. Marchioni. \n\n**Operating Highlights**\n\n**Consolidated Financial Results**| **Quarter ended****September 30,**| **Change**| **Year-to-Date****September 30,**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n _$ and shares in millions, except per share data_| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet premiums written |  $ |  1,157.6 |  1,058.3 |  9 |  % |  $ |  3,540.4 |  3,143.0 |  13 |  %   \nNet premiums earned |  1,112.2 |  981.9 |  13 |  3,243.4 |  2,826.4 |  15   \nNet investment income earned |  117.8 |  100.9 |  17 |  334.3 |  290.1 |  15   \nNet realized and unrealized gains (losses), pre-tax |  5.4 |  (6.9 |  ) |  (178 |  ) |  5.1 |  (9.0 |  ) |  (156 |  )   \nTotal revenues |  1,244.3 |  1,081.1 |  15 |  3,605.3 |  3,121.4 |  16   \nNet underwriting income (loss), after-tax |  4.1 |  25.0 |  (83 |  ) |  (118.0 |  ) |  54.7 |  (316 |  )   \nNet investment income, after-tax |  93.4 |  80.2 |  16 |  265.3 |  231.1 |  15   \nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders |  90.0 |  86.9 |  4 |  104.6 |  233.5 |  (55 |  )   \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss)1|  85.7 |  92.3 |  (7 |  ) |  100.6 |  240.6 |  (58 |  )   \nCombined ratio |  99.5 |  % |  96.8 |  2.7 |  pts |  104.6 |  % |  97.5 |  7.1 |  pts   \nLoss and loss expense ratio |  68.8 |  65.8 |  3.0 |  73.8 |  65.7 |  8.1   \nUnderwriting expense ratio |  30.6 |  30.9 |  (0.3 |  ) |  30.6 |  31.6 |  (1.0 |  )   \nDividends to policyholders ratio |  0.1 |  0.1 |  — |  0.2 |  0.2 |  —   \nNet catastrophe losses |  13.4 |  pts |  6.6 |  6.8 |  9.1 |  pts |  7.8 |  1.3   \nNon-catastrophe property losses and loss expenses |  13.2 |  17.6 |  (4.4 |  ) |  15.5 |  16.9 |  (1.4 |  )   \n(Favorable) unfavorable prior year reserve development on casualty lines |  — |  — |  — |  6.5 |  (0.6 |  ) |  7.1   \nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share |  $ |  1.47 |  1.42 |  4 |  % |  $ |  1.71 |  3.83 |  (55 |  ) |  %   \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) per diluted common share1|  1.40 |  1.51 |  (7 |  ) |  1.64 |  3.95 |  (58 |  )   \nWeighted average diluted common shares |  61.3 |  61.0 |  — |  61.3 |  60.9 |  1   \nBook value per common share |  $ |  48.82 |  40.35 |  21 |  $ |  48.82 |  40.35 |  21   \nAdjusted book value per common share1|  50.80 |  48.54 |  5 |  50.80 |  48.54 |  5   \n  \n**Overall Insurance Operations**\n\nFor the third quarter, overall NPW increased 9%, or $99 million, from a year ago. Average renewal pure price increased 10.5%, up 3.5 points from a year ago. Selective's 99.5% combined ratio was 2.7 points higher than a year ago, as elevated catastrophe losses were partially offset by lower non-catastrophe property losses and a lower expense ratio. There was no net unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in either period. The combined ratio excluding net catastrophe losses and prior year casualty reserve development was 86.1%, 4.1 points lower than a year ago. \n\nOverall, our insurance segments increased ROE by 0.6 points in the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**Standard Commercial Lines Segment**\n\nFor the third quarter, Standard Commercial Lines premiums (representing 78% of total NPW) grew 8% from a year ago. The premium growth reflected average renewal pure price increases of 9.1% and stable retention of 86%. The third quarter combined ratio was 99.2%, up 4.5 points from a year ago, primarily due to catastrophe losses. \n\nThere was no net prior year casualty reserve development in the quarter, compared to $3.0 million, or 0.4 points, of favorable development a year ago. \n\nThe following table shows the variances in key quarter-to-date and year-to date measures: \n\n**Standard Commercial Lines Segment**| **Quarter ended****September 30,**| **Change**| **Year-to-Date****September 30,**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n _$ in millions_| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet premiums written |  $ |  903.9 |  833.6 |  8 |  % |  $ |  2,798.7 |  2,517.0 |  11 |  %   \nNet premiums earned |  875.4 |  785.3 |  11 |  2,563.0 |  2,279.7 |  12   \nCombined ratio |  99.2 |  % |  94.7 |  4.5 |  pts |  105.6 |  % |  95.5 |  10.1 |  pts   \nLoss and loss expense ratio |  67.6 |  62.8 |  4.8 |  74.0 |  63.0 |  11.0   \nUnderwriting expense ratio |  31.4 |  31.7 |  (0.3 |  ) |  31.4 |  32.3 |  (0.9 |  )   \nDividends to policyholders ratio |  0.2 |  0.2 |  — |  0.2 |  0.2 |  —   \nNet catastrophe losses |  11.5 |  pts |  4.7 |  6.8 |  7.4 |  pts |  5.9 |  1.5   \nNon-catastrophe property losses and loss expenses |  11.0 |  15.6 |  (4.6 |  ) |  13.1 |  14.9 |  (1.8 |  )   \n(Favorable) unfavorable prior year reserve development on casualty lines |  — |  (0.4 |  ) |  0.4 |  8.2 |  (0.9 |  ) |  9.1   \n  \n**Standard Personal Lines Segment**\n\nFor the third quarter, Standard Personal Lines premiums (representing 10% of total NPW) decreased 2% from a year ago with renewal pure price of 22.8% and higher average policy sizes. Retention was 75%, down 13 points from a year ago, and new business decreased 49% due to deliberate profit improvement actions. Despite elevated catastrophe losses, the third quarter 2024 combined ratio decreased by 5.3 points from a year ago to 122.1%. There was no prior year casualty reserve development in the quarter, compared to $3 million in unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in personal auto a year ago. Flood claims handling fees from the National Flood Insurance Program's Write Your Own program, primarily related to Hurricane Helene, reduced the loss and loss expense ratio by 4.3 points in the quarter, up from 1.2 points in the prior-year period. \n\nThe following table shows the variances in key quarter-to-date and year-to-date measures: \n\n**Standard Personal Lines Segment**| **Quarter ended****September 30,**| **Change**| **Year-to-Date****September 30,**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n _$ in millions_| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet premiums written |  $ |  111.0 |  113.2 |  (2 |  ) |  % |  $ |  327.1 |  307.5 |  6 |  %   \nNet premiums earned |  107.5 |  95.2 |  13 |  317.8 |  264.2 |  20   \nCombined ratio |  122.1 |  % |  127.4 |  (5.3 |  ) |  pts |  115.2 |  % |  123.6 |  (8.4 |  ) |  pts   \nLoss and loss expense ratio |  98.7 |  104.5 |  (5.8 |  ) |  91.8 |  98.7 |  (6.9 |  )   \nUnderwriting expense ratio |  23.4 |  22.9 |  0.5 |  23.4 |  24.9 |  (1.5 |  )   \nNet catastrophe losses |  38.8 |  pts |  25.6 |  13.2 |  24.8 |  pts |  22.8 |  2.0   \nNon-catastrophe property losses and loss expenses |  35.3 |  44.7 |  (9.4 |  ) |  39.4 |  43.2 |  (3.8 |  )   \nUnfavorable prior year reserve development on casualty lines |  — |  3.2 |  (3.2 |  ) |  — |  3.4 |  (3.4 |  )   \n  \n**Excess and Surplus Lines Segment**\n\nFor the third quarter, Excess and Surplus Lines premiums (representing 12% of total NPW) increased 28% compared to the prior-year period, driven by new business growth of 43% and average renewal pure price increases of 8.0%.

The after-tax income yield averaged 4.0% for the overall and fixed income securities portfolios. With this and invested assets per dollar of common stockholders' equity of $3.25 as of September 30, 2024, the Investments segment generated 13.1 points of non-GAAP operating ROE. \n\n**Investments Segment**| **Quarter ended****September 30,**| **Change**| **Year-to-Date****September 30,**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n _$ in millions, except per share data_| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet investment income earned, after-tax |  $ |  93.4 |  80.2 |  16 |  % |  $ |  265.3 |  231.1 |  15 |  %   \nNet investment income per common share |  1.52 |  1.31 |  16 |  4.33 |  3.79 |  14   \nEffective tax rate |  20.7 |  % |  20.5 |  0.2 |  pts |  20.6 |  % |  20.3 |  0.3 |  pts   \nAverage yields:   \nPortfolio:   \nPre-tax |  5.0 |  4.9 |  0.1 |  4.9 |  4.8 |  0.1   \nAfter-tax |  4.0 |  3.9 |  0.1 |  3.9 |  3.8 |  0.1   \nFixed income securities:   \nPre-tax |  5.0 |  % |  5.1 |  (0.1 |  ) |  pts |  4.9 |  % |  5.0 |  (0.1 |  ) |  pts   \nAfter-tax |  4.0 |  4.1 |  (0.1 |  ) |  3.9 |  4.0 |  (0.1 |  )   \nAnnualized ROE contribution |  13.1 |  13.1 |  — |  12.6 |  12.7 |  (0.1 |  )   \n  \n**Balance Sheet**\n\n$ in millions, except per share data | **September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \nTotal assets |  $ |  13,473.1 |  11,802.5 |  14 |  %   \nTotal investments |  9,635.3 |  8,693.7 |  11   \nLong-term debt |  508.2 |  503.9 |  1   \nStockholders’ equity |  3,167.8 |  2,954.4 |  7   \nCommon stockholders' equity |  2,967.8 |  2,754.4 |  8   \nInvested assets per dollar of common stockholders’ equity |  3.25 |  3.16 |  3   \nNet premiums written to policyholders' surplus |  1.63 |  1.51 |  8   \nBook value per common share |  48.82 |  45.42 |  7   \nAdjusted book value per common share1|  50.80 |  50.03 |  2   \nDebt to total capitalization |  13.8 |  % |  14.6 |  % |  (0.8 |  ) |  pts   \n  \nBook value per common share increased by $3.40, or 7%, during the first nine months of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.61 decrease in after-tax net unrealized losses on our fixed income securities portfolio and $1.71 of net income per diluted common share, partially offset by $1.05 in common stockholder dividends. The decrease in after-tax net unrealized losses on our fixed income securities portfolio was primarily related to lower interest rates. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 103,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $84.34 for $8.7 million. Capacity under the existing repurchase authorization was $75.5 million as of September 30, 2024. \n\nSelective's Board of Directors declared: \n\n  * A 9% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $0.38 per common share that is payable December 2, 2024, to holders of record on November 15, 2024; and \n  * A quarterly cash dividend of $287.50 per share on our 4.60% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (equivalent to $0.28750 per depositary share) payable on December 16, 2024, to holders of record as of December 2, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Guidance**\n\nFor 2024, we increased our expected GAAP combined ratio to 102.5%. The change reflects the third quarter's elevated catastrophe losses, partially offset by better-than-expected non-catastrophe property losses. Full-year expectations are as follows: \n\n  * A GAAP combined ratio of 102.5%, up 1 point from our prior guidance of 101.5%. Our combined ratio estimate includes net catastrophe losses of 7.5 points, up from prior guidance of 5.5 points. Although too early to provide a specific estimate, we expect losses from Hurricane Milton, which made landfall on October 9, 2024, to be immaterial. Our combined ratio estimate assumes no additional prior year casualty reserve development; \n  * After-tax net investment income of $360 million that includes $32 million from alternative investments; \n  * An overall effective tax rate of approximately 21.0%, which assumes an effective tax rate of 20.5% for net investment income and 21% for all other items; and \n  * Weighted average shares of 61.5 million on a fully diluted basis. \n\n\n\nThe supplemental investor package, with financial information not included in this press release, is available on the Investors page of Selective’s website at [www.Selective.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Selective.com&esheet=54139565&newsitemid=20241021614542&lan=en-US&anchor=www.Selective.com&index=1&md5=8eca4e22b2d3f101e548f8325943af04). \n\nSelective’s quarterly analyst conference call will be simulcast at 8:30 AM ET, on Tuesday, October 22, 2024, on [www.Selective.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Selective.com&esheet=54139565&newsitemid=20241021614542&lan=en-US&anchor=www.Selective.com&index=2&md5=c753179da373537cc56589057cce8c26).

Adjusted book value per common share differs from book value per common share by excluding total after-tax unrealized gains and losses on investments included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These non-GAAP measures are used as important financial measures by management, analysts, and investors, because the timing of realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on securities in any given period is largely discretionary. In addition, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments could distort the analysis of trends. These operating measurements are not intended to be a substitute for net income (loss) available to common stockholders, net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share, return on common equity, and book value per common share prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Reconciliations of net income (loss) available to common stockholders, net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share, return on common equity, and book value per common share to non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating income (loss) per diluted common share, non-GAAP operating return on common equity, and adjusted book value per common share, respectively, are provided in the tables below. \n\nNote: All amounts included in this release exclude intercompany transactions. \n\n**Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders to Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss)**\n\n_$ in millions_| **Quarter ended September 30,**| **Year-to-Date September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders |  $ |  90.0 |  86.9 |  104.6 |  233.5   \nNet realized and unrealized investment (gains) losses included in net income, before tax |  (5.4 |  ) |  6.9 |  (5.1 |  ) |  9.0   \nTax on reconciling items |  1.1 |  (1.4 |  ) |  1.1 |  (1.9 |  )   \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) |  $ |  85.7 |  92.3 |  100.6 |  240.6   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders per Diluted Common Share to Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) per Diluted Common Share**\n\n**Quarter ended September 30,**| **Year-to-Date September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share |  $ |  1.47 |  1.42 |  1.71 |  3.83   \nNet realized and unrealized investment (gains) losses included in net income, before tax |  (0.09 |  ) |  0.11 |  (0.08 |  ) |  0.15   \nTax on reconciling items |  0.02 |  (0.02 |  ) |  0.01 |  (0.03 |  )   \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) per diluted common share |  $ |  1.40 |  1.51 |  1.64 |  3.95   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Return on Common Equity to Non-GAAP Operating Return on Common Equity**\n\n**Quarter ended September 30,**| **Year-to-Date September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nReturn on Common Equity |  12.6 |  % |  14.1 |  5.0 |  12.8   \nNet realized and unrealized investment (gains) losses included in net income, before tax |  (0.8 |  ) |  1.1 |  (0.2 |  ) |  0.5   \nTax on reconciling items |  0.3 |  (0.2 |  ) |  — |  (0.1 |  )   \nNon-GAAP Operating Return on Common Equity |  12.1 |  % |  15.0 |  4.8 |  13.2   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Book Value per Common Share to Adjusted Book Value per Common Share**\n\n**Quarter ended September 30,**| **Year-to-Date September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nBook value per common share |  $ |  48.82 |  40.35 |  48.82 |  40.35   \nTotal unrealized investment (gains) losses included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, before tax |  2.50 |  10.38 |  2.50 |  10.38   \nTax on reconciling items |  (0.52 |  ) |  (2.19 |  ) |  (0.52 |  ) |  (2.19 |  )   \nAdjusted book value per common share |  $ |  50.80 |  48.54 |  50.80 |  48.54   \n  \nNote: Amounts in the tables above may not foot due to rounding. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements in this report, including information incorporated by reference, are “forward-looking statements” defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\").

However, should the highest courts determine otherwise, our loss and loss expenses may increase, our related reserves may not be adequate, and our financial condition and liquidity may be materially impacted. \n  * Ongoing wars and conflicts impacting global economic, banking, commodity, and financial markets, exacerbating ongoing economic challenges, including inflation and supply chain disruption, which influences insurance loss costs, premiums, and investment valuations; \n  * Uncertainties related to insurance premium rate increases and business retention; \n  * Changes in insurance regulations that impact our ability to write and/or cease writing insurance policies in one or more states; \n  * The effects of data privacy or cyber security laws and regulations on our operations; \n  * Major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems that result in harm to our brand in the marketplace, increased senior executive focus on crisis and reputational management issues, and/or increased expenses, particularly if we experience a significant privacy breach; \n  * Potential tax or federal financial regulatory reform provisions that could pose certain risks to our operations; \n  * Our ability to maintain favorable financial ratings, which may include sustainability considerations, from rating agencies, including AM Best, Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch; \n  * Our entry into new markets and businesses; and \n  * Other risks and uncertainties we identify in filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports. \n\n\n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241021614542r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241021614542/en/>\n\n**Investor Contact:** Brad B.
