(“Cyabra”), a provider of an AI-powered solution for combating worldwide disinformation, and Trailblazer Merger Corporation I (“Trailblazer”) (NASDAQ: TBMC), a special purpose acquisition company, announced today the signing of a definitive agreement for a business combination that upon closing is expected to result in Cyabra being publicly listed on the NASDAQ.\n\nThe spread of disinformation is one of the most pressing challenges facing society today, undermining trust in brands, individuals, communities, and democratic institutions. At a time when students are bullying their peers using AI generated fake content and automated distribution bots, nation states disseminate false narratives to impact public opinion on elections and military conflicts, and mega corporations spread misinformation about competitors, impacting tens of thousands of workers and shareholders for financial profit, Cyabra is on the front lines of this informational warfare, identifying illicit bot campaigns and providing tools to combat the bad actors in the ongoing fight to restore trust in the digital realm.\n\nDan Brahmy, CEO and co-founder of Cyabra stated, \"Our proprietary technology, developed by senior veterans from the Israeli special operations command (SOCOM), allows us to use sophisticated algorithms and advanced data analytics to determine when automated bots are being used to spread lies across social media platforms. We have corporate customers and governments worldwide using our product today to identify when an attack is occurring, providing them with the information needed to mitigate or even prevent any damage and protect their citizens and brands from the increasingly sophisticated spread of disinformation. \n\nMike Pompeo, Cyabra Board member and 70th United States Secretary of State commented, “Cyabra's efforts are not only safeguarding our digital realm, but also strengthening the foundations of free and fair discourse. Cyabra’s contributions are invaluable in the fight against malicious actors who seek to undermine our democratic institutions.\"\n\nArie Rabinowitz, CEO of Trailblazer stated, “It is becoming increasingly evident that the tremendous rise of social media in our daily lives has created a complex set of challenges. The proliferation of bad actors coupled with automated content creation and distribution tools that are easily accessible, including generative AI and bot accounts, has made the intentional dissemination of disinformation progressively worse. Cyabra presents a technology that governments, security agencies, and international enterprises are implementing to detect and monitor these threats. We are excited to present Cyabra to the public markets and look forward to supporting the Company’s growth.”\n\n**The Good, The Bad and The Fake Online** The World Economic Forum’s 2024 Global Risks Report identifies disinformation as the most significant short-term risk facing humanity. The economic impact alone is estimated to be $78 billion, according to a study conducted jointly by the University of Baltimore and CHEQ (a company specializing in cyber security).\n\nThe battle against misinformation has escalated to where 87% of executives say that the spread of disinformation is one of the most significant reputational risks to businesses today, according to Global Research. Gartner, a leading technology research firm, anticipates that by 2028, “enterprise spend on battling misinformation will surpass $30 billion annually, cannibalizing 10% of marketing and cybersecurity budgets to combat a multifront threat.”\n\n**Summary of Transaction** The transaction values Cyabra at a total enterprise value of $70 Million at signing. Upon the closing of the transaction, which is expected in the first quarter of 2025, the combined company will operate as Cyabra and will be listed on NASDAQ. \n\nThe transaction has been unanimously approved by each of Trailblazer’s and Cyabra’s Board of Directors. The proposed transaction is subject to the approval of Trailblazer and Cyabra stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions, including a registration statement being declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). \n\n**Advisors** LifeSci Capital is acting as financial advisor and Loeb & Loeb LLP is serving as legal advisor to Trailblazer Merger Corporation I. Lowenstein Sandler LLP and Goldfarb, Gross, Seligman & Co. are serving as legal advisors to Cyabra.\n\n**About Cyabra** Founded by veterans of elite Israeli intelligence units, Cyabra is a data intelligence company that is at the forefront of the fight against the online distribution of disinformation. Cyabra has developed a proprietary AI-powered system, trusted by large corporations, governments, and security agencies to uncover risks, attacks, and malicious activity on social media platforms.

          "content": "CODE OF ETHICS\nOF\nTRAILBLAZER MERGER CORPORATION I\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Trailblazer Merger Corporation I (the\n“Company”) has adopted this Code of Ethics (this “Code”) to provide value for our shareholders;\nand\n• To encourage honest and ethical conduct, including fair dealing and the ethical\nhandling of conflicts of interest;\n• To prompt full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure;\n• To comply with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;\n• To prompt internal reporting of violations of this Code;\n• To protect the Company’s legitimate business interests, including corporate\nopportunities, assets and confidential information; and\n• To deter wrongdoing.\nAll directors, officers, employees and independent contractors of the Company are\nexpected to be familiar with this Code and to adhere to the principles and procedures set forth in\nthis Code. For purposes of this Code, all directors, officers, employees and independent contractors\nare referred to collectively as “employees” or “you” throughout this Code.\nI. Honest and Ethical Conduct\nAll directors, officers, employees and independent contractors owe duties to the Company\nto act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and ethical. This includes\nthe ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional\nrelationships. Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.\nAll directors, officers, employees and independent contractors have the following duties:\n• To conduct business with professional courtesy and integrity, and act honestly and\nfairly without prejudice in all commercial dealings;\n• To work in a safe, healthy and efficient manner, using skills, time and experience\nto the maximum of abilities;\n• To comply with applicable Company policies and job requirements, and adhere to\na high standard of business ethics;\n• To observe both the form and spirit of laws, governmental rules, regulations and\naccounting standards;\n• Not to knowingly make any misleading statements to any person or to be a party to\nany improper practice in relation to dealings with or by the Company;\n• To ensure that Company resources and properties are used properly;\n• To maintain the confidentiality of information where required or consistent with\nCompany policies; and\n• Not to disclose information or documents relating to the Company or its business,\nother than as required by law, not to make any unauthorized public comment on\nCompany affairs and not to misuse any information about the Company or its\nassociates, and not to accept improper or undisclosed material personal benefits\nfrom third parties as a result of any transaction or transactions of the Company.\nII. Conflicts of Interest\nA “conflict of interest” arises when an individual’s personal interest interferes or appears\nto interfere with the interests of the Company. A conflict of interest can arise when a director,\nofficer or employee takes actions or has personal interests that may make it difficult to perform his\nor her Company work objectively and effectively.\nThere are a variety of situations in which a conflict of interest may arise. While it would\nbe impractical to attempt to list all possible situations, some common types of conflicts may be:\n• To serve as a director, employee or contractor for a company that has a business\nrelationship with, or is a competitor of the Company;\n• To have a financial interest in a competitor, supplier or customer of the Company;\n• To receive improper personal benefits from a competitor, supplier or customer, as\na result of any transaction or transactions of the Company;\n• To accept financial interest beyond entertainment or nominal gifts in the ordinary\ncourse of business, such as a meal or a coffee mug;\n• To present at a conference where the conference sponsor has a real or potential\nbusiness relationship with the Company (e.g. vendor, customer, or investor), and,\nthe conference sponsor offers travel or accommodation arrangements or other\nbenefits materially in excess of the Company’s standard; or\n• To use for personal gain, rather than for the benefit of the Company, an opportunity\nthat is offered to you solely in your capacity as an employee, officer or director of\nthe Company and that is one that the Company is legally and contractually\npermitted to undertake and that is otherwise reasonable for the Company to pursue.\nFidelity or service to the Company should never be subordinated to or dependent on\npersonal gain or advantage. Conflicts of interest should be avoided.\nIn most cases, anything that would constitute a conflict for a director, officer or employee\nalso would present a conflict if it is related to a member of his or her family.\nInterests in other companies, including potential competitors and suppliers, that are purely\nfor management of the other entity, or where an otherwise questionable relationship is disclosed\nto the Board and any necessary action is taken to ensure there will be no effect on the Company,\nare not considered conflicts unless otherwise determined by the Board.\nEvaluating whether a conflict of interest exists can be difficult and may involve a number\nof considerations. Please refer to other policies, such as the employee handbook, for further\ninformation. We also encourage you to seek guidance from the Chief Executive Officer or Chief\nFinancial Officer, or their equivalents, when you have any questions or doubts.\nIII. Related-Party Transactions\nThe Company shall avoid, wherever possible, all Related-Party Transactions (as defined\nbelow) that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except if in accordance with\nthe approval process and guidelines included below.\n“Related-Party Transactions” are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount\ninvolved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) the Company or\nany of the Company’s subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or\nnominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of the Company’s common\nstock, or (c) immediate family member of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b) (each, a\n“Related Party”), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result\nof being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity).\nApproval Process and Guidelines.\n• Each director and executive officer shall identify any Related-Party Transaction\ninvolving a Related Party and inform the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit\nCommittee”) before the Company may engage in the transaction with a Related\nParty. Each of the Company’s directors and officers shall complete a directors’ and\nofficers’ questionnaire that elicits information about Related-Party Transactions.\n• In the event that the Company proposes to enter into, or materially amend, a\nRelated-Party Transaction, the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer\nshall present such Related-Party Transaction to the Audit Committee for review\nand consideration. The presentation to the Audit Committee shall include, to the\nextent reasonably available, a description of (a) all of the parties thereto, (b) the\ninterests, direct or indirect, of any Related Party in the transaction in sufficient\ndetail so as to enable the Audit Committee to fully assess such interests, (c) a\ndescription of the purpose of the transaction, (d) all of the material facts of the\nproposed Related-Party Transaction, including the proposed aggregate value of\nsuch transaction, or, in the case of indebtedness, the amount of principal that would\nbe involved, (e) the benefits to the Company of the proposed Related-Party\nTransaction, (f) if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable\nproducts or services, (g) an assessment of whether the proposed Related-Party\nTransaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to or from, as the\ncase may be, unrelated third parties and (h) the recommendation of the Chief\nExecutive Officer or Chief Financial Officer with respect to the proposed Related-\nParty Transaction.\nA Related-Party Transaction shall require, by the Audit Committee and a majority\nof the Company’s disinterested and independent directors, or the members of the\nBoard who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access\nat the Company’s expense to the Company’s attorneys or independent legal\ncounsel, prior approval and a determination that the terms of such Related-Party\nTransaction are no less favorable to the Company than those that would be available\nto the Company with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.\n• Any Related-Party Transaction, if not a Related-Party Transaction when originally\nconsummated, or if not initially identified as a Related-Party Transaction prior to\nconsummation, shall be submitted to the Audit Committee and a majority of the\nCompany’s disinterested and independent directors for review and, if applicable,\napproved in accordance with the review and oversight policies set forth above as\nsoon as reasonably practicable.\n• Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not consummate its initial\nbusiness combination (a “Business Combination”) with an entity that is affiliated\nwith any of the Company’s sponsor, officers or directors, unless the Company, or\na committee of independent directors, has obtained an opinion from an independent\ninvestment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders\nvaluation opinions that the Business Combination is fair to the Company from a\nfinancial point of view.\n• In no event will the Company’s sponsor, officers or directors or any affiliate of the\nsponsor, officers or directors be paid any finder’s fees, reimbursements, consulting\nfee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation prior to, for\nservices rendered to the Company prior to, or in connection with any services\nrendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of the Company’s initial\nBusiness Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).\nIV. Disclosure\nEach director, officer or employee, to the extent involved in the Company’s disclosure\nprocess, including the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents (the\n“Senior Financial Officers”), is required to be familiar with the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures applicable to him or her so that the Company’s public reports and documents comply\nin all material respects with the applicable securities laws and rules. In addition, each such person\nhaving direct or supervisory authority regarding these securities filings or the Company’s other\npublic communications concerning its general business, results, financial condition and prospects\nshould, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of responsibility, consult with other\nCompany officers and employees and take other appropriate steps regarding these disclosures with\nthe goal of making full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure.\nEach director, officer or employee, to the extent involved in the Company’s disclosure process,\nincluding the Senior Financial Officers, must:\n• Familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements applicable to the\nCompany as well as the business and financial operations of the Company.\n• Not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the\nCompany to others, whether within or outside the Company, including to the\nCompany’s independent auditors, governmental regulators and self-regulatory\norganizations.\nV. Compliance\nIt is the Company’s policy to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. It is\nthe personal responsibility of each employee, officer and director to adhere to the standards and\nrestrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations in the performance of their duties for the\nCompany, including those relating to accounting and auditing matters and insider trading.\nThe Board endeavors to ensure that the directors, officers and employees of the Company\nact with integrity and observe the highest standards of behavior and business ethics in relation to\ntheir corporate activities.\nSpecifically, directors, officers and employees must:\n• Comply with the law;\n• Act in the best interests of the Company;\n• Be responsible and accountable for their actions; and\n• Observe the ethical principles of fairness, honesty and truthfulness, including\ndisclosure of potential conflicts.\nGenerally, it is against Company policies for any individual to profit from undisclosed\ninformation relating to the Company or any other company in violation of insider trading or other\nlaws. Anyone who is aware of material nonpublic information relating to the Company, our\ncustomers, or other companies may not use the information to purchase or sell securities in\nviolation of securities laws.\nIf you are uncertain about the legal rules involving your purchase or sale of any Company\nsecurities or any securities in companies that you are familiar with by virtue of your work for the\nCompany, you should consult with the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their\nequivalents, before making any such purchase or sale. Other policies issued by the Company also\nprovide guidance as to certain of the laws, rules and regulations that apply to the Company’s\nactivities.\nVI. Reporting and Accountability\nThe Board has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. Any director,\nofficer or employee who becomes aware of any violation of this Code is required to notify the\nChief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, promptly.\nAny questions relating to how these policies should be interpreted or applied should be\naddressed to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents. Any\nmaterial transaction or relationship that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of\ninterest, as discussed in Section II of this Code, should be discussed with the Chief Executive\nOfficer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents. A director, officer or employee who is\nunsure of whether a situation violates this Code should discuss the situation with the Chief\nExecutive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, to prevent possible\nmisunderstandings and embarrassment at a later date.\nEach director, officer or employee must:\n• Notify the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents,\npromptly of any existing or potential violation of this Code.\n• Not retaliate against any other director, officer or employee for reports of potential\nviolations.\nThe Company will follow the following procedures in investigating and enforcing this\nCode and in reporting on the Code:\n• The Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, as the\ncase may be, will take all appropriate action to investigate any violations reported.\nIn addition, the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their\nequivalents, as appropriate, shall report each violation and alleged violation\ninvolving a director or an executive officer to the Chairman of the Board. To the\nextent he or she deems appropriate, the Chairman of the Board shall participate in\nany investigation of a director or executive officer. After the conclusion of an\ninvestigation of a director or executive officer, the conclusions shall be reported to\nthe Board.\n• The Board will conduct such additional investigation as it deems necessary. The\nBoard will determine whether a director or executive officer has violated this Code.\nUpon being notified that a violation has occurred, the Chief Executive Officer or\nChief Financial Officer, or their equivalents, as the case may be, will take such\ndisciplinary or preventive action as deemed appropriate, up to and including\ndismissal or, in the event of criminal or other serious violations of law, notification\nof appropriate law enforcement authorities.\nVII. Corporate Opportunities\nEmployees, officers and directors are prohibited from taking (or directing to a third party)\na business opportunity that is offered to them solely in their capacity as an employee, officer or\ndirector of the Company and that is one that the Company is legally and contractually permitted\nto undertake and that is otherwise reasonable for the Company to pursue, unless the Company has\nalready been offered the opportunity and turned it down. More generally, employees, officers and\ndirectors are prohibited from using corporate property, information or position for personal gain\nand from competing with the Company.\nSometimes, the line between personal and Company benefits is difficult to draw, and\nsometimes there are both personal and Company benefits in certain activities. Employees, officers\nand directors who intend to make use of Company property or services in a manner not solely for\nthe benefit of the Company should consult beforehand with the Chief Executive Officer or Chief\nFinancial Officer, or their equivalents.\nVIII. Confidentiality\nIn carrying out the Company’s business, employees, officers and directors often learn\nconfidential or proprietary information about the Company, its customers, suppliers, or joint\nventure parties. Employees, officers and directors must maintain the confidentiality of all\ninformation so entrusted to them, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated.\nConfidential or proprietary information of our Company, and of other companies, includes any\nnon-public information that would be harmful to the relevant company or useful or helpful to\ncompetitors if disclosed.\nIX. Fair Dealing\nOur core value of operating is based on responsiveness, openness, honesty and trust with\nour members, business partners, employees and shareholders. We do not seek competitive\nadvantages through illegal or unethical business practices. Each employee, officer and director\nshould endeavor to deal fairly with the Company’s customers, service providers, suppliers,\ncompetitors and employees. No employee, officer or director should take unfair advantage of\nanyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of\nmaterial facts, or any unfair dealing practice.\nX. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nAll employees, officers and directors should protect the Company’s assets and ensure their\nefficient use. All Company assets should be used only for legitimate business purposes. Theft,\ncarelessness and waste have a direct impact on our profit.\nXI. Waivers and Amendments\nFrom time to time, the Company may waive provisions of this Code. Any employee or\ndirector who believes that a waiver may be called for should discuss the matter with the Chief\nExecutive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or their equivalents.\nAny waiver of the Code for executive officers (including Senior Financial Officers) or\ndirectors of the Company may be made only by the Board and must be promptly disclosed to\nshareholders along with the reasons for such waiver in a manner as required by applicable law or\nthe rules of the applicable stock exchange. Any amendment or waiver of any provision of this\nCode must be approved in writing by the Board or, if appropriate, its delegate(s) and promptly\ndisclosed pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.\nAny waiver or modification of the Code for a Senior Financial Officer will be promptly\ndisclosed to shareholders if and as required by applicable law or the rules of the applicable stock\nexchange.\nThe Company is committed to continuously reviewing and updating its policies, and\ntherefore reserves the right to amend this Code at any time, for any reason, subject to applicable\nlaw."
