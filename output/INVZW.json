I would like to welcome you to our Q3 2024 earnings conference call. Joining us\ntoday are Omer Keilaf, Chief Executive Officer; and Eldar Cegla, Chief Financial Officer.\n• I would like to remind everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available on the\nInvestor Relations section of our website at ir.innoviz.tech.\n• Before we begin, I would like to remind you that our discussion today will include forward-\nlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to future events and the\nfuture financial performance of Innoviz. Actual results could differ materially from those\nanticipated in the forward-looking statements.\n• Forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today, and we\nundertake no obligation to publicly update or revise them. For a discussion of some important\nrisk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking\nstatements, please see the risk factors section of our Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission on March 12, 2024.\n• Omer, please go ahead.\nSlide 3 – Our Vision\nSlide 4 – Q3 Highlights / Introduction (Omer)\n• Thank you, Maya, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us.\n• The third quarter represented another strong quarter for Innoviz both in terms of revenue and\ncash performance.\n• During the last quarter we announced a new partnership with a leading Level 4 platform partner,\ntoday I am happy to share that following this agreement we entered two new OEM programs\nwith expected SOP in 2026. I will share more detail on this momentarily.\n• Revenues for the quarter were $4.5 million, above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.5 to\n$5 million, we further decreased our cash used in operations and capital expenditures from\n$28.6 million in Q3 2023 by approximately 38% to $17.7 million this quarter. Both Eldar and I will\nprovide additional color on this later.\n• On today’s call I’ll begin the discussion by providing more details on our announcement of the 2\nnew OEMs, then we will discuss our progress regarding the different Volkswagen programs\n• I’ll then give an overview of our pipeline and highlight several of the programs we are competing\nfor. These are exciting programs with notable OEMs, and on some we are expecting nomination\ndecisions in the near term. I’ll provide some high-level detail on these and explain why we are\nconfident in our positioning.\n• We will also share with you exciting breakthroughs on the technological front. These\ndevelopments allow us to significantly improve our product’s performance in both range and\nresolution and also provide new and unique LiDAR capabilities which are valuable to our clients.\n• I’ll conclude the technical discussion with an update on our new short-range offering.\n• Finally, I’ll discuss our expectations for the rest of the year in addition to reviewing our Q3\nfinancials.\nSlide 5 – 2 OEMs Update\n• Starting with our announcement on the two new OEM programs. During the third quarter,\nfollowing our engagement with a major Level 4 platform partner, we entered two new OEM\nprograms which have adopted the platform to allow seamless integration of our LiDARs into\ntheir vehicles.\n• As part of this process, we are working with the platform partner and the OEMS on the\nmechanical, electrical and other integration aspects.\n• Innoviz is expected to provide a bundle of nine InnovizTwo short- and long-range LiDARs per\nvehicle. This is a testament to the business advantage of offering a bundle of both Short and\nLong Range LiDARs to our customers, which allows us to secure more meaningful revenues.\n• We expect to see fleets from both OEMs begin road testing in 2025, with Start of Production\nexpected in 2026.\n• These two OEMs are part of a group of additional OEMs that have already selected the platform.\nTherefore, we expect additional OEM programs in the future. Importantly, this partnership has\nthe potential to offer significant revenue growth and favorable volumes for Innoviz.\n• Just recently, we have heard of progress around some new and exciting customers who may\npotentially adopt the platform.\n• We’re excited to be a part of this platform and for the opportunities it could create for Innoviz.\nWe are aware of the market’s curiosity related to the names of the platform partner and the\nOEMs and we agreed with our partner to share more details before the end of the year.\nSlide 6 – Volkswagen\n• Moving on to an update on our partnership with Volkswagen.\n• As a reminder, we secured a series production award for different VW brands.\n• We are working on two Level 3 platforms, one with Qualcomm and Cariad and the other\ncombines Mobileye Chauffeur and Rivian software.\n• We also continue to work on the ID.Buzz light commercial vehicle program, a level 4 program\nwith multiple LiDARs per vehicle planned to launch in 2026. This program incorporates Mobileye\nDrive.\n• I’m happy to share that the development process is moving forward nicely across these\nprograms.\n• We continue to move through various audits and development gates successfully, both on the\nproduction line and other development aspects.\n• We are on track to meet the planned LiDAR start of production timelines.\nSlide 7 – MOIA\n• Just recently, MOIA, a Volkswagen Group technology company that develops on-demand ride\npooling services for urban areas, made an important announcement regarding the ID. Buzz.\n• MOIA announced that starting in mid-2025 it will deploy the ID. Buzz in Hamburg, Germany as\npart of project ALIKE, a project to test autonomous on-demand ridepooling in the city. This is in\naddition to its previous announcements regarding deployment also in Austin, Texas and in\nHanover Germany. We are happy to see this platform expanding and eager to learn about\nadditional locations around the world which will follow.\n• MOIA is offering its Mobility-as-a-service licensing model to cities all over the world, and its goal\nis to develop an autonomous ridepooling system that can be scaled internationally.\n• We are proud to be a part of the ID. Buzz program, which is supporting the evolution of mobility.\nSlide 8 – Pipeline\n• Now I’ll discuss our pipeline of RFIs and RFQs and provide additional detail on several specific\nRFQs in which we are making progress.\n• Overall, we currently have over 15 programs in the pipeline, with approximately 50% in the RFQ\nstage.\n• We’re encouraged by the continued progression of the opportunities in our pipeline and are\nconfident in our positioning to provide our LiDARs and perception software to the market.\n• While we are in contact with a number of OEMs regarding additional programs, I’ll speak today\nabout several specific opportunities we are working towards.\n• First, I’ll highlight a potential new level 3 program with a top ten automotive OEM that we are\nparticularly excited about.\n• We were able to demonstrate InnovizTwo’s performance advantages and maturity to the\npotential customer and are in the very late stages of the RFQ process with this meaningful OEM,\nreaching alignment on technical, production, commercial and legal matters. I am happy to also\nshare that we recently passed their exhaustive production audits, a major box to check in the\nRFQ process.\n• We are making solid progress, and they have indicated that they are nearly ready to make a\nnomination decision.\n• We’re looking forward to hearing their decision soon.\nSlide 9 – North American OEMs / Pipeline Update\n• Importantly, we are seeing a pickup in potential customer activity in the North America region in\nboth Level 3 and Level 4.\n• As such, we are in contact with several leading North American automotive OEMs regarding\nvarious RFIs and RFQs, including Level 3 and Level 4 programs.\nAcross theses OEMs, we’ve successfully completed LiDAR technical and commercial assessments\nwhich allowed us to display the advantages of our technology.\n• As a result, we are now in various stages of sourcing processes.\n• We expect to start hearing back from the OEMs regarding the kickoff of these programs in the\ncoming months.\n• The opportunities I’ve just discussed are among the many in our diverse pipeline.\n• We have a lot to look forward to, and the entire team is working hard to convert these\nopportunities into additional design wins.\nSlide 10 - Technology Update Intro\n• Now turning to an overview of some exciting breakthroughs on the technological front.\n• More and more, we are seeing our unique technology as a primary competitive advantage. We\nare as confident as ever that we are positioned to win many more customer programs thanks to\nthe value our outstanding technology offers to our clients.\n• Innoviz is not the first or oldest LiDAR company, yet we’ve become a trailblazer in the industry\nsince we were founded. Today, it seems from the feedback that we are receiving from our\ncustomers, that our technology significantly outpaces the LiDAR market, and we believe that this\ngap will continue to widen.\n• There are several reasons to support this claim. First and foremost, we have the track record and\nculture to push boundaries and never assume there is a limit to what we can do. Impossible is\nnot in our vocabulary.\n• This has translated to tangible results, which I will touch on in the following slides. These include\nour new and improved InnovizTwo configuration, a unique IR imaging offering, unparalleled\nblockage resilience, and the first samples of the InnovizTwo short-range LiDAR for Level 4 and\nnon-automotive applications.\nSlide 11 – New InnovizTwo\n• At Innoviz, we continuously advance our technology – we are always striving to push\nperformance boundaries to enhance quality for our customers.\n• In that spirit, we have again improved the InnovizTwo with a new and more advanced\nconfiguration.\n• Some key features include a new uniform resolution of 0.05 x 0.05 degrees across the field of\nview resulting in approximately 12 megapixels per second along with an improved range.\n• We’re proud to have upgraded our technology again and offer additional performance\nadvantages contributing to a better driving experience.\nSlide 12 – “All in One” LiDAR and IR Camera\n• Another exciting development which is now offered to our customers is a new feature which\nallows capturing in-LiDAR IR imaging that can capture scenes with views of few kilometers very\nmuch like a camera. That will allow us to see not only point clouds but actual clouds in the sky…\n• With this technology, our LiDAR has the unique ability to provide camera-like image output that\ncan be provided alongside our 3-D point cloud data at the same resolution. This allows an\nimproved low-level fusion of both a 3-D and camera-like image, which enables low-level fusion\nperception stack that exceeds the capabilities of existing LiDAR perception solutions. As you can\nsee in the video, this allows for an “all in one” LiDAR plus IR camera, using the same hardware.\n• This creates lower power usage and higher performance – all at a lower cost to the customer.\nSlide 13 - Blockages\n• With all of these technological advances, we have delivered yet another key differentiating\nadvantage, which is InnovizTwo’s resilience to various types of blockages, including mud, dust,\nwater, stone chipping and insects.\n• This resilience mitigates the potential for compromised object detection and tracking, and for\nautonomous driving disengagements.\n• In the videos that you are seeing, you will notice that the LiDAR window is heavily covered with\nmud which normally would create blockages that translate into gaps or holes in the field of view\nin any standard Lidar or Camera. As you can see, no such holes are observed in the InnovizTwo\npoint cloud or IR image thanks to our technological solution to the blockage problem.\n• This is a critical advantage, especially for Level 4 applications. Our product delivers continuous\navailability, allowing the vehicle to reliably detect obstacles, pedestrians, and changes in the\ndriving environment, ultimately minimizing the risk of collisions.\n• This becomes crucial as we work with OEMs across autonomy levels, including working up to\nlevel 4. Let me explain…\nSlide 14 – Advantages for Level 4\n• Level 2 applications require full driver supervision, hence the reduced sensitivity to blockages.\nWhen working with Level 3 applications, the driver is allowed to take their eyes off of the road.\nIn Level 3 you need to have redundancy, but even then, the driver might be required to regain\ncontrol of the vehicle within 10 seconds, if needed.\n• A high quality, resilient LiDAR sensor contributes to a robust system that allows higher\navailability and creates a better autonomous driving experience by allowing the driver to relax\nfor longer periods without interruption.\n• With Level 4, the technology needs to be several magnitudes better because there is no driver to\nturn to - there is no 10 seconds grace period.\n• Because of that, we’re past the point of talking about just range and resolution. We’re talking\nabout quality and availability – our technology needs to be immune to blockages and adverse\ndriving conditions that might arise on the road.\n• The ability to operate seamlessly under these conditions is baked into the foundations of our\ntechnology, our designs and our architectures.\nSlide 15 – Short Range\n• Last technical update for today is related to our offering of a short-range version of the\nInnovizTwo.\n• The short-range LiDARs can be implemented across Level 4 automotive and non-automotive\napplications. Its features include resilience to sunlight and adverse weather conditions, up to\n100 meters of detection range, an up-to 90-degree vertical field of view and embedded\nautomotive cybersecurity.\n• These are just several of the many features that contribute to InnovizTwo short-range’s unique\nadvantages.\n• Following the development of this differentiated technology, we have seen increased interest in\nour short-range offering from customers, including interest in bundling this solution with our\nlong-range LiDAR, such as presented in today’s announcement.\nSlide 16 - Cost Reductions\n• I’d now like to take a moment to highlight our effective cash performance, which in tandem with\nour strong revenues, has led to sequentially decreased cash burn.\n• We are seeing benefits from the cost actions we executed as part of the strategic realignment\nwe announced in Q1.\n• Last year, our organizational structure comprised separate hardware and software development\nunits supporting both the InnovizOne and InnovizTwo platforms, meaning we had separate cost\nstructures for each platform.\n• We combined these units into one consolidated R&D department, and after moving InnovizOne\ninto series production we are solely focused on the InnovizTwo platform.\n• Notably, we are leveraging technological similarities between InnovizOne and InnovizTwo to\nfurther manage costs. For example, we invested in developing a second-generation high-quality\nASIC chip, meaning we have no need for additional investments in that component in the coming\nyears.\n• The realignment that we did earlier this year enabled us to realize and benefit from these\ntechnological carryovers, optimized workflows and processes, and a reorganized structure. We\nare on track to achieve the originally projected financial benefits of the realignment, and as a\nresult, we are now better positioned for rapid transformative growth with a larger number of\ncustomers.\n• Importantly, we are further offsetting our spending by consistently achieving revenues above or\nin line with our guidance.\nSlide 17 - Full Year Guidance\n• Before I hand the call over to Eldar, I’ll provide our revenue guidance for the full year.\n• We expect full year revenue in the range of $23.5 – $25 million, compared to $20.9 million in Full\nyear 2023.\n• I’d like to call out that the lumpiness we are seeing in revenues can be attributed to the cadence\nof NREs, channel fill and customer activity.\n• Last quarter, we reiterated our confidence in achieving our operational targets of two to three\nadditional programs from both existing and new customers, and $20 million to $70 million of\nnew NRE bookings in 2024.\n• I’m pleased to share that we’ve already met our operational target of adding 2 to 3 new\nprograms in 2024. This was achieved through the addition of the 2 new OEMs in connection with\nthe collaboration with a leading Level 4 platform partner, which is offering its solution together\nwith Innoviz’s LiDARs to several programs. In addition, there are two additional programs that\nwe started working on this year, which are pending finalizing the commercial and legal terms, on\ntop of these 2 OEMs.\n• Given the developments with our customers and continued strong performance in Q3, we also\nremain confident in achieving $20 - $70 million in NRE bookings and reiterate that target.\n• Looking ahead to 2025, we expect accelerate our revenue streams and build on our topline\nmomentum as more customers adopt our technology.\n• And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Eldar to review our Q3 2024 financials.\nSlide 18 - Financials Breaker (Eldar)\n• Thank you, Omer, and good morning, everyone.\nSlide 19 - Financials (Eldar)\n• Starting with cash, we ended Q3 2024 with approximately $87.7 million in cash and cash\nequivalents, bank deposits, marketable securities and short-term restricted cash on the balance\nsheet.\n• Cash used in operations and capital expenditures came in at $17.7 million compared to $28.6\nmillion in Q3 '23 and $21.6 million last quarter.\n• We’re continuing to drive sequentially decreased cash burn, resulting from our focus on the\nInnovizTwo platform and our strong revenue performance.\n• As Omer mentioned, we are realizing the benefits of our strategic realignment. Having reduced\ninvestments in InnovizOne development, our organization is leaner, more agile and entirely\nfocused on one platform with InnovizTwo.\n• I’m pleased to share that we are on track to achieve the expected savings from the realignment,\nreinforcing Innoviz’s history of financial execution.\n• We’re very proud of the trend of consistent improvement in cash burn that we’ve delivered over\nthe course of the year. While there may be continued lumpiness on a sequential basis, on a full\nyear basis, we expect to see lower overall burn in Full Year 2024 than we saw in Full Year 2023.\n• Looking into 2025 and beyond, we remain confident in our ability to manage our expenses\neffectively and keep our burn down on an annualized basis.\n• Gross margins continued to improve quarter over quarter. Going forward, we expect margins will\ncontinue to be lumpy as we ramp up the InnovizTwo platform, as unit volumes fluctuate and NRE\nrevenues continue to vary from quarter to quarter.\n• Now turning to the income statement. Revenues for Q3 were $4.5 million, compared to $3.5\nmillion in Q3 of 2023, and in line with our guidance range of $3.5 to $5 million. This represents\nanother quarter in which we have delivered on the topline, extending our record of strong\nrevenue execution.\n• Our operating expenses for Q3 2024 were $26 million, a decrease of 6.4% from $27.8 million in\nQ3 2023. This quarter's operating expenses included $4.2 million of share-based compensation\ncompared to $5.0 million in Q3 2023.\n• Research and development expenses for Q3 2024 were $19.7 million, a decrease from $20.7\nmillion in Q3 2023. The quarter's R&D expenses included $3 million of share-based\ncompensation compared to $3.1 million in Q3 2023.\n• To conclude, the third quarter represented another quarter of solid performance from both a\nrevenue and cash perspective. We’re encouraged by the ongoing strength of our expense\nmanagement and ability to consistently meet or exceed our revenue guidance. Looking into Q4,\nwe expect a strong finish to the year in which we maintain lower burn while further ramping up\nInnovizTwo and working to secure additional design wins.\n• With that, I’ll turn the call back to Omer for a few closing remarks.\nSlide 19 - Key Takeaways / Conclusion (Omer)\n• Thank you, Eldar.\n• Before I wrap up the call and open for Q&A, I wanted to remind you all in January we will be\nback at CES in Las Vegas providing a closer look at our recent technological advances for the CES\ncommunity and touching base with numerous customers and suppliers.\n• I hope to see some of you there.\n• In conclusion, Q3 was another strong quarter for Innoviz in terms of revenue performance, cost\ndiscipline, advancing customer relationships and further developing our technology.\n• We were happy to add two new OEMs through our partnership with the level 4 platform partner,\nwho we are collaborating with to bring our solutions to market. We are excited to see the first\ntest vehicles on the road in 2025, and look forward to the expected launch in 2026.\n• An increased number of OEM customers supports our revenue growth in the short and long\nterm through NRE bookings, samples and production units sales meanwhile continuing to build\nthe momentum of securing additional new OEMS.\n• We see this collaboration as potentially very valuable and we expect to continue to grow the\npartnership with additional OEMs. We hope to share more information on this by the end of the\nyear.\n• Our work with Volkswagen continues without delay, we are meeting deadlines and delivering\nhigh quality products to the programs, and we are optimistic about the opportunity to expand\nthe relationship with this key customer.\n• Across the board, we deepened our relationships with our customers and we believe that our\nnext few wins are within reach. Our pipeline remains robust and we are working to further\nadvance our RFIs and RFQs.\n• Heading into next year, as we add additional programs we expect to enhance our revenue\nstreams and reinforce our record of strong topline performance.\n• Our superior technology, balance sheet, and favorable external market factors, give us\nconfidence we can achieve our goal to become the leading tier 1 automotive LiDAR supplier.\n• And with that operator, please open up the call for Q&A.\nConclusion after Q&A (Omer)\n• Thanks again to everyone for joining us this morning. We hope to see you at CES and look\nforward to updating you next quarter on the continued progress we are making here at Innoviz."

Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial\nmay also impair our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price\nand value of our ordinary shares could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking\nstatements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors,\nincluding the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of certain, but not all, of the risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. If any of the risks actually occur, our\nbusiness could be materially impaired, the trading price of our ordinary shares and warrants could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n• Our limited operating history and evolving business model makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of your investment.\n• Continued pricing pressures, automotive OEM cost reduction initiatives and the ability of automotive OEMs to re-source or cancel vehicle or technology programs may\nresult in lower than anticipated margins, or in incremental losses, which may adversely affect our business.\n• We are creating innovative technologies by designing and developing unique components. The high price of, or low yield in these components, may affect our ability to\nsell at competitive prices or may lead to losses.\n• There are significant risks to providing our products as a direct supplier to customers, including additional operating costs, increased liabilities, and additional\nindemnification responsibilities, in each case, that we did not previously face when acting as a Tier-2 supplier.\n• We expect to invest substantially in research and development for the purpose of developing and commercializing new products. These investments could significantly\nreduce our profitability or increase our losses and may not generate revenue for us.\n• We will likely need to raise additional funds in the future in order to execute our business plan and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we\ncannot raise additional funds when we need them, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.\n• We may experience significant delays in the design, production and launch of our LiDAR products, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results.\n3\n• We are substantially dependent on a limited number of customers. The automotive industry is comprised of a relatively small number of players, which makes each\ndesign win material for us, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if any of our customers terminate our programs following such wins.\n• Designing and manufacturing LiDARs and LiDAR components on a mass-production scale requires meeting stringent quality requirements and we may face significant\nchallenges and complexities in this process.\n• The period of time from a design win to implementation is long and we are subject to the risk of cancellations or postponement of contracts or failure to successfully\nmeet customers’ requirements for SOP.\n• If market adoption of LiDAR for autonomous vehicles does not continue to develop, or develops more slowly than we expect, our business will be adversely affected.\n• Certain of our strategic, development and supply arrangements could be terminated or may not materialize into long-term contract partnership arrangements.\n• We target many customers that are large companies with substantial negotiating power, exacting product standards and potentially competitive internal solutions. If we\nare unable to sell our products to these customers, our prospects and results of operations will be adversely affected.\n• We continue to implement strategic initiatives designed to grow our business. These initiatives may prove more costly than we currently anticipate, and we may not\nsucceed in increasing our revenues by an amount sufficient to offset the costs of these initiatives and to achieve and maintain profitability.\n• The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, which requires us to continue to develop new products and product innovations and\ncould adversely affect market adoption of our products.\n• Certain of our strategic, development and supply arrangements could be terminated or may not materialize into long-term contract partnership arrangements.\n• Adoption of LiDAR for other emerging markets may not occur or may occur much more slowly than we anticipate, which would adversely affect our business and\nprospects.\n• Adverse conditions in the automotive industry or the global economy more generally could have adverse effects on our results of operations.\n• We may experience difficulties in expanding our operations.\n• As part of growing our business, we may in the future make acquisitions. If we fail to successfully select, execute or integrate our acquisitions, then our business, results\nof operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and the price of our ordinary shares and warrants could decline.\n• The first vehicles deploying our LiDAR technology and software are expected to become commercially available to end users in 2024. If any vehicles deploying our\nLiDAR technology and software are involved in traffic accidents or collisions actually or allegedly resulting from undetected defects, errors, or bugs in our products, or\nif our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, we may be exposed to product liability, warranty and other claims, in addition to a decline in the market\nadoption of our products, damage to our reputation with current or prospective customers, or increased regulatory scrutiny of our solutions which would adversely affect\nour operating costs, business and prospects.\n• We operate in a highly competitive market against a large number of both established competitors and new market entrants, and some market participants have\nsubstantially greater resources than ours.\n• We rely on third-party suppliers and are susceptible to supply shortages, long lead times for components and supply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply\nchain and could delay deliveries of our products to customers.\n• Our sales and operations in international markets expose us to operational, financial and regulatory risks.\n• We may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized parties from copying or reverse engineering our solutions.\nOur efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and prevent third parties from violating our rights may be costly.\n• Our business may be adversely affected by changes in automotive safety regulations or concerns that drive further regulation of the automobile safety market.\n4\n• Failures, or perceived failures, to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security requirements in the variety of jurisdictions in which we operate, may\nadversely impact our business, and such legal requirements are evolving, uncertain and may require improvements in, or changes to, our policies and operations.\n• As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to\nmaintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our ordinary shares.\n• The market price and trading volume of our ordinary shares and warrants may be volatile and could decline significantly.\n• We expect our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which could cause the price of our ordinary shares and warrants to fluctuate or decline.\n• We may lose our “foreign private issuer” status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses.\n• As we are a “foreign private issuer” and follow certain home country corporate governance practices, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to\nshareholders of companies that are subject to all corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).\n• The war in Israel and other conditions in Israel could materially and adversely affect our business.\n• The tax benefits that are available to us require that we continue to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which could increase our\ncosts and taxes.\n• The rights and responsibilities of our shareholders are governed by Israeli law, which may differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders of\nU.S. corporations.\nThe other matters described in this section titled “Risk Factors”.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur limited operating history and evolving business model makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of your investment.\nOur company has been focused on developing LiDAR products, components, and software for autonomous driving systems since our inception in 2016. This relatively limited\noperating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Further, because we have limited historical financial data and we\noperate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated\nin a more predictable market. In addition, our business model may evolve, which could render our historical operating history and financial data less useful in assessing our prospects.\nFor example, in addition to our traditional model of selling LiDAR systems directly to customers, we are currently selling a chipset containing components to Magna Electronics Inc.\n(“Magna”), which then assembles the LiDAR system for one of our customers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. We have encountered in the past, and we will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies\nwith limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect\nor change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our revenue may be adversely affected for a number of reasons, including the development and/or market acceptance of new technology that competes with our\nLiDAR products, changes by OEMs or other market participants to their autonomous vehicle technology, failure of our customers to commercialize autonomous systems that include\nour LiDAR solutions, our inability to effectively manage our inventory or manufacture products at scale, our failure to enter new markets or to attract new customers or expand\norders from existing customers, or due to increasing competition. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our target markets, customer demand for our\nproducts, commercialization timelines, developments in autonomous sensing and related technology, the success of existing competitive products and services, or the entry of new\ncompetitive companies and products. Accordingly, we do not expect to achieve profitability over the near term. If our revenue does not grow over the long term, our ability to achieve\nand maintain profitability may be adversely affected, and the value of our business may significantly decrease.\n5\nContinued pricing pressures, automotive OEM cost reduction initiatives and the ability of automotive OEMs to re-source or cancel vehicle or technology programs may\nresult in lower than anticipated margins, or in incremental losses, which may adversely affect our business.\nCost-cutting initiatives adopted by our customers often result in increased downward pressure on pricing. We expect that our agreements with automotive OEMs may require\nstep-downs in pricing over the term of the agreements or, if commercialized, over the periods of production. In addition, our automotive OEM customers often reserve the right to\nterminate their supply contracts for convenience, which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions. Automotive OEMs possess significant leverage over their suppliers,\nincluding us, because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive, serves a limited number of customers and has a high fixed cost base. Accordingly, we expect\nto be subject to substantial continuing pressure from automotive OEMs to reduce the price of our products. It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could\nintensify as our customers pursue restructuring, consolidation and cost-cutting initiatives. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price\nreductions, our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected.\nWe are creating innovative technologies by designing and developing unique components. The high price of, or low yield in these components, may affect our ability to sell\nat competitive prices or may lead to losses.\nPart of our technological approach to providing cost-efficient LiDAR-based autonomous driving solutions featuring superior performance involves using a multi-disciplinary\napproach to design some of our components. Many of these components are complex and contain multiple sophisticated elements. Volume production of these elements may require\nextreme precision and present challenges to their manufacturers. This can lead to increased costs of production of the components which the manufacturers may pass on to us, or a\nproduction run may yield fewer usable components than desired or anticipated. Any such increased components cost or suboptimal yield in the production of our components may\nsignificantly increase our production costs and thereby decrease our margins and potentially cause us losses.\nThere are significant risks to providing our products as a direct supplier to customers, including additional operating costs, increased liabilities, and additional\nindemnification responsibilities, in each case, that we did not previously face when acting as a Tier-2 supplier.\nWe are leveraging our in-house knowledge developed via our engagement and development history, to approach and to supply customers directly. This approach means\nentering into direct agreements with customers and not having a Tier-1 “middleman” to take on some of the risks involved in such long-term engagements. These risks include the\nresponsibilities associated with interacting directly with customers on complex tasks such as full design validation, direct customer support and vehicle integration. Each of these\nresponsibilities includes additional operating costs, increased liabilities, and additional indemnification responsibilities that we did not previously face when using a Tier-1\n“middleman”. In addition, conflicts may arise when we compete with our existing customers for business as a Tier-1 supplier and this competition may adversely affect our existing\nbusiness relationships with these other Tier-1s. Furthermore, as a Tier-1 supplier we are competing directly with more-established Tier-1s that have existing agreements and\nrelationships with the automotive OEMs, which may provide them certain advantages as compared to us.\nWe expect to invest substantially in research and development for the purpose of developing and commercializing new products. These investments could significantly\nreduce our profitability or increase our losses and may not generate revenue for us.\nOur future growth depends on maintaining our technological leadership in order to introduce new products that penetrate new markets and achieve market acceptance. We\ntherefore plan to incur substantial research and development costs as part of our efforts to design, develop, manufacture, and commercialize new products and enhance existing\nproducts. Our research and development expenses were approximately $92.7 million, $95.1 million and $93.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Future research and development expenses may adversely affect the future results of our operations. In addition, our research and development program may not\nproduce successful results, and even if it does successfully produce new products, those products may not achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue or become profitable.\n6\nWe will likely need to raise additional funds in the future in order to execute our business plan and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we cannot\nraise additional funds when we need them, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.\nWe will likely require additional capital in the future in order to fund our growth strategy or to respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics or technologies,\ncustomer demands, business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances. We may also determine to raise equity or debt financing for other reasons. For\nexample, in order to further enhance business relationships with current or potential customers or partners, we may issue equity or equity-linked securities to such current or potential\ncustomers or partners.\nWe may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible\ndebt or other equity-linked securities, our existing shareholders could experience significant dilution. In addition, any debt financing obtained by us in the future, whether in the form\nof a credit facility or otherwise, could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Further, Moody's decision in February 2024 to downgrade Israel’s\ncredit rating from A1 to A2, and to lower Israel’s credit outlook from stable to negative, may also make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future. If we are\nunable to obtain adequate financing or to obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to\nbusiness challenges could be significantly limited. In addition, because our decision to issue debt or equity in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond\nour control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts.\nWe may experience significant delays in the design, production and launch of our LiDAR products, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results.\nSome of our products are still in the development phase. Any delay in the design, production and commercial release of such products or of any other future products, could\nmaterially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. There are often delays in the design, production and commercial release of new products.\nTo the extent we delay the launch of any future product, our growth prospects could be adversely affected as we may fail to increase our market share.\nMoreover, our products are technologically complex and require high standards to manufacture. In addition, our products require extensive and lengthy testing and validation\ncycles, particularly in connection with our sensors and software, to ensure safety of the autonomous systems prior to commercial deployment. We have experienced in the past and\nwill likely experience in the future, defects, errors or bugs at various stages of development and manufacturing. We may be unable to timely release new products, manufacture\nexisting products, correct problems that have arisen or correct such problems to our customers’ satisfaction. Such delays could damage our relationships with customers and lead\nthem to seek alternative sources of supply. In addition, we could face material legal claims for breach of contract or tort as a result of such delays. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of\nits merit, could be costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely affect the market’s perception of us and our ability to deliver and our reliability. Further, our business\nliability insurance coverage could prove inadequate with respect to a claim, and future coverage may be unavailable, on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe are substantially dependent on a limited number of customers. The automotive industry is comprised of a relatively small number of players, which makes each design\nwin material for us, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if any of our customers terminate our programs following such wins.\nHistorically, our business was substantially dependent on our design win with BMW. We are the supplier of LiDAR technology and software technology to the BMW Level 3\nprogram (“BMW L3 Program”), through our Tier-1 partner, Magna. In the future, we anticipate that our business will be substantially dependent on our design wins with Cariad SE\nfor the Volkswagen brands (“Volkswagen”).\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our relationship with our customers and secure orders from them or that our design wins will result in increased\nrevenues or profitability. If major customers terminate or significantly alter or delay our programs with them and/or alter their respective relationships with us in an adverse manner,\nour business would be materially and adversely affected.\nDesigning and manufacturing LiDARs and LiDAR components on a mass-production scale requires meeting stringent quality requirements and we may face significant\nchallenges and complexities in this process.\nIn 2023, Magna began the series-production manufacturing of our LiDARs in connection with the BMW L3 Program. We expect in the future to begin manufacturing LiDARs\nas a Tier-1 direct supplier on a mass-production scale in connection with our other design win programs. The design and manufacturing of LiDARs on a mass-production scale\nrequires us to meet stringent quality requirements and obtain various certifications. To date, we have not manufactured LiDARs on a mass-production scale in connection with any of\nour programs, and we expect to face significant challenges and complexities which we will need to resolve expeditiously while continuing to develop new products. For example,\nsince manufacturing LiDARs requires investing significant capital expense in complex and unique machinery, unexpected malfunctions of such machinery could affect our\noperational efficiency and may result in loss of production equipment. In addition, we may face various unexpected operational risks such as damage to production facilities, delays,\nenvironmental damage, and potential legal liabilities. As a result of these challenges and risks, we may not be able to manufacture LiDARs on a mass-production scale without delays\nor unexpected costs, among other factors, which could adversely affect our business.\n7\nThe period of time from a design win to implementation is long and we are subject to the risk of cancellations or postponement of contracts, or failure to successfully meet\ncustomers’ requirements for SOP.\nProspective customers, including those in the automotive industry, generally must make significant commitments of resources to test and validate our products and confirm that\nthey can integrate with other technologies before including them in any particular system, product or model. The development cycles of our products with new customers varies\nwidely depending on the application, market, customer and the complexity of the product. In the automotive market, for example, this development cycle can be four to five years or\nmore. As a result of these lengthy development cycles, we spend significant time and resources to have our products selected by automotive OEMs and their suppliers for use in a\nparticular vehicle model, which is known as a design win or nomination. If we do not achieve a design win with respect to a particular vehicle model, we may not have an\nopportunity to supply our products to the automotive OEM for that vehicle model for a period of many years. If our products are not selected by an automotive OEM or its suppliers\nfor one vehicle model or if our products are not successful in that vehicle model, it is unlikely that our products will be deployed in other vehicle models of that automotive OEM.\nFurther, we are subject to the risk that customers might cancel or postpone either the entire program or the implementation of our technology, as well as the risk that we will not be\nable to integrate our hardware and software technologies successfully into a larger system with other sensing modalities. If we fail to win a significant number of vehicle model\nprograms from one or more of automotive OEMs or their suppliers, or our customers cancel or postpone implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition\nmay be materially and adversely affected.\nIf market adoption of LiDAR for autonomous vehicles does not continue to develop, or develops more slowly than we expect, our business will be adversely affected.\nWhile our LiDAR-based solutions are applied to different use cases across end markets, we have been and expect to continue to be focused on automotive applications. Despite\nthe fact that the automotive industry has engaged in considerable effort to research and test LiDAR products for advanced driver assistance systems (“ADAS”) and autonomous\ndriving applications, there is no guarantee that the automotive industry will continue to introduce LiDAR products in commercially available vehicles in the near future. LiDAR\nproducts are still relatively new to the market and it is possible that other sensor technologies and devices, based on new or existing technology or a combination of technologies, will\nachieve acceptance or leadership in the ADAS and autonomous driving industries. Even if LiDAR products are used in initial generations of autonomous driving or ADAS\ntechnology, we cannot guarantee that LiDAR products will be designed into or included in subsequent generations of such commercialized technology. The speed of market growth\nfor ADAS or autonomous vehicles is difficult, if not impossible, to predict, and it is more difficult to predict such market’s future growth in light of the economic consequences of,\namong other things, the increasing inflation and interest rates in the U.S. and globally, and the Ukraine-Russia war. In addition, to the extent that the market for autonomous vehicles\ndevelops successfully, we expect that there will be increasing competition from providers of sensing technology based on LiDAR and other modalities. If commercialization of\nLiDAR products is not successful, or not as successful as we expect or the market expects, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely\naffected. If other sensing modalities are to be preferred over our LiDAR product by either developers of autonomous driving systems or ADAS, OEMs, regulators, safety\norganizations or other market participants by the time autonomous vehicle technology achieves mass market adoption, our business, results of operations and financial condition will\nbe materially and adversely affected.\nWe target many customers that are large companies with substantial negotiating power, exacting product standards and potentially competitive internal solutions. If we are\nunable to sell our products to these customers, our prospects and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nMany of our customers and potential customers are large, multinational companies with substantial negotiating power relative to us and, in some instances, they may even have\ninternal solutions that are competitive to our products. These large, multinational companies also have significant resources, which may allow them to acquire or develop competitive\ntechnologies either independently or in partnership with others. Accordingly, even after investing significant resources to develop a product, we may not secure a design win or may\nnot be able to commercialize a product on profitable terms because, among other things, these companies have extremely strong negotiation positions to demand terms that are\nbeneficial for them, including reduced prices. If our products are not selected by these companies or if these companies develop or acquire competitive technology or negotiate terms\nthat are disadvantageous to us, it will have an adverse effect on our business.\n8\nWe continue to implement strategic initiatives designed to grow our business. These initiatives may prove more costly than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed\nin increasing our revenues by an amount sufficient to offset the costs of these initiatives and to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe continue to make investments and implement initiatives designed to grow our business, including:\n• investing in research and development;\n• attracting and retaining talent to develop, support and promote our business across different functions and geographies, further enhancing our manufacturing\nprocesses and partnerships; and\n• investing in legal, accounting and other administrative functions necessary to support our operations as a public company.\nThese initiatives may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue, if at all, in an amount sufficient to offset these\nhigher expenses and to achieve and maintain profitability. The market opportunities we are pursuing are at an early stage of development, and it may be many years before the\nmarkets we expect to serve generate significant demand for our products, if at all.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, which requires us to continue to develop new products and product innovations and\ncould adversely affect market adoption of our products.\nWhile we intend to invest substantial resources in research and development, continuing technological changes in sensing technology, as well as changes in the ADAS and\nautonomous driving industries, could adversely affect adoption of LiDAR and/or our products. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce a variety of\nnew capabilities and innovations to our existing product offerings, as well as to introduce a variety of new product offerings to address the changing needs of the markets in which we\noffer our products. We cannot guarantee that our new products will be released in a timely manner, or at all, or achieve market acceptance. In addition, we may in the future need to\nmake strategic decisions to account for low market acceptance. These actions and any similar future actions may materially and adversely affect our business and results of\noperations. Delays in delivering new products that meet customer requirements could damage our relationships with customers and lead them to seek alternative sources of supply.\nIf we are unable to devote adequate resources to develop and improve our products or cannot otherwise successfully develop products or system configurations that meet\ncustomer requirements, including pricing, on a timely basis or that remain competitive with other technological alternatives, our products could lose market share, our revenue will\ndecline, we may experience operating losses and our business and prospects will be adversely affected.\nCertain of our strategic, development and supply arrangements could be terminated or may not materialize into long-term contract partnership arrangements.\nWe have arrangements with strategic, development and supply partners and collaborators. Some of these arrangements are evidenced by memorandums of understandings,\nearly-stage agreements that are used for design and development purposes that will require renegotiation at later stages of development or replacement by production or master\nagreements under separately negotiated statements of work, each of which could be terminated or may not materialize into next-stage contracts or long-term contract partnership\narrangements. If these arrangements are terminated or if we are unable to enter into next-stage contracts or long-term operational contracts, our business, prospects, financial\ncondition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nAdoption of LiDAR for other emerging markets may not occur or may occur much more slowly than we anticipate, which would adversely affect our business and\nprospects.\nWe are investing in and pursuing market opportunities outside of passenger cars and the light commercial vehicle markets, such as trucking, robotaxis and shuttles. Each of\nthese markets presents distinct risks and, in many cases, requires us to address the particular requirements of that market.\nAddressing these requirements can be time-consuming and costly. Adoption of LiDAR products, including our products for these segments, will depend on numerous factors,\nincluding: whether the technological capabilities of LiDAR and LiDAR-based products meet users’ current or anticipated needs, whether the benefits of designing LiDAR into larger\nsensing systems outweigh the costs, complexity and time needed to deploy such technology, or replace or modify existing systems that may have used other modalities such as\ncameras and/or radar, whether users in other applications can move beyond the testing and development phases and proceed to commercializing systems supported by LiDAR\ntechnology and whether LiDAR developers such as us can keep pace with rapid technological change in certain developing markets. If LiDAR technology does not achieve\ncommercial success in such markets, or if the market develops at a pace slower than we expect, our business, results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected.\n9\nAdverse conditions in the automotive industry or the global economy more generally could have adverse effects on our results of operations.\nOur business is directly affected by and significantly dependent on business cycles and other factors affecting the global automotive industry and global economy in general.\nAutomotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including consumer spending and preferences, changes in interest\nrates and credit availability, consumer confidence, fuel costs, fuel availability, environmental impact, governmental incentives, regulatory requirements and political volatility,\nespecially in energy-producing countries and growth markets. In addition, automotive production and sales can be affected by our automotive OEM customers’ ability to continue\noperating in response to challenging economic conditions and in response to regulatory requirements and other factors. The volume of automotive production in North America,\nEurope, China and the rest of the world has fluctuated, sometimes significantly, from year to year, and we expect any such fluctuations to give rise to fluctuations in the demand for\nour products. Any significant adverse change in any of these factors may result in a reduction in automotive sales and production by our automotive OEM customers and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience difficulties in expanding our operations.\nOur ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, compliance programs and\nreporting systems. We continue to strengthen our compliance programs, including our compliance programs related to export controls, privacy and cybersecurity and anti-corruption.\nWe may not be able to implement improvements in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing controls, programs, systems and procedures, which could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial results.\nAs part of growing our business, we may in the future make acquisitions. If we fail to successfully select, execute or integrate our acquisitions, then our business, results of\noperations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and the price of our ordinary shares and warrants could decline.\nFrom time to time, we may in the future undertake acquisitions to add new products and technologies, acquire talent, gain new sales channels or enter into new markets or sales\nterritories. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including relating to the successful integration of the acquired business and its key personnel, entering into new\nterritories or markets with which we have limited or no prior experience, establishing or maintaining business relationships with new customers, channel partners, vendors and\nsuppliers, as well as unexpected liabilities and potential post-closing disputes. In addition, acquisitions may require a significant commitment of management time, capital investment\nand other resources.\nTo date, we have not grown our business through acquisitions and we do not have a history of integrating acquired technology and personnel. However, failure to successfully\nidentify, complete, manage and integrate any future acquisitions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the\nprice of our ordinary shares and warrants to decline.\nThe first vehicles deploying our LiDAR technology and software are expected to become commercially available to end users in 2024. If any vehicles deploying our LiDAR\ntechnology and software are involved in traffic accidents or collisions actually or allegedly resulting from undetected defects, errors, or bugs in our products, or if our products\nactually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, we may be exposed to product liability, warranty and other claims, in addition to a decline in the market adoption of our\nproducts, damage to our reputation with current or prospective customers, or increased regulatory scrutiny of our solutions which would adversely affect our operating costs,\nbusiness and prospects.\nOur products are technologically complex and require high standards to manufacture and may, from time to time, have, or could be alleged to have, undetected errors or\ndefects. As the first vehicles deploying our LiDAR technology and software are expected to become commercially available to end users in 2024, some errors or defects in our\nproducts could be, despite rigorous testing and stringent manufacturing standards, initially undetected and discovered only after they have commercialized and deployed by\ncustomers, which could result in serious injury, including fatalities, to the end users or those in the surrounding area; our customers not being able to commercialize technology\nincorporating our products; litigation against us; negative publicity; and other consequences. These risks are particularly prevalent in the highly competitive autonomous driving and\nADAS markets. In accordance with customary practice in the automotive industry, we provide our customer with a time-limited warranty for our products. If such errors or defects\noccur within the respective warranty period, we may incur significant additional development costs, repair or replacement costs. Such problems may also result in claims against us,\nincluding class actions, by our customers or by third parties, and in some cases, may even lead to product recall and additional costs associated with such processes. Our reputation or\nbrand may be damaged as a result of these problems and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and\nattract new customers, and could adversely affect our financial results.\n10\nIn addition, we could face material legal claims for breach of contract, product liability, tort or breach of warranty as a result of these problems. Defending a lawsuit, regardless\nof its merit, could be costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely affect the market’s perception of us and our products. In addition, our business liability insurance\ncoverage could prove inadequate with respect to a claim and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms or at all. These product-related issues could result in claims\nagainst us and our business could be adversely affected.\nMoreover, enhanced publicity surrounding such claims may also increase the regulatory scrutiny of ADAS and autonomous driving solutions in general, and our products in\nparticular, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business plans. Further, legislation and regulations may be adopted or changed over time to\nincrease our liability associated with the use of our products, which may make our liability insurance coverage inadequate to fully mitigate such risks or rather make it significantly\nmore costly, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market against a large number of both established competitors and new market entrants, and some market participants have\nsubstantially greater resources than ours.\nThe markets for sensing technology applicable to autonomous solutions across numerous industries are highly competitive. Our future success will depend on our ability to lead\nby continuing to develop and protect from infringement advanced LiDAR technology in a timely manner, and to stay ahead of existing and new competitors. Our competitors are\nnumerous and they compete with us directly by offering LiDAR products, and indirectly by attempting to solve some of the same challenges with different technology. We face\ncompetition from other developers of LiDAR products, Tier-1 suppliers and other technology and automotive supply companies, some of which have significantly greater resources\nthan we do. Our competitors include, among others: Hesai, Robosense, Seyond (ex-Innovusion), Ouster, Luminar, AEye, Aeva, Valeo SA and Cepton In the automotive market, some\nof our competitors have commercialized non-LiDAR-based ADAS technology which has achieved market adoption, strong brand recognition and may continue to improve these and\nadditional technologies, further enhancing their brand recognition and standing. Other competitors are working towards commercializing autonomous driving technology and either\nby themselves, or with a publicly announced partner, have substantial financial, marketing, research and development and other resources. Some of our customers in the autonomous\nvehicle and ADAS markets have announced development efforts or made acquisitions directed at creating their own LiDAR-based or other sensing technologies, which would\ncompete with our solutions. We do not know how close these competitors are to commercializing autonomous driving systems or novel ADAS applications. Additionally, increased\ncompetition may result in pricing pressure and reduced margins and may impede our ability to increase the sales of our products or may cause us to lose market share, either of which\nwill adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our future profitability.\nFactors that could materially affect our future effective tax rates include but are not limited to:\n• changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment;\n• changes in accounting and tax standards or practices;\n• changes in the composition of operating income by tax jurisdiction; and\n• our operating results before taxes.\nBecause we do not have a long history of operating at our present scale and we have significant expansion plans, our effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future. Future\neffective tax rates could be affected by operating losses in jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be recorded under U.S. GAAP, changes in the composition of earnings in countries\nwith differing tax rates, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws.\n11\nChanges in our product mix may impact our financial performance.\nOur financial performance can be affected by the mix of products we sell during a given period. If our sales include more of our lower gross margin products, our results of\noperations and financial condition may be adversely affected. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully alter our product mix. If actual results vary from this\nprojected product mix of sales, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the services of Omer Keilaf, our Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Director.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of Omer Keilaf, our Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and director. Mr. Keilaf has been our\nChief Executive Officer since the founding of the company in 2016, remains deeply involved in all aspects of our business, and is the name and face that customers, suppliers and\ninvestors associate with Innoviz. The loss of Mr. Keilaf would adversely affect our business, since his loss could make it more difficult to, among other things, compete with other\nmarket participants and retain existing customers or cultivate new ones. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the marketplace and may make it more difficult to retain\nexisting employees and members of management.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and senior management. In addition, we are highly dependent on our skilled personnel to\nmanage and meet deadlines for our products and programs.\nWe compete in a market marked by rapidly changing technologies and an evolving competitive landscape. In order for us to successfully compete and grow, we must attract,\nrecruit, retain and develop personnel with requisite qualifications to provide expertise across the entire spectrum of our intellectual capital and business needs.\nOn January 31, 2024, we announced a strategic realignment of our operations to expand our cash runway and optimize our path towards profitability and free cash flow\ngeneration, which included a reduction in the company’s headcount by approximately 13% during the first quarter of 2024. Such workforce reduction may make it more difficult to\npreserve our company organizational culture and may negatively impact employees’ morale.\nOur primary research and development activities as well as significant elements of our operations, general and administrative activities are conducted at our headquarters in\nIsrael, and we face significant competition for suitably skilled employees in Israel. Many of the companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than\nwe do, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional experienced or professional personnel, in retaining personnel or in effectively replacing such current personnel who may\ndepart with qualified or effective successors. Our efforts to attract, retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our\nprofitability. Furthermore, in making employment decisions, particularly in the high-technology industry, job candidates often consider the value of the equity they are to receive in\nconnection with their employment. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their equity incentive awards have significantly\ndecreased in value.\nWhile we utilize non-competition agreements with our employees as a means of improving our employee retention, those agreements may not help us retain employees. These\nagreements prohibit our employees, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period. We may be unable to enforce\nthese agreements under Israeli law, and it may be difficult for us to restrict our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of our former employees developed while working for\nus.\nIn addition, we rely on our skilled personnel, including our engineers, to meet deadlines associated with our numerous products and programs. As we continue to invest in our\nproducts and programs, we will rely more and more on our skilled personnel to ensure that we are meeting the development and commercialization targets we set internally and with\nour partners. As we invest in our products and programs, our skilled personnel may not be able to give the same level of attention to each product and program, and it may become\nmore difficult for us to continue to meet the internal and external deadlines associated with such products and programs.\nConsidering the foregoing, there can be no assurance that qualified employees will remain in our employ or that we will be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel\nand senior management in the future. Failure to retain or attract highly skilled personnel and senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Human resource changes could affect our internal knowledge and expertise, strategic relationships and future growth prospects.\n12\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.\nWe report our financial results in U.S. dollars. We collect our revenue primarily in U.S. dollars. A portion of the cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing\nand general and administrative expenses of our Israeli operations are incurred in ILS. As a result, we are exposed to exchange rate risks that may materially and adversely affect our\nfinancial results. If ILS appreciates against the USD or if the value of ILS declines against the USD at a time when the rate of inflation in the cost of Israeli goods and services\nexceeds the rate of decline in the relative value of ILS, then the USD cost of our operations in Israel would increase and our results of operations could be materially and adversely\naffected. Our Israeli operations also could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to effectively hedge against currency fluctuations in the future. We cannot predict any\nfuture trends in the rate of inflation in Israel or the rate of appreciation (if any) of ILS against the USD. The Israeli annual rate of inflation amounted to 3.0%, 5.3%, and 2.8% for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The ILS depreciated relative to the USD by 3.1% and 13.2% in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and appreciated relative to\nthe USD by 3.3% in 2021.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and are susceptible to supply shortages, long lead times for components and supply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply chain\nand could delay deliveries of our products to customers.\nSome of the components that go into the manufacture of our solutions are sourced from third-party suppliers. Some of the key components used to manufacture our products\ncome from limited or single source suppliers. We are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risks that our suppliers\ndiscontinue or modify components used in our products. Other global events, including political events and trade-related trends may also disrupt our supply chain and operations,\nsuch as the Houthi movement, a terrorist group in Yemen, that are threatening to limit the movement of marine vessels traversing the Red Sea, and have led to delays in shipping and\nto increased shipping and transport costs; or other events which may delay our future production and our timeline for setting up a production line in China, which may require us to\nfind alternative location for our production line due to instabilities. In addition, our products depend on external semi-conductor foundries. Any disruptions to those foundries could\nmaterially and adversely affect our ability to manufacture our solutions. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in\nquantities and delivery schedules. We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience component shortages and price fluctuations of certain key components and\nmaterials, and the predictability of the availability and pricing of these components may be limited. In the event of a component shortage, supply interruption or material pricing\nchange from suppliers of these components, we may not be able to develop alternate sources in a timely manner or at all in the case of sole or limited sources. Any interruption or\ndelay in the supply of any of these parts or components, or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable\namount of time, could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our operating results. In addition,\nincreased component costs could result in lower gross margins. Even where we are able to pass increased component costs along to our customers, there may be a lapse of time\nbefore we are able to do so, such that we must absorb the increased cost. If we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis,\nwe will not be able to deliver products to our customers, which may result in loss of revenues, or such customers using competitors’ products instead of ours.\nOur sales and operations in international markets expose us to operational, financial and regulatory risks.\nInternational sales comprise a significant amount of our overall revenue. Sales to international customers accounted for approximately 99.6%, 98% and 99% of our revenue in\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We are committed to growing our international sales and, while we have committed resources to expanding our\ninternational operations and sales channels, these efforts may not be successful. International operations are subject to a number of other risks, including:\n• exchange rate fluctuations;\n• political and economic instability, international terrorism and anti-Israeli sentiment, such as the war and hostilities between Israel and Hamas and Israel and Hezbollah;\n• global or regional health crises;\n• potential for violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as those related to bribery and fraud;\n• preference for locally branded products, and laws and business practices favoring local competition;\n• potential complexities of operating in China with increased data collection regulations, and government-mandates which are subject to change per unprecedented\nregulation;\n13\n• increased difficulty in managing inventory;\n• delayed revenue recognition;\n• less effective protection of intellectual property;\n• stringent regulation of the autonomous or other systems or products using our products and stringent consumer protection and product compliance regulations, including\nbut not limited to General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union (the “EU”), European competition law, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive,\nthe Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive and the European Ecodesign directive that are costly to comply with, and may vary from country to country;\n• difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;\n• import and export laws and the impact of tariffs; and\n• changes in local tax and customs duty laws, or changes in the enforcement, application or interpretation of such laws.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could negatively affect our international business and consequently our business, operating results and financial condition.\nUnforeseen eye safety issues could result in injuries to people which could result in adverse effects on our business and reputation.\nOur LiDAR utilizes lasers for performing 3D sensing. While our LiDAR products are classified as Class 1 laser products, which are safe to use, and we have developed system\ncomponents designed to prevent our LiDAR lasers from harming human eyes, in the event that an unforeseen issue arises that results in serious injury, our reputation or brand may be\ndamaged and we could face material legal claims for breach of contract, product liability, tort or breach of warranty as a result of these problems. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of\nits merit, could be costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely affect the market’s perception of us and our products. In addition, our business liability insurance\ncoverage could prove inadequate with respect to a claim and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, including events resulting from climate change, as well as global\npandemics, and interruptions by man-made problems, such as network security breaches, computer viruses, terrorism and war. Material disruptions of our business or\ninformation systems resulting from these events could adversely affect our operating results.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood or significant power outage or other similar events, such as infectious disease outbreaks or pandemic events,\ncould have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. There are inherent physical climate-related risks wherever our business is conducted. Various meteorological\nphenomena and extreme weather events (including, but not limited to, storms, flooding, drought, wildfire, and extreme temperatures) may disrupt our operations or those of our\nsuppliers and business partners, and may therefore require us to incur additional operating or capital expenditures, or otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations. Climate change may impact the frequency and/or intensity of such events. Mitigating our business risks associated with climate change may require us to incur\nsubstantial costs and may not be successful, due to, among other things, the uncertainty associated with the longer-term projections associated with managing climate risks.\nIn addition, despite the implementation of network security measures, our networks and LiDAR products also may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar\ndisruptions from unauthorized tampering with our solutions. In addition, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war, could cause disruptions in our manufacturing operations, our\ncustomers’, suppliers’ or channel partners’ businesses, or the economy as a whole. We also rely on information technology systems to communicate among our workforce and with\nthird parties. Any disruption to our communications, whether caused by a natural disaster or by manmade problems, such as power disruptions, could adversely affect our business.\nWe do not currently have a formal disaster recovery plan. However, we are currently in the process of formalizing our plan, and auditing our suppliers’ plans by our quality\npersonnel. However, to the extent that any such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders or impede our suppliers’ ability to timely deliver product components, or the\ndeployment of our products, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\n14\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized parties from copying or reverse engineering our solutions. Our\nefforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and prevent third parties from violating our rights may be costly.\nThe success of our products and our business depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights and maintain adequate legal protection for our\nproducts in the United States and other international jurisdictions. We rely on a combination of patent, registered design, copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as\nwell as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We cannot assure you that\nany patents will be issued with respect to our currently pending patent applications or that any trademarks will be registered with respect to our currently pending applications in a\nmanner that gives us adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, if at all, or that any patents issued to us or any trademarks registered by it will not be challenged,\ninvalidated or circumvented. We have filed for patents and trademarks in the United States and in certain international jurisdictions, but such protections may not be available in all\ncountries in which we operate or in which we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, or may be difficult to enforce in practice, particularly with respect to software patents,\nwhere infringement is significantly harder to prove, we are less likely to successfully assert our patents. Our currently issued patents and trademarks and any patents and trademarks\nthat may be issued or registered, as applicable, in the future with respect to pending or future applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be\nenforceable in actions against alleged infringers. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or the reverse engineering of our\ntechnology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, products and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult, particularly internationally. We believe that\nour patents are foundational and we intend to enforce the intellectual property portfolio we have built. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or reverse engineer our solutions or\ncertain aspects of our solutions that we consider proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to prevent unauthorized\nparties from copying or reverse engineering our solutions, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to block the importation of infringing products\nfrom one patent jurisdiction into another jurisdiction.\nEffective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available and competitors\nbased in other countries may sell infringing products in one or more markets. An inability to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights or an\ninability to prevent authorized parties from copying or reverse engineering our LiDAR solutions or certain aspects of our solutions that we consider proprietary could seriously\nadversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how.\nWe rely on proprietary information (such as trade secrets, know-how and confidential information) to protect intellectual property that may not be patentable or subject to\ncopyright, trademark, trade dress or service mark protection, or that we believe is best protected by means that do not require public disclosure.\nWe generally seek to protect this proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements or consulting, services or employment agreements that contain non-\ndisclosure and non-use provisions with our employees, consultants, contractors and third parties. However, we may fail to enter into the necessary agreements, and even if entered\ninto, these agreements may be breached or may otherwise fail to prevent disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary information, may be limited as to\ntheir term and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure or use of proprietary information. In addition, our proprietary information may otherwise\nbecome known or be independently developed by our competitors or other third parties. To the extent that our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors and other third parties use\nintellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Costly and time-consuming litigation\ncould be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain protection for our proprietary information could adversely affect our\ncompetitive business position.\nWe also rely on physical and electronic security measures to protect our proprietary information, but we cannot provide assurance that these security measures will not be\nbreached or provide adequate protection for our property. There is a risk that third parties may obtain and improperly utilize our proprietary information to our competitive\ndisadvantage. We may not be able to detect or prevent the unauthorized use of such information or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.\n15\nThird-party claims that we are infringing or misappropriating intellectual property, whether successful or not, could result in costly and time-consuming litigation or\nexpensive licenses, and our business could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we hold patents related to our products, a number of companies, both within and outside of the LiDAR industry, hold other patents covering aspects of LiDAR\nproducts. In addition to these patents, participants in this industry typically also protect their technology, especially embedded software, through copyrights and trade secrets. As a\nresult, there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may receive in the future inquiries from\nother intellectual property holders and may become subject to claims that we infringed or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, particularly as we expand our presence in\nthe market. If such a claim were to prevail, we could incur high cost and time-consuming litigation and licensing fees. Alternatively, we may incur costly development of alternative\ntechnological solutions to work-around such patent-protected solutions. In addition, parties may claim that the names and branding of our products infringe their trademark rights in\ncertain countries or territories. If such a claim were to prevail, we may have to change the names and branding of our products in the affected territories and it could incur other costs.\nWe currently have a number of agreements in effect pursuant to which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers, suppliers and partners from\ndamages and costs which may arise from the infringement or misappropriation by our products of third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. The scope of these\nindemnity obligations varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. Our insurance may not cover all intellectual\nproperty infringement claims. A claim that our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, even if untrue, could adversely affect our relationships with our customers,\nmay deter future customers from purchasing our products and could expose us to costly litigation and settlement expenses. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a\ncustomer and a third party relating to infringement by our products, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our products against\nintellectual property infringement claims in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Any of these results could adversely affect our brand and operating results.\nOur defense of intellectual property rights claims brought against us or our customers, suppliers and channel partners, with or without merit, could be time-consuming,\nexpensive to litigate or settle, divert management resources and attention and force us to acquire intellectual property rights and licenses, which may involve substantial royalty or\nother payments and may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Further, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial\ndamages or obtain an injunction. An adverse determination could invalidate our intellectual property rights and adversely affect our ability to offer our products to our customers and\nmay require that we procure or develop substitute products that do not infringe, which could require significant effort and expense. Any of these events could adversely affect our\nbusiness, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe are subject to, and must remain in compliance with, numerous laws and governmental regulations concerning the manufacturing, use, distribution and sale of our\nproducts. Some of our customers also require that we comply with their own unique requirements relating to these matters.\nWe manufacture and sell products that contain electronic components, and such components may contain materials that are subject to government regulation in both the\nlocations where we manufacture and assemble our products, as well as the locations where we sell our products. For example, in the United States, laser-emitting products, including\nour LiDAR systems, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), under the Electronic Product Radiation Control Provisions of the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. Among other things, these laws and regulations require the submission of annual reports to the FDA certifying that such\nproducts comply with applicable performance standards, the maintenance of manufacturing, testing, and distribution records, and the reporting of certain product defects to the FDA\nand/or consumers. If our products fail to comply with applicable FDA regulations, we and/or our products could be subjected to a variety of enforcement actions or sanctions, such as\nproduct recalls, repairs or replacements, warning letters, untitled letters, safety alerts, injunctions, import alerts, administrative product detentions or seizures or civil penalties. The\noccurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSince we operate on a global basis, we must continually monitor applicable laws and regulations, and engage in an ongoing compliance process to ensure that we and our\nsuppliers comply in all material respects with the applicable laws and regulations. If there is an unanticipated or onerous new legislation or regulation that significantly impacts our\nuse or marketing of various components or requires more expensive components, such legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\n16\nOur products are also used for autonomous driving and ADAS applications, which are subject to complicated and rapidly evolving laws and regulatory schemes that vary from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction at the state, federal and international levels, including requirements related to safety, data privacy and security, and product liability, among other areas.\nThese are rapidly evolving areas in which new or changed requirements could impose limitations on the use of LiDAR generally or our products specifically. If we fail to adhere to\nthese new laws and regulations or fail to continually monitor emerging developments, we may be subject to litigation, loss of customers or negative publicity and our business, and\nour results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nConcerns over environmental pollution and climate change have produced significant legislative and regulatory efforts on a global basis, and we believe this will continue both\nin scope and in the number of countries participating. These changes could directly increase the cost, of or access to, energy or water, which may have an effect on the way we\nmanufacture products or utilizes energy or water to produce our products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of raw materials\nor key components we use in our products. Environmental regulations require us to reduce product energy or water usage, monitor and exclude an expanding list of restricted\nsubstances and to participate in required recovery and recycling of its products. We are unable to predict how any future changes will impact us and if such impacts will be material to\nour business.\nReporting expectations are also increasing, with a variety of customers, capital providers, and regulators seeking increased information on climate-related risks and impacts.\nVarious policymakers have adopted or are considering to adopt, requirements for companies to provide significantly expanded climate-related disclosures in their periodic reporting,\nincluding reporting requirements that require companies to monitor their third parties, any of which may require us to incur significant additional costs to comply, including the\nimplementation of significant additional internal controls processes and procedures regarding matters that have not been subject to such controls in the past, and impose increased\noversight obligations on our management and board of directors. All of these risks may also impact our suppliers, business partners or customers, which may indirectly impact our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in automotive safety regulations or concerns that drive further regulation of the automobile safety market.\nGovernment vehicle safety regulations are an important factor for our business. Historically, these regulations have imposed ever-more stringent safety regulations for vehicles.\nThese safety regulations often require, or customers demand that, vehicles have more safety features per vehicle and more advanced safety products.\nAlthough we believe increasing automotive safety standards will present a market opportunity for our products, government safety regulations are subject to change based on a\nnumber of factors that are not within our control, including but not limited to, new scientific or technological data, public concerns regarding alleged safety risks of ADAS or\nautonomous driving, adverse publicity generated by government safety investigations, industry recalls or accidents, domestic and foreign political developments or considerations,\nand litigation relating to our products and our competitors’ products. Changes in government regulations, as well as changes or evolution in court doctrines in interpreting those\nregulations, especially in the ADAS and autonomous driving industries, could adversely affect our business. If government priorities shift and we are unable to adapt to changing\nregulations or to court interpretations of those regulations, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn the United States at the federal government level, regulation of ADAS and autonomous driving falls primarily within the purview of the National Highway Traffic Safety\nAdministration (“NHTSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), although other USDOT divisions, such as, for example, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety\nAdministration (FMCSA), also are engaged to a more limited extent. Other federal agencies also are involved in regulation as relevant to the agency’s mission; for example, the\nFederal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has jurisdiction over spectrum for communications technology that that will allow vehicles to sense and communicate with each other\nand with other devices and environmental factors, such as infrastructure, pedestrians, and cyclists. USDOT envisions a division of responsibility between the federal government and\nthe states whereby NHTSA regulates safety design and performance while states regulate human driver and vehicle operations. Both federal and state authorities in the U.S. have\nbeen actively engaged in regulatory scrutiny of ADAS and autonomous driving solutions in general. Such authorities may impose more stringent compliance and reporting\nrequirements in response to product recalls and safety issues in the automotive industry.\nFor any of our products incorporated into vehicles, we are a vehicle equipment manufacturer subject to existing requirements under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle\nSafety Act of 1966 (“Vehicle Safety Act”) and the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and other regulations promulgated by the NHTSA pursuant thereto. These\nrequirements include a duty to report, subject to strict timing requirements, any defect with our products that is related to motor vehicle safety. The Vehicle Safety Act imposes\npotentially significant civil penalties for violations, including for failure to report such defects. We are also subject to the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and\nDocumentation Act (“TREAD”) and NHTSA’s implementing regulations and must comply with “Early Warning” requirements by reporting a wide range of information (e.g.,\nconsumer complaints, warranty claims, etc.) that could indicate a potential safety defect. TREAD imposes criminal liability for violating such requirements if a defect is confirmed\nsubsequently and has caused death or bodily injury. In addition, the Vehicle Safety Act authorizes NHTSA to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles with any safety\ndefect or that fail to comply with any FMVSS, and this obligation would apply in the event our products had a safety defect and prompted such a recall and repair action. Our\ndistribution into foreign countries may be subject to similar regulations. If we cannot rapidly address any safety concerns or defects with our products, our business may be adversely\naffected.\n17\nNHTSA also has taken a number of actions in the past several years specific to ADAS and autonomous driving. These actions include a Standing General Order, updated in\nAugust 2021, that requires identified manufacturers and operators to report certain crashes involving vehicles equipped with automated driving systems or SAE Level 2 advanced\ndriver assistance systems. In addition, NHTSA expanded in January 2021 its Automated Vehicle Transparency and Engagement for Safe Testing (“AV TEST”) Initiative from a pilot\nto a full program, and through this Initiative a variety of stakeholders provide documentation covering specific topics, such as how automated systems detect objects on the road, how\ninformation is displayed to drivers, what cybersecurity measures are in place and the methods used to test the design and validation of autonomous driving systems. NHTSA has been\nutilizing this information to impose additional regulatory obligations on ADAS and automated driving systems. In particular, NHTSA has been engaged in rulemaking to update\ncertain FMVSS to address ambiguities and other issues created by the application of FMVSS to innovative, non-conventional vehicle designs utilized, or anticipated to be utilized, in\ncertain ADAS and autonomous driving vehicles. In 2023, NHTSA promulgated the “Occupant Protection for Vehicles with Automated Driving Systems” final rule to update several\nFMVSS to account for vehicles that are equipped with ADAS and do not have traditional manual controls associated with human drivers. NHTSA also proposed rules to update\nFMVSS for crash avoidance, safety messaging and passengerless vehicles as well as jointly proposed a rule with FMCSA regarding advanced emergency breaking (“AEB”) test\ndevices for heavy vehicles. NHTSA also announced plans to launch a new initiative called ADS-Equipped Vehicle Safety, Transparency and Evaluation Program (“AV STEP”) that\nwould remove the 2,500 cap on driverless vehicles allowed on the roadways and expand the program for exemption from FVMSS for ADS-equipped vehicles, but would impose\nadditional data reporting requirements on all vehicles participating in AV STEP.\nTo the extent such additional obligations apply to our products, our compliance obligations may increase, and to the extent such additional obligations require changes in the\ndesign or operation of our products, we could suffer adverse business consequences.\nFailures, or perceived failures, to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security requirements in the variety of jurisdictions in which we operate may\nadversely impact our business, and such legal requirements are evolving, uncertain and may require improvements in, or changes to, our policies and operations.\nOur current and potential future operations and sales involve the processing of data (including personal information) and thus subject us, and may subject our customers and\nvendors, to a variety of federal, state, and foreign data privacy laws, rules, industry standards, regulations, and other requirements addressing privacy and the collection, use, storage,\nprocessing, disclosure, transfer and protection of a variety of types of data. These requirements, and their application, interpretation and amendment are constantly evolving and\ndeveloping. For example, the UK and EU General Data Protection Regulations are directly applicable across the UK and European Economic Area; China has recently adopted a\nstringent new data privacy and security framework; Japan has amended its regime and California has enacted the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) (which has\nprompted a wave of similar laws in other states such as Utah (“UCPA”), Connecticut (“CTDPA”) and others), the IL Protection of Privacy law, 5741-1981 has been recently amended\nand extended its reach over Israeli residents as well as personal information of EU residents transferred to Israel, each of which provide for potentially material penalties for non-\ncompliance. These regimes may, among other things, impose data security requirements, disclosure and contracting requirements, and restrictions on data collection, uses, transfers\nand sharing that may impact our operations and the development of our business. While, generally, we do not have access to, neither do we collect, store, process, or share\ninformation collected by our solutions in the course of their use by our end users or customers, unless our customers choose to proactively provide such information to us, our\nproducts may evolve both to address potential customer requirements or to add new features and functionality. Therefore, the full impact of these privacy regimes on our business is\nrapidly evolving across jurisdictions and remains uncertain at this time.\nEven though we and our vendors periodically assess the continually evolving privacy and data security regimes and consider measures we believe are appropriate to take in\nresponse, these laws are in some cases relatively new and their interpretation and application are uncertain. In addition, we are subject to our customers’ privacy and data security\nrequirements and audits and are working to enhance our privacy and data security measures as a result. Since these privacy and data security regimes and requirements are evolving,\nuncertain and complex, especially for a global business like ours, we may need to update or enhance our compliance measures even further as our products, markets and customer\ndemands further develop, and these updates or enhancements may require implementation costs. Moreover, the compliance measures we adopt may prove ineffective. Any failure, or\nperceived failure, by us to comply with data privacy laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements could result in significant proceedings or actions against us by\nindividuals, consumer rights groups, government agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs (including the costs of mitigation and recovery) in investigating and defending\nsuch claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages or fines or be required to make changes to our business. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes\nmay subject us to material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation and brand, loss of proprietary information and data, disruption to our business and\nrelationships, and diminished ability to retain or attract customers and business partners and a breach of our commitments to our customers. If any of these events were to occur, they\ncould have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and business.\n18\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks to operational systems, security systems, infrastructure, firmware in our LiDAR and customer data and other information processed\nby us or third-party vendors or suppliers, and any material failure, weakness, interruption, cyber event, incident, or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating\nour business.\nWe rely on computer systems, hardware, software, technology infrastructure and online sites and networks for both internal and external operations that are critical to our\nbusiness (collectively, “IT Systems”). We own and manage some of these IT Systems but also rely on third parties for a range of IT Systems and related products and services. We\nand certain of our third-party providers store, handle, transmit and otherwise process data that includes information about individuals as well as proprietary information such as trade\nsecrets (collectively, “Confidential Information”).\nWe face numerous and evolving cyber risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT Systems and Confidential Information, including from diverse\nthreat actors, such as insiders (through inadvertence or with malicious intent) or malicious third parties (including nation-states or nation-state supported actors), as well as through\ndiverse attack vectors, such as social engineering/phishing, malware (including ransomware), malfeasance by insiders, human or technological error, and as a result of malicious code\nembedded in open-source software, or misconfigurations, bugs or other vulnerabilities in commercial software that is integrated into our (or our suppliers’ or service providers’) IT\nSystems, products or services. Threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques and tools—including artificial intelligence—that circumvent any\ninfrastructure we use to protect our network, evade detection and remove forensic evidence. As a result, we may be unable to detect, investigate, remediate or recover from future\nattacks or incidents, or to avoid a material adverse impact to our IT Systems, Confidential Information or business. Such cyber incidents could materially disrupt operational systems\nand cause disruption to our business; result in loss of Confidential Information; jeopardize the security of our facilities; impact our financial results; or affect the performance of in-\nproduct technology and the integrated software in our LiDAR solutions. In addition, we rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise process some of such data, and any\nfailure by a third party, or any other entity in our collective supply chain, to prevent or mitigate data security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration,\nor destruction of, such data could have similar adverse consequences for us.\nFor instance, cyber criminals or insiders may target us or third parties with which we have business relationships in an effort to obtain Confidential Information, or in a manner\nthat disrupts our operations or our development tools or compromises our products or IT Systems into which our products are integrated. Cyber criminals could also target accessing\nour IT Systems in a manner which could impact our sensor data or the development process. Remote and hybrid working arrangements at our company (and at many third-party\nproviders) also increase cybersecurity risks due to the challenges associated with managing and controlling remote computing assets and security vulnerabilities that are present in\nmany non-corporate and home network devices. The techniques used by cyber attackers change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. We have\nexperienced and expect to continue to experience actual and attempted cyber-attacks of our IT networks, such as through phishing scams and ransomware. Although, to our\nknowledge, none of these actual or attempted cyber-attacks have had a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition, we cannot guarantee that any such incidents\nwill not have such an impact in the future. We are also at risk for cyber incidents resulting from interruptions, outages and breaches of: operational systems, including business,\nfinancial, accounting, product development, data processing or production processes, owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; facility security systems, owned by us or\nour third-party vendors or suppliers; in-product technology owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; the integrated software in our LiDAR solutions or development tools;\nor customer or driver data that we process or our third-party vendors or suppliers process on our behalf.\n19\nAlthough we maintain information technology measures designed to protect our IT Systems and Confidential Information, such measures will require updates and\nimprovements, and we cannot guarantee that such measures, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in detecting,\npreventing or mitigating cyber incidents. The implementation, maintenance, segregation and ongoing improvement of our IT Systems requires significant management time, support\nand cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving, expanding and updating current IT Systems, including the disruption of our data management,\nprocurement, production execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or\nsupplies or produce, sell, deliver and service our solutions, adequately protect our Confidential Information or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits\nunder, applicable laws, regulations and contracts. If we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these IT Systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability\nto accurately and timely report our financial results could be impaired, and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to\ncertify our financial results. Further, our Confidential Information could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these IT Systems do not\noperate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.\nAny adverse impact to the availability, integrity or confidentiality of our IT Systems or Confidential Information could impact production capability and our ongoing\noperations, harm our reputation, cause us to breach our contracts with other parties or subject us to regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, fines and penalties, litigation\n(including class actions), negative reputational impacts that may cause us to lose existing or future customers, and/or significant incident response, system restoration or remediation\nand future compliance costs. Any or all of the foregoing could materially affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Any problems with our third-party\ncloud hosting providers, whether due to cyber security failures or other causes, could result in lengthy interruptions in our business. Finally, we cannot guarantee that any costs and\nliabilities incurred in relation to a cybersecurity attack or incident will be covered by our existing insurance policies or that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on\neconomically reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U.S. and foreign anti-corruption anti-money laundering, export control,\nsanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and\ntrade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977,\nas amended (the “FCPA”), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, the\nProceeds of Crime Act 2002, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries outside of the United States in which we conduct our activities. Compliance\nwith these laws has been the subject of increasing focus and activity by regulatory authorities, both in the United States and elsewhere, in recent years. Anti-corruption laws are\ninterpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or accepting, directly or\nindirectly, improper payments or benefits to or from any person whether in the public or private sector. Our activities outside the United States may create the risk of unauthorized\npayments or offers of payments by employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement\nsafeguards to discourage these practices by our employees, consultants, sales agents and distributors. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be\nless than effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible, even if it does not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities.\nNoncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations,\nsanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or\ndebarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or\ninvestigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be materially harmed. Responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and\nsignificant defense and compliance costs and other professional fees. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability for FCPA violations\ncommitted by companies in which it invests or that it acquires. As a general matter, enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\n20\nRegulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the\nmanufacturing of our products.\nWe are subject to the requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, that requires us to determine,\ndisclose and report whether our products contain tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, referred to as conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect\nthe sourcing, availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the\ndisclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used in or necessary to the production of\nour products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. It is also possible that our reputation\nmay be adversely affected if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act or if we are unable to\nalter our products, processes or sources of supply to avoid use of such materials.\nIncreasing attention to, and evolving expectations regarding, environmental, social and sustainability matters may impact our business and reputation.\nEvolving and increased expectations regarding environmental, social and sustainability initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs, enhanced compliance or\ndisclosure obligations, or other impacts to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Moreover, our environmental, social and sustainability initiatives may be costly\nand may not have the desired effect, or we may ultimately be unable to complete certain initiatives or targets, either on the timelines initially announced or at all, due to technological,\nlegal, cost, or other constraints, which may be within or outside of our control. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party\ninformation that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. If we fail to, or are perceived to fail to,\ncomply with or advance certain environmental, social or sustainability initiatives, we may be subject to various adverse impacts, including reputational damage, activism and\npotential stakeholder engagement and/or litigation. Additionally, many of our customers, business partners, and suppliers may be subject to similar expectations, which may augment\nor create additional risks, including risks that may not be known to us.\nA market for our securities may not be sustained, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nAn active trading market for our securities may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, the\nincreasing interest rate, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if our securities become delisted from Nasdaq and are quoted on the OTC\nBulletin Board (an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange), the liquidity and price of our securities may be more\nlimited than if we were quoted or listed on the NYSE, Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or\nsustained.\nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain\nthe adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our ordinary shares.\nOur business is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will\ncontinue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our\npersonnel, systems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are\ncontinuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that\ninformation required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to\nimprove our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our internal\ncontrols may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could\nadversely affect our operating results or cause it to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to\nimplement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting\nfirm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that it is required to include in our periodic reports we will file with the SEC under\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in\nour reported financial and other information.\n21\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended and anticipates\nthat we will continue to expend significant resources, including accounting-related costs, and provide significant management oversight. Any failure to maintain the adequacy of our\ninternal controls, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially and adversely affect our\nability to operate our business. In the event that our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors\nmay lose confidence in our operating results and the price of our ordinary shares and warrants could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we\nmay not be able to maintain our listing on Nasdaq.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an\nemerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our\ncontrols are documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse\neffect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares and Warrants\nOur amended and restated articles of association (the “Articles”) and Israeli law could prevent a takeover that shareholders consider favorable and could also reduce the\nmarket price of our ordinary shares and warrants.\nCertain provisions of Israeli law and our Articles could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire\nus or for our shareholders to elect different individuals to our board of directors, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders and warrantholders, and may limit the price\nthat investors may be willing to pay in the future for the our ordinary shares and warrants. For example, the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999 (the “Companies Law”) regulates\nmergers, requires that a tender offer be effected when certain thresholds of percentage ownership of voting power in a company are exceeded (subject to certain conditions) and\nestablishes a high ownership threshold to squeeze out minority shareholders in a full tender offer. Further, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions undesirable to us\nor to some of our shareholders whose country of residence does not have a tax treaty with Israel granting tax relief to such shareholders from Israeli tax. See Item 10.E. “Taxation –\nTaxation and Government Programs – Israeli Tax Considerations and Government Programs”.\nOur private placement warrants are accounted for as liabilities, and the changes in value of our private placement warrants could impact our financial results.\nOn April 12, 2021, the Staff of the SEC issued a statement regarding the accounting and reporting considerations for warrants issued by special purpose acquisition companies\ntitled “Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (“SPACs”)” (the “SEC Statement”).\nThe SEC Statement focused on certain settlement terms and provisions related to certain tender offers following a business combination. The terms described in the SEC\nStatement are common in SPACs and are similar to the terms contained in the Warrant Agreement governing our warrants, which were originally issued by Collective Growth.\nFollowing the SEC Statement, we examined the accounting treatment of our public warrants and private placement warrants, and determined to classify the private placement\nwarrants as derivative liabilities measured at fair value, with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, while the public warrants are classified as equity.\nAs a result, included on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 contained elsewhere in this Annual Report are private placement warrants. Accounting Standards\nCodification 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), provides for the re-measurement of the fair value of such derivatives at each balance sheet date, with a resulting non-cash\ngain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recognized in earnings in the statement of operations. As a result of the recurring fair value measurement, our financial\nstatements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly based on factors which are outside of our control. Due to the recurring fair value measurement, we expect that we will\nrecognize non-cash gains or losses on our private placement warrants each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses could be material.\n22\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares, and we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation\nof our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends on our ordinary shares will be\nat the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable law, and would depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business\nconditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Consequently, you may be unable to realize a gain on your investment except by selling our ordinary\nshares after price appreciation, which may never occur.\nOur board of directors has sole discretion whether to pay dividends. If our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency, and amount will depend upon our\nfuture operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our directors may deem relevant. The\nCompanies Law imposes restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends. See the section titled “Description of our Ordinary Shares—Dividend and Liquidation Rights” in\nExhibit 2.1 of this Annual Report on Form 20-F for additional information. Payment of dividends may also be subject to Israeli withholding taxes. See Item 10.E. “Taxation –\nTaxation and Government Programs – Israeli Tax Considerations and Government Programs” for additional information.\nOur ordinary shares and warrants may not continue to be listed on a national securities exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in such\nsecurities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nWe may be unable to maintain the listing of our ordinary shares and warrants on Nasdaq in the future. If we fail to meet the listing requirements and Nasdaq does not list our\nordinary shares and warrants, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n• a limited availability of market quotations for our ordinary shares and warrants;\n• a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our ordinary shares and warrants;\n• a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for us;\n• a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; and\n• our securities would not be “covered securities” under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute that prevents or pre-\nempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, including securities listed on Nasdaq, in which case our securities would be subject to regulation in each\nstate where we offer and sells securities.\nThe market price and trading volume of our ordinary shares and warrants may be volatile and could decline significantly.\nNasdaq, the stock market on which our ordinary shares and warrants are listed under the symbols “INVZ,” and “INVZW,” respectively, have from time to time experienced\nsignificant price and volume fluctuations. Even if an active, liquid and orderly trading market is sustained for our ordinary shares and warrants, the market price of our ordinary\nshares and warrants may be volatile and could decline significantly. In addition, the trading volume in our ordinary shares and warrants may fluctuate and cause significant price\nvariations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of our ordinary shares and warrants will not fluctuate widely or decline significantly in the future in response to a\nnumber of factors, including, among others, the following:\n• the realization of any of the risk factors presented in this Annual Report;\n• actual or anticipated differences in our estimates, or in the estimates of analysts, for our revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, results of operations, level of indebtedness,\nliquidity or financial condition;\n• availability of capital to fund our contracts and our growth;\n• additions and departures of key personnel;\n• failure to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq;\n23\n• failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other laws or regulations;\n• future issuances, sales, resales or repurchases or anticipated issuances, sales, resales or repurchases, of our securities including due to the exercise of warrants;\n• publication of research reports about us;\n• the performance and market valuations of other similar companies;\n• failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow us or our failure to\nmeet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n• the effects of the war and hostilities between Israel and Hamas and Israel and Hezbollah;\n• the effects of our operational realignment;\n• new laws, regulations, subsidies, or credits or new interpretations of existing laws applicable to us;\n• commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n• broad disruptions in the financial markets, including sudden disruptions in the credit markets;\n• speculation in the press or investment community;\n• actual, potential or perceived control, accounting or reporting problems;\n• changes in accounting principles, policies and guidelines; and\n• other events or factors, including those resulting from infectious diseases, health epidemics and pandemics, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these\nevents.\nIn the past, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their shares. This type of litigation\ncould result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe expect our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which could cause the price of our ordinary shares and warrants to fluctuate or decline.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly in the future. As such, historical comparisons of our operating results may\nnot be meaningful. In the past, our sales were primarily to customers making purchases for research and development projects. Following our strategic transition to become a Tier 1\nautomotive supplier, non-recurring engineering or application engineering services (“NRE”) became another incremental source of revenue during the pre-production phase of the\nprograms. Additionally, in connection with our BMW L3 Program, we transitioned from selling full LiDAR units to selling components to Magna at lower average production sales\nprices, and recently began shipping production units for the first time in the company’s operating history. Therefore, sales in any given quarter can fluctuate based on the timing and\nsuccess of our customers’ programs and the stage of the program. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our\nquarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our\nbusiness. These fluctuations could adversely affect our ability to meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors. If we do not meet these expectations for any period,\nthe value of our business and our securities could decline significantly. Factors that may cause these quarterly or annual fluctuations include, without limitation, those listed below:\n• the timing and magnitude of orders and shipments of our products in any quarter;\n• the timing and magnitude of any NREs;\n• pricing changes we may adopt to drive market adoption or in response to competitive pressure;\n• our ability to attract and retain talent to develop, support, and promote our business across different functions and geographies;\n• our ability to retain our existing customers and attract new customers;\n• our ability to develop, introduce, manufacture and ship in a timely manner products that meet customer requirements;\n24\n• disruptions in our sales channels or termination of our relationship with important channel partners;\n• delays in customers’ purchasing cycles or deferments of customers’ purchases in anticipation of new products or updates from us or our competitors;\n• fluctuations in demand pressures for our products;\n• the mix of products sold in any quarter;\n• the timing and rate of broader market adoption of autonomous systems utilizing our solutions across the automotive and other market sectors;\n• market acceptance of LiDAR and further technological advancements by our competitors and other market participants;\n• the ability of our customers to commercialize systems that incorporate our products;\n• any change in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including consolidation of competitors, regulatory developments and new market entrants;\n• our ability to effectively manage our inventory;\n• changes in the source, cost, availability of and regulations pertaining to materials we use;\n• adverse litigation, judgments, settlements or other litigation-related costs, or claims that may give rise to such costs; and\n• general economic, industry and market conditions, including trade disputes.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our\nordinary shares and warrants adversely, or if we fail to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial guidance we publicly announce on a periodic basis, then the price and trading\nvolume of our ordinary shares and warrants could decline.\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares and warrants is influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not\ncontrol these analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. As a relatively new public company, analysts who publish information about our ordinary shares will have\nhad relatively little experience with us, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. If any of\nthe analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding us, the price of our ordinary shares and warrants could decline.\nIn addition, the share prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed,\nfinancial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts. If our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, the guidance we publicly\nannounce on a periodic basis or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our ordinary shares and warrants or publish unfavorable research about us\nand our securities. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn\ncould cause the price of our ordinary shares and warrants or trading volume to decline.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our securities.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may\ntake steps to delist our securities. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our ordinary shares and warrants and would impair our shareholders’ ability to\nsell or purchase our ordinary shares and warrants when they wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance\nwith listing requirements would allow our ordinary shares and warrants to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our ordinary shares and warrants,\nprevent our ordinary shares and warrants from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements.\n25\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements\navailable to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public\ncompanies.\nWe are eligible to be treated as an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012\n(the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised financial accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to\nprivate companies. We intend to take advantage of this extended transition period under the JOBS Act for adopting new or revised financial accounting standards.\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may also take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to\nother public companies that are not emerging growth companies, and not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information that they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although\ncircumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if our total annual gross revenue exceeds $1.235 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt\nsecurities during any three-year period, or if before that time we are a “large accelerated filer” under U.S. securities laws.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our ordinary shares and warrants less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our ordinary shares\nand warrants less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our ordinary shares and warrants and the price for our ordinary shares and warrants may be more\nvolatile. Further, there is no guarantee that the exemptions available to us under the JOBS Act will result in significant savings. To the extent that we choose not to use exemptions\nfrom various reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, we will incur additional compliance costs, which may impact our financial condition.\nWe are a foreign private issuer and, as a result, we are not subject to U.S. proxy rules and are subject to Exchange Act reporting obligations that, to some extent, are more\nlenient and less frequent than those of a U.S. domestic public company.\nWe report under the Exchange Act as a non-U.S. company with foreign private issuer status. Because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are\nexempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic public companies, including (1) the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation\nof proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act, (2) the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their\nshare ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time and (3) the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing\nwith the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q containing unaudited financial and other specified information, although we are subject to Israeli laws and regulations with regard to\nnotice of shareholder meetings and intends to furnish comparable quarterly financial information and proxy statements on Form 6-K. In addition, foreign private issuers are not\nrequired to file their annual report on Form 20-F until 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, while U.S. domestic issuers that are accelerated filers are required to file their annual\nreport on Form 10-K within 75 days after the end of each fiscal year and U.S. domestic issuers that are large accelerated filers are required to file their annual report on Form 10-\nK within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year. Foreign private issuers are also exempt from Regulation FD, which is intended to prevent issuers from making selective disclosures\nof material information. As a result of all of the above, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of a company that is not a foreign private issuer.\n26\nWe may lose our “foreign private issuer” status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses.\nWe are a foreign private issuer, and therefore we are not required to comply with all of the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The\ndetermination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and, accordingly, the next\ndetermination will be made with respect to us on June 30, 2024. In the future, we would lose our foreign private issuer status if (1) more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities\nare owned by U.S. residents and (2) a majority of our directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents, or we fail to meet additional requirements necessary to avoid loss\nof foreign private issuer status. If we lose our foreign private issuer status, we will be required to file with the SEC periodic reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic\nissuer forms, which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. We would also have to mandatorily comply with U.S. federal proxy\nrequirements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders will become subject to the short-swing profit disclosure and recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange\nAct. In addition, we would lose our ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements under the listing rules of Nasdaq. As a U.S. listed public\ncompany that is not a foreign private issuer, we would incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we will not incur as a foreign private issuer.\nAs we are a “foreign private issuer” and follow certain home country corporate governance practices, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to\nshareholders of companies that are subject to all Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\nAs a foreign private issuer, we have the option to follow certain home country corporate governance practices rather than those of Nasdaq, provided that we disclose the\nrequirements we are not following and describe the home country practice we are following. We rely on this “foreign private issuer exemption”, among others, with respect to the\nNasdaq rules for shareholder meeting quorums and Nasdaq rules requiring shareholder approval. We may in the future elect to follow home country practices with regard to other\nmatters. As a result, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\nRisks Related to Our Incorporation and Location in Israel\nThe war in Israel and other conditions in Israel could materially and adversely affect our business.\nMost of our employees, including certain management members, operate from our offices that are located in Rosh HaAin, Israel. In addition, most of our officers and directors\nare residents of Israel. Accordingly, political, economic, and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect our business and operations.\nIn October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Following the\nattacks, Israel declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against the terrorist organization commenced.\nIn addition, Hezbollah has also launched attacks against Israeli military sites and troops, and against Israeli towns in northern Israel. In response to these attacks, the Israel\nDefense Force (“IDF”) has carried out a number of targeted strikes on sites belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Further, Israel faces threats from more distant neighbors, in\nparticular, Iran which threatened to attack Israel, may be developing nuclear weapons and targeted cyber-attacks against Israeli entities; and the Houthi movement, which controls\nparts of Yemen and launched a number of attacks on marine vessels traversing the Red Sea. The Red Sea is a vital maritime route for international trade traveling to and from Israel.\nAs a result of such disruptions, we may experience in the future delays in supplier deliveries, extended lead times, and increased cost of freight, increased insurance costs, increased\npurchased materials and manufacturing labor costs. The risk of ongoing supply disruptions may result in delayed deliveries of our products and may also have adverse impact on\neconomic conditions in Israel.\nFurther, many Israeli citizens are obligated to perform up to several weeks of annual military reserve duty each year. Our operations could be disrupted by such call-\nups, which may include the call-up of members of our management. Since October 7, 2023, the IDF has called up more than 350,000 of its reserve forces to serve. A number of our\nmanagement and non-management employees are currently subject to military service in the IDF and many of them have been called to serve. In addition, the family members of\nmany of our Israeli team members are currently serving in the IDF. Such disruption could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n27\nThe intensity and duration of Israel’s current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, as are such war’s economic implications on our business and operations and on Israel's\neconomy in general. These events may be intertwined with wider macroeconomic indications of a deterioration of Israel’s economic standing, that may involve an additional\ndowngrade in Israel's credit rating by rating agencies (such as the recent downgrade by Moody’s of its credit rating of Israel from A1 to A2, as well as the downgrade of its outlook\nrating from “stable” to “negative”), which may have a material adverse effect on the company and its ability to effectively conduct its operations.\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism. Although the Israeli government currently covers the\nreinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained or that it will\nsufficiently cover our potential damages. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the\nregion would likely negatively affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations.\nFurther, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts. Several countries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with\nIsraeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or the expansion of our business. A campaign of\nboycotts, divestment, and sanctions has been undertaken against Israel, which could also adversely affect our business. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel or any\nnegative changes in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli economy and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and prospects.\nFinally, until the war started in October 2023, the current elected government in Israel was pursuing extensive reforms to Israel’s judicial system. Certain financial, legal and\ncommercial organizations and entities have claimed that such changes, if adopted, could adversely affect the macroeconomic condition in which we operate. At this stage, the\nproposed legislation has not become effective, and its scope has not been fully determined; we cannot assess the potential impacts of these changes and their likelihood on our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees, which could result in litigation and adversely affect\nour business.\nA significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment by us. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967 (the\n“Patent Law”), inventions conceived by an employee in the course and as a result of his or her employment with a company are regarded as “service inventions,” which belong to the\nemployer, absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights. The Patent Law also provides that if there is no such\nagreement between an employer and an employee, the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee (the “Royalties Committee”), a body constituted under the Patent Law, shall\ndetermine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her inventions. Case law clarifies that the right to receive consideration for “service inventions” can be waived\nby the employee and that in certain circumstances, such waiver does not necessarily have to be explicit. The Royalties Committee will examine, on a case-by-case basis, the general\ncontractual framework between the parties, using interpretation rules of the general Israeli contract laws. Further, the Royalties Committee has not yet determined one specific\nformula for calculating this remuneration, but rather uses the criteria specified in the Patent Law. Although we generally enter into assignment-of-invention agreements with our\nemployees pursuant to which such individuals assign to us all rights to any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement with us, we may face claims\ndemanding remuneration in consideration for assigned inventions. As a consequence of such claims, we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current\nand/or former employees, or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect our business.\nThe tax benefits that are available to us require that we continue to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which could increase our\ncosts and taxes.\nWe may be eligible for certain tax benefits provided to “Preferred Technology Enterprises” under the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959 (the\n“Investment Law”). In order to remain eligible for the tax benefits for “Preferred Technology Enterprises” we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the Investment\nLaw and our regulations, as amended. If these tax benefits are reduced, cancelled or discontinued, our Israeli taxable income from the approved enterprise would be subject to regular\nIsraeli corporate tax rates. The standard corporate tax rate for Israeli companies in 2016 was 25% of their taxable income and was reduced to 24% in 2017 and 23% in 2018 and\nthereafter. Additionally, if we increase our activities outside of Israel through acquisitions, for example, our expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in future Israeli tax\nbenefit programs. See Item 10.E. “Taxation – Taxation and Government Programs – Israeli Tax Considerations and Government Programs”.\n28\nIt may be difficult to enforce a U.S. judgment against us, our officers and directors and the Israeli experts named in this Annual Report in Israel or the United States, or to\nassert U.S. securities laws claims in Israel or serve process on our officers and directors and these experts.\nMost of our directors or officers are not residents of the United States and most of their and our assets are located outside the United States. Service of process upon us or\nour non-U.S. resident directors and officers and enforcement of judgments obtained in the United States against us or our non-U.S. our directors and executive officers may be\ndifficult to obtain within the United States. It may be difficult to assert claims under U.S. securities laws in original actions instituted in Israel or obtain a judgment based on the civil\nliability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws against us or our non-U.S. officers and\ndirectors because Israel may not be the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and\nnot U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly\nprocess. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel addressing the matters described above. Israeli courts might not\nenforce judgments rendered outside Israel, which may make it difficult to collect on judgments rendered against us or our non-U.S. officers and directors. In addition, there is no\nbilateral treaty between Israel and the United States for the enforcement of civil judgments.\nMoreover, among other reasons, including but not limited to, fraud or absence of due process, or the existence of a judgment which is at variance with another judgment that\nwas given in the same matter or if a suit in the same matter between the same parties was pending before a court or tribunal in Israel, an Israeli court will not enforce a non-\nIsraeli judgment if it was given in a state whose laws do not provide for the enforcement of judgments of Israeli courts (subject to exceptional cases) or if our enforcement is likely to\nprejudice the sovereignty or security of the State of Israel.\nThe rights and responsibilities of our shareholders are governed by Israeli law, which may differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders of\nU.S. corporations.\nWe are incorporated under Israeli law. The rights and responsibilities of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by our Articles and the Companies Law. These rights and\nresponsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in typical U.S. corporations. In particular, pursuant to the Companies Law each shareholder\nof an Israeli company has to act in good faith in exercising his or her rights and fulfilling his or her obligations toward the company and other shareholders and to refrain from\nabusing his or her power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders and class meetings, on amendments to a company’s articles\nof association, increases in a company’s authorized share capital, mergers, and transactions requiring shareholders’ approval under the Companies Law. In addition, a controlling\nshareholder of an Israeli company or a shareholder who knows that it possesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote or who has the power to appoint or prevent\nthe appointment of a director or officer in the company or has other powers toward the company has a duty of fairness toward the company. However, Israeli law does not define the\nsubstance of this duty of fairness. There is limited case law available to assist in understanding the implications of these provisions that govern shareholder behavior.\nU.S. holders of our ordinary shares and/or warrants may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are treated as a passive foreign investment company.\nA non-U.S. corporation generally will be treated as a “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in any taxable year if either (1) at\nleast 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income (such as interest income) or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the\nassets) during such year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. We believe we were a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31,\n2023. However, as discussed below, whether we were a PFIC for any given taxable year is based on a complex and factual determination and there is no assurance that the Internal\nRevenue Service (“IRS”) will agree with our determination. Based on the current and anticipated composition of the income, assets and operations of our company and our\nsubsidiaries, we cannot be sure as to whether we will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ending December 31, 2024 or in future taxable years.\nMoreover, because PFIC status is based on our income, assets and activities for the entire taxable year, it is not possible to determine whether we will be characterized as a PFIC for\nour current taxable year or future taxable years until after the close of the applicable taxable year. This is an annual factual determination that depends on, among other things, the\ncomposition of our income (including the relative size of our gross operating loss and our passive income) and assets, and the market value of our shares and assets (including\nunbooked goodwill), including the composition of income and assets and the market value of shares or assets, as applicable, of our subsidiaries, from time to time, and thus a\ndetermination can only be made annually after the close of each taxable year. Moreover, the value of our assets (including unbooked goodwill) for purposes of the PFIC\ndetermination may be determined by reference to the trading value of our ordinary shares, which could fluctuate significantly. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. Holder (as\ndefined below under “Taxation – United States Federal Income Taxation”) of our ordinary shares may be subject to adverse tax consequences and may incur certain information\nreporting obligations. Under the PFIC rules, unless such U.S. Holder makes an election available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (which election\ncould itself have adverse consequences for such U.S. Holder), such U.S. Holder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the then prevailing maximum rates on ordinary income\nand possibly an “interest” charge, in respect of “excess distributions” and upon any gain from the disposition of our ordinary shares, as if the excess distribution or gain had been\nrecognized ratably over such U.S. Holder’s holding period of our ordinary shares. Certain elections (including a qualified electing fund or a mark-to-market election) may be\navailable to U.S. Holders of our ordinary shares to mitigate some of the adverse tax consequences resulting from PFIC treatment, however, are not available with respect to the\nwarrants. For a further discussion, see “Taxation—United States Federal Income Taxation—Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations.”\nU.S. Holders of our ordinary shares and warrants are strongly encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to us and the\nownership of our ordinary shares and/or our warrants.\n29\nIf a United States person is treated as owning at least 10% of our shares, such person may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nIf a United States person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly or constructively) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our shares, such person may be treated as a\n“United States shareholder” with respect to us and any of our direct and indirect foreign affiliates (“Innoviz Group”) that is a “controlled foreign corporation” as defined in Section\n957 of the Code. Because the Innoviz Group includes one or more U.S. subsidiaries, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be treated as controlled foreign corporations regardless\nof whether we are treated as a controlled foreign corporation.\nA United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to report annually and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of the controlled\nforeign corporation’s “Subpart F income” and, in computing its “global intangible low-taxed income,” “tested income” and a pro rata share of the amount of U.S. property (including\ncertain stock in U.S. corporations and certain tangible assets located in the United States) held by the controlled foreign corporation regardless of whether such controlled foreign\ncorporation makes any distributions. The amount includable by a United States shareholder under these rules is based on a number of factors, including potentially, but not limited to,\nthe controlled foreign corporation’s current earnings and profits (if any), tax basis in the controlled foreign corporation’s assets, and foreign taxes paid by the controlled foreign\ncorporation on its underlying income. Failure to comply with these reporting obligations (or related tax payment obligations) may subject such United States shareholder to\nsignificant monetary penalties and may prevent the statute of limitations with respect to such United States shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax return for the year for which\nreporting (or payment of tax) was due from starting. An individual that is a United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation generally would not be allowed\ncertain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a United States shareholder that is a U.S. corporation. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist\nholders in determining whether any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or whether any holder is treated as a United States shareholder with\nrespect to any of such controlled foreign corporations or furnish to any holder information that may be necessary to comply with reporting and tax paying obligations.\nU.S. Holders of our ordinary shares and/or warrants are strongly encouraged to consult their own advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to us and the\nownership of our ordinary shares and/or warrants.\nItem 4. Information on the Company.\nA. History and Development of the Company\nWe were incorporated in Israel on January 18, 2016 under the Companies Law, and our principal executive office is located at 5 Uri Ariav St., Building C, Rosh HaAin\n4809202, Israel. Our legal and commercial name is Innoviz Technologies Ltd. We are registered with the Israeli Registrar of Companies. Our registration number is 51-538242-2. Our\nwebsite address is https://innoviz.tech/, and our telephone number is +972-74-700-3692. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute a\npart of this Annual Report and is not incorporated by reference herein. We have included our website address in this Annual Report solely for informational purposes. The SEC\nmaintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as Innoviz, that file electronically, with the SEC at\nwww.sec.gov. Our agent for service of process in the United States is Cogency Global Inc., 122 East 42nd Street, 18th Floor, New York, NY 10168.\n30\nOn December 10, 2020, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with Collective Growth, Perception, Antara Capital and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Business\nCombination Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Collective Growth, with Collective Growth surviving the merger. Upon consummation of the Business Combination and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement on April 5, 2021, Collective Growth became a wholly owned subsidiary of us.\nFor a description of our principal capital expenditures and divestitures for the three years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, see Item 5. “Operating and Financial\nReview and Prospects.”\nB. Business Overview\nRecent Developments\nStrategic Realignment\nOn January 31, 2024, we announced a strategic realignment of our operations to expand our cash runway and optimize our path towards profitability and free cash flow\ngeneration, which included a reduction in the company’s headcount by approximately 13% during the first quarter of 2024.\nSince 2021, we have funded the development of two production path programs: the InnovizOne and InnovizTwo LiDAR sensor and perception software suites. With the\nInnovizOne program now transitioned from the development phase into full series production, we are eliminating duplicative cost structures and significantly reduce spending on\nInnovizOne development, while reinvesting a portion of the savings into the InnovizTwo sensor and perception software platform. All quoting and bidding activity in our request for\ninformation and request for quotation pipeline will now be focused on the InnovizTwo platform.\nAppointment of Avishay Moscovici\nOn February 28, 2024, we announced the appointment of Mr. Avishay Moscovici as the Company’s new Chief R&D Officer. Mr. Moscovici replaces Mr. Oren Buskila, who\nhas stepped down as Chief R&D Officer to pursue a new opportunity outside of the LiDAR industry.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a leading Tier-1 direct supplier of high-performance, automotive grade LiDAR sensors and perception software that feature technological breakthroughs across core\ncomponents and bring enhanced vision and superior performance to enable safe autonomous driving at a mass scale. We believe that we provide a complete and comprehensive\nsolution for OEMs and Tier-1 partners that are developing and marketing autonomous driving vehicles to the passenger car and other relevant markets, such as robotaxis, shuttles,\ndelivery vehicles and trucks.\nWe were founded in 2016 by veterans of Unit 81, the elite technology unit of Israel’s Intelligence Corps, one of the most prestigious multidisciplinary technological units in the\nIDF. From our founding, our culture drew from Unit 81’s core values of solving sophisticated technological problems through creativity and agile thinking. We have relied on these\nvalues to address the needs of autonomous vehicles in a manner that strikes the desired balance between performance and cost. We created a new type of LiDAR sensor from the\nchip-level up, including a suite of powerful and sophisticated software applications for high-performance computer vision to allow superior perception. Our multidisciplinary team\ndeveloped an operational MEMS-based (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) LiDAR prototype, which attracted the attention of leading Tier-1 companies such as Magna and Aptiv\nPLC as early as 2017. This was followed by a further intensive development and qualification stage, which culminated with our company achieving a design win with BMW in 2018\nto power BMW’s Level 3 autonomous platform.\nDuring 2022, we made the major strategic decision to become a Tier-1 direct supplier of LiDAR to the automotive industry. This decision allows us to have direct technical\ndiscussions with customers and to improve pricing to automotive OEMs with the goal of continuing to strengthen our position in the automotive market. This strategic decision has\nalready played a significant role in our major OEM program wins since, as discussed below.\nIn 2022, following more than two years of extensive diligence and qualification, we were selected by Volkswagen as its direct LiDAR supplier for automated vehicles within the\nVolkswagen brands with our InnovizTwo next generation high-performance automotive-grade LiDAR sensor. Later in 2022, an Asia-based automotive OEM selected us to serve as\nits direct LiDAR supplier for series production passenger vehicles. BMW and Volkswagen are leaders in deploying new technologies into the automotive industry. We believe that\nour close cooperation with these OEMs uniquely positions us to make Level 3 autonomous driving a commercial reality.\n31\nIn 2023, we announced that Volkswagen aims to expand its use of our InnovizTwo LiDAR to its existing light commercial vehicle program. In addition, we announced that we\nwere beginning a B-sample development phase on a new generation of LiDAR for BMW Group. Under the development agreement, we developed B-samples based on our second\ngeneration InnovizTwo LiDAR sensor.\nThe sustained cooperation with our customers provides our engineers and other research and development personnel with a valuable competitive edge. These engineers and\nother research and development personnel have been meticulously trained to design, operate, and verify our many ground-breaking innovations in accordance and in compliance with\nthe rigorous ISO26262 standard for Functional Safety in the automotive industry. Compliance with this and other standards have been enforced by regular ongoing audits of Innoviz\nand rigorous testing by our key suppliers, existing customers and prospective customers that thoroughly review the performance of various elements of our operations. As a result,\nour products have been constructed from the bottom up with hardware and software technology that meets the most stringent automotive safety, quality, environmental,\nmanufacturing, and other standards.\nOur innovation has produced LiDAR solutions that deliver market leading performance and that meet the current demanding safety requirements for Level 2+ through Level 5\nautonomous vehicles at price points suitable for mass produced passenger vehicles. Our integrated custom design of advanced hardware and software components, which leverages\nthe multidisciplinary expertise and experience of our team, enables us to provide turn-key autonomous solutions that are likely to accelerate widespread adoption across automakers\nat serial production scale.\nOur robust software suite enables our ~905nm wavelength laser-based LiDAR architecture to be easily leveraged to provide compelling solutions for Level 2+ through Level 4\n(and Level 5 when applicable). This means that we are positioned to penetrate the current market, which is focused primarily on Level 2+ (with some Level 3 production), and to\ncontinue to capture and extend our market share to Levels 3 through 5 as the market continues to mature.\nWe are currently expanding our third-party manufacturing capacity through contract manufacturers to meet an anticipated increase in customer demand for our products, while\nalso further developing a next generation high-performance automotive-grade LiDAR sensor, the InnovizTwo, that is expected to provide further cost efficiencies, while enabling\neven higher performance solutions for vehicles offering driving automations levels of Level 2+ and above.\nGeographically, the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from customers in Europe and North America. As we continue to grow, we expect to generate additional\nrevenue from existing and other geographic areas and the geographic mix of our revenue could therefore change over time.\nMarket Outlook\nThe automotive industry is increasingly harnessing sophisticated technologies in its push to develop and introduce autonomous driving vehicles. Significant investment and\nrapid growth in this industry are being driven by the need to assure human safety and in parallel, the potential recapture of drivers’ time for work, rest and relaxation while the vehicle\ndrives itself. The technologies and products needed for autonomous driving require long development and validation cycles and must ensure safety of the autonomous systems prior\nto commercial deployment.\nRecognizing the different levels of innovation and autonomy and the need to standardize the approaches across the spectrum of possibilities for the sake of safety, the Society\nof Automotive Engineers has developed and defined six levels of automation for autonomous vehicles: Level 0 through Level 5. These levels have been adopted by the U.S.\nDepartment of Transportation.\n32\nLevels of Autonomous Driving\nLevel 0: The driver is fully responsible for all driving functions at all times, even when the driver’s feet are off the pedals or if there is no steering. The driver must constantly\nsupervise his or her environment, steer the vehicle and brake or accelerate as needed to maintain safety. In Level 0, the driver assistance features are limited to providing warnings or\nmomentary driving assistance, such as forward collision warning, blind spot warning and lane departure warning.\nLevel 1: Includes driver assistance features such as Automated Emergency Braking Systems, steering or brake/acceleration, lane keep assist or lane centering, or adaptive\ncruise control.\nLevel 2: Includes partially automated driver assistance features that provide steering and brake/acceleration support to the driver, such as lane centering and adaptive cruise\ncontrol at the same time. The term L2+ or Level 2+ is used for higher capability systems that will allow the driver to remove their hands from the wheel for certain periods of time,\nbut the driver’s eyes must remain on the road. Level 2 represents the highest level in which the driver is still fully responsible for all driving functions at all times.\nLevel 3: In this level, the vehicle can still be operated in normal driving mode. However, when the automated driving function is engaged, the human is no longer responsible\nfor the driving function, even when seated in the driver’s seat. The vehicle drives in conditional automation mode, and when the vehicle stops the automated driving, the driver must\ntake back complete control, and resume driving. The vehicle will drive in automated mode only under limited conditions and will not operate unless all the required conditions are\nmet – for example, driving on specific roads, under favorable weather conditions or below a specific driving speed.\nLevel 4: Assures the vehicle will continue to function without any human driver intervention, even if in a degraded state, and the driver may have the option to control the\nvehicle. Pedals and/or steering wheel may or may not be installed.\nLevel 5: Full automation. The vehicle is capable of performing all driving functions under all conditions without human intervention or even occupants.\nIn addition to these six levels, certain industry participants have also identified a gap between Level 2 and Level 3, which it calls Level 2+. The move from Level 2 to Level 3 is\nessentially the crossover from driver-assist to some level of autonomy. In the jump between these two levels, it is expected that liability will shift from the driver to the system,\nmeaning that responsibility and liability for driving is shifted from the driver to the OEM. This gap can be partially bridged by systems that offer more than Level 2 but less than\nLevel 3, or an enhanced ADAS offering, which has created the industry terminology of “Level 2+”.\nCurrently, ADAS, or Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, which are not considered “autonomous driving” but have important active safety features, have been successfully\ncommercialized. ADAS-equipped vehicles are not fully autonomous as, although the vehicle can control both steering and acceleration/deceleration, a human sits in the driver’s seat\nand needs to monitor the driving at all times (i.e., have “eyes on the road”). Therefore, the advancement from vehicles with ADAS (Levels 1 through 2+) to autonomous driving\nsystems (Levels 3 through 5) requires “environmental detection” capabilities, or the capability to detect the environment in which the vehicle is operating, including speed, weather,\ndensity of traffic and every other condition that affects driving decisions. Autonomous driving systems also require high-definition maps, a highway or urban setting, and the ability\nfor the system to make informed decisions independently, without the need for human supervision.\nThe ADAS+/ Level 2+ segment of the consumer automotive market is expected to grow significantly over the short to medium term. ADAS+/Level 2+ systems are still\ntechnically in the driver-assist realm but incorporate a whole new layer of functionality on top of the traditional ADAS features. For instance, in Level 2+ vehicles, map data may\nenable lane-centering functions to remain effective even in areas where sensing-only lane centering systems may face difficulties, such as in areas without visible lane marks or low-\nquality lane markings, ramps with sharp turns, junctions, roundabouts, newly paved roads or urban settings. Level 2+ also supports automatic lane changes by providing information\nsuch as lane-marking types and adjusting the drive speed according to road speed/curvature.\nIn Level 3 through Level 5 autonomous vehicles, the system is expected to take on the full task of driving, either in defined-use cases (Level 3 and Level 4) or all use cases\n(Level 5). Accordingly, the OEM is defined as the legal driver, retains full responsibility and the autonomous vehicle system must comply with the highest level of functional safety\n(ISO26262 ASIL D). This is to guarantee a failure probability low enough that automakers, consumers and regulators will be able to agree that the vehicle can handle driving without\nany supervision by a human driver in given areas and at given times. Level 3 through Level 5 systems accordingly require a robust sensing suite, which necessitates the use of high-\nperformance LiDAR sensors. High performance LiDAR sensors were initially too expensive for mass market applications. However, our products feature reliability, automotive-\ngrade assurance, low cost and distributed sensing advantages and we believe our products are well-positioned to achieve widespread deployment in this segment.\n33\nBeyond the autonomous driving industry, there exist numerous other applications in which a high-performance automotive-grade LiDAR with wide operating range and high\nreliability can add significant value. For example, numerous off-highway driving applications significantly benefit from the safety features available with use of LiDAR solutions.\nThese include the mining and construction industries, ports and airports, and material handling in factories, all of which deploy vehicles and machines in restricted environments, at\nlow speeds, and which require autonomous driving not only for cost saving, but also to prevent costly accidents caused by distracted drivers. The major applications currently\nrelevant to our company beyond autonomous driving are:\nOur LiDAR Applications in Shuttles and Robotaxis\nThe automated shuttle business model is reliant on full autonomy. Shuttles drive repetitively over the same, well mapped (“geo-fenced”) routes, with the possibility of software\norchestration for specific difficulties, such as a high-traffic intersection.\nSimilarly, the robotaxi business model is also reliant on full autonomy. However, similar to human-driven taxis, robotaxis travel on constantly changing routes with\ndynamic pick-up and drop-off locations for passengers that order the robotaxi service. This more complex and dynamic driving environment makes the autonomy challenge for\nrobotaxis harder to solve compared to that of shuttles. Nevertheless, the use-case is compelling as it will drive costs for passengers down to a small part of the current taxi price, when\ntaking into account the elimination of drivers, increased safety, and other savings.\nIn both shuttles and robotaxis, autonomy calls for a comprehensive sensor suite that has 360-degree surround-perception in the most trying circumstances, including busy city\nstreets with pedestrians, dogs, bicycles, erratic traffic behavior, construction sites and others. Sensors need to be precise in regard to location and timing, see all around the vehicle\nand detect obstacles at various heights with minimal delay. In addition, localization is needed to locate the shuttle or robotaxi precisely, to leverage high-definition maps.\nOur LiDAR is uniquely suited to the shuttle and robotaxi applications. By deploying LiDARs around the perimeter of the vehicle, shuttle and robotaxi designers can avoid both\nocclusion and blind spots. Just as a human driver would cautiously move forward to peek around the truck, software can creep, allowing a corner mounted LiDAR to see over the\nintersection and decide to go around the truck when traffic is clear.\nOur LiDAR Applications in Trucks\nFully autonomous trucks may weigh 20-tons or more and have a stopping distance of several hundred meters. Full autonomy in this space is not only dependent on long-range\nsensors, but also on advanced and validated software that has to be proved to work at highway speed. This is further complicated by traffic diversions, construction and debris on the\nfreeway, accident sites, traffic cones and other common highway occurrences. Development of fully autonomous trucks is supported by our current LiDARs.\nIn addition to the application of a fully autonomous truck driving alone, LiDAR sensors can enable a platoon of leader-follower trucks, where the lead vehicle has a human\ndriver, and the follower vehicles are autonomous. For this application, LiDAR sensors are critical in maintaining distance between leader and follower(s). A gap will allow other\nvehicles to cut-in, disturbing the truck platoon formation. The 3 cm precision our LiDARs bring to range sensing allows a tight platoon to drive at highway speed with safety.\nOur Technological Differentiation\nIndustry Approaches and Their Limitations\nThe first level of automation that requires sensors beyond radars or cameras is Level 2. Level 2 autonomous vehicles use cameras and radars as the sensors for making\nactuation decisions for the vehicle (changes in car speed and trajectory). However, the driver is essential to meet functional safety targets. The driver is used as a second observer to\nthe camera and is expected to keep his or her eyes on the road so that he or she can take over in case the car’s driving decision-making system makes an error.\nA system which complies with the highest level of functional safety (ISO26262 ASIL D) requires the “smart” redundancy of critical elements. The sensor suite is defined as a\ncritical part of the autonomous driving system, as it is not possible to make correct driving decisions without an accurate understanding of the vehicle’s surroundings. “Smart”\nredundancy does not mean multiplying the same sensors to deal with sensor malfunction, but rather adding different types of sensors to ensure that, in any given situation where\nconditions are challenging for certain types of sensors, other sensors will perform well and enable correct driving decision-making. Ideally, sensors should complement each other.\n34\nCameras and radars are ubiquitous today. Both have advantages for use in ADAS and autonomous driving applications, and both are relatively mature technologies with price\npoints that are accessible for almost all new cars. Nevertheless, cameras and radars have known disadvantages that make them inadequate for use in Level 3 through Level 5 systems\nwithout a LiDAR. In addition, even Level 2 ADAS systems, which are not considered “autonomous driving” but have important active safety features, can greatly benefit from the\naddition of LiDARs for detecting and classifying objects and making emergency decisions to avoid accidents. This is especially true of Level 2+ systems offering enhanced ADAS\nthat can empower pseudo-autonomy, such as hands-free highway driving where the driver still retains primary responsibility. This trend will likely be driven by lower cost LiDAR\nsystems.\nCamera-based ADAS systems rely heavily on perception software, as the sensor itself provides 2D data that requires perception algorithms in order to translate the data into a\n3D perception model of the road. The ability of cameras to detect range is limited since 2D information does not include a measurement of range. Although range can be deduced\nfrom a 2D picture using perception algorithms, that process has limited accuracy. Furthermore, camera performance is limited under low-lighting situations, especially at night, and\nduring sudden exposure to extreme light, and its performance is limited by challenging weather conditions such as rain.\nRadar, on the other hand, is limited by its low angular resolution compared to other sensors such as camera or LiDAR. For example, radar may have difficulty differentiating\nbetween reflections from a car that is 50 meters away, the road below it, the fence next to it or a parked car along the way. It may also have issues distinguishing objects that are close\ntogether, determining object size and shape, and detecting lateral motion, such as a person walking laterally in front of a car.\nReal life road conditions may present autonomous vehicles with objects, or a combination of objects, that the vehicles’ perception algorithms are not able to classify, as every\nperception algorithm is only designed to support a limited set of object classes. The value of having a LiDAR as part of the vehicle’s sensing suite in this situation is that the LiDAR\nprovides a physical measurement in a high-resolution 3D representation of the driving scene. The perception software layer can then use this 3D representation to determine the\nexistence of an object in the driving path of the vehicle, without the need to classify the type of object. Therefore, safe driving can be maintained.\nMost LiDAR lasers work at either around ~905nm or ~1550nm wavelengths. The choice of wavelength impacts, among other things, the type of laser and optical detector used\nin the system, which are two of the main components that influence performance, cost and power consumption of the LiDAR. ~1550nm wavelength LiDAR lasers can potentially\nsend stronger light pulses than ~905nm wavelength LiDAR lasers while still maintaining eye-safety limitations and therefore provide longer range measurements than ~905nm lasers,\nbut certain factors prevent them from being as cost or energy efficient as ~905nm wavelength-based systems. Specifically, ~1550nm based systems may use fiber-coupled lasers that\nare significantly more expensive than the diode lasers used with ~905nm wavelength-based systems. Furthermore, deploying the higher peak optical power used in ~1550nm systems\nmay consume more electrical power than that used by ~905nm systems, which also causes the LiDAR to heat up considerably. This is a critical physical limitation, especially when\nmany new cars are electric cars. Since electrical-to-optical power conversion efficiency is similar at both wavelengths, ~1550nm systems generally require more electrical power than\n~905nm systems. The increased power consumption may also lead to a greater burden on the car’s electric power supply (which is an important factor, especially for electric\nvehicles) and to size and form factor issues, as it takes a larger mechanical design to manage heat dissipation. Larger components are also harder to fit on the outside of the car from a\ndesign perspective. In addition, as silicon detectors cannot detect ~1550nm light efficiently, the detectors for a ~1550nm LiDAR often include compounds such as indium gallium\narsenide which are more expensive to source and manufacture relative to silicon, which is ubiquitous in ~905nm detectors.\nOur Technological Approach\nRecognizing the limitations on the use of ~1550nm lasers in the automotive industry, we have, from our inception, focused on the development of a commercially viable\nLiDAR solution that utilizes an eye-safe ~905nm-based laser designed to outperform more expensive ~1550nm based LiDARs.\nIn order to minimize the performance limitations resulting from the stricter eye-safety limitations of ~905nm wavelength lasers compared to ~1550nm wavelength lasers, we\nhave used a multidisciplinary approach to design the key system components from the ground up, including:\n• unique scanning mechanisms for improved scanner size and better collection of received light;\n• silicon detectors for improved optical–electrical conversion of the received signal; and\n• the signal processing application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) (the chip that processes the signal coming from the detectors and controls the system functions) in\norder to improve the optical link budget of the system, while also getting the best possible detection capabilities for a given optical link budget. We have achieved\nindustry leading point-cloud quality by developing and using custom signal processing algorithms implemented in a proprietary ASIC.\n35\nThe integration of MEMS-based and other unique scanning mechanisms in the LiDAR reduces form-factor and improves robustness. The reduced form-factor allows our\nLiDAR to be deployed around the perimeter of the autonomous vehicle, thereby reducing blind spots and improving efficacy of perception in a manner that is consistent with higher\nlevels of autonomy.\nInnovizOne, featuring a form factor of 0.5 liters and weight of 0.5 kilograms, is capable of beaming laser signals off obstacles as far as 250 meters away. The signals are then\ncollected in a high sensitivity detector and processed by advanced analog and digital circuits in an ASIC. Each of these is custom designed by us. Each reflection represents a point,\nor reflection of an individual laser beam. A scanner deflects the laser to scan the field of view (“FOV”). The time-of-flight of each reflection, or point, is measured to yield distance\nand reflectivity information. The accumulation of all the points in the FOV results in a point-cloud that is transmitted from the LiDAR. Based on the speed of light, the time-of-\nflight measurement provides an accurate 3D representation of all objects and obstacles in the FOV.\nInnovizTwo featuring a unique technology that is distinct from InnovizOne. The primary target market for InnovizTwo is automotive customers as it provides scalability and\nexpansion to offer LiDAR capabilities across different automotive segments, while building on lessons learned and synergistic advantages which Innoviz has gained through its\nhistorical creation of products, including InnovizOne.\nIn addition to its unique hardware solutions, Innoviz’s LiDAR solutions include a unique perception software application that turns raw point cloud data from Innoviz LiDAR\nproducts into perception outputs. The outputs can serve as a standalone, functionally safe perception software, or can be integrated into the vehicle’s existing perception stack at\ndifferent levels to support various sensor fusion architectures. Our software leverages the rich data derived from our LiDAR products, coupled with proprietary state-of-the-\nart artificial intelligence-based algorithms, to provide superior scene perception and deliver an automotive-grade ASIL B(D) solution.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and will enable us to successfully compete in our target markets to maintain our leadership\nposition.\nCost and energy efficient high performance LiDAR solutions. Tier-1 manufacturers and automakers are extremely sensitive to the cost of any component in the vehicle, and\nespecially to relatively high-priced individual components such as LiDAR sensors. They demand competitive prices and put significant weight on this parameter when deciding on\nvendors. Because we identified these requirements in the development of our original solution architecture, we chose to use ~905nm wavelength lasers, which work with diode lasers.\nThese are much more affordable than the lasers required by ~1550nm wavelength LiDAR lasers that often include compounds such as indium gallium arsenide, which is more\nexpensive to source and manufacture than the silicon used in ~905nm wavelength lasers. ~905nm wavelength lasers also use less power than ~1550nm lasers. Autonomous vehicles\nbenefit from this lower power consumption because it increases vehicle driving range (primarily in electric vehicles). In addition, ~1550nm lasers generate more heat than ~905nm\nlasers, which requires a larger size to allow for more heat dissipation. A larger form factor presents design challenges to automakers as consumer vehicles have limited mounting\nspace with good visibility of the vehicle’s surroundings. Accordingly, our ~905nm wavelength laser-based LiDAR solution offers a compelling price point, lower power consumption\nand a smaller form factor than other market participants, without sacrifice in performance.\nAutomotive grade development and production. Vehicle components, particularly parts of the autonomous vehicle driving technology system, are required to have a high\nfunctional safety grade. Achieving compliance with functional safety standards, such as ISO26262, is a time consuming and labor-intensive process that requires significant\ncooperation with automotive grade industry participants, such as Tier-1 suppliers and automobile manufacturers. Starting in 2017, we have worked closely with leading Tier-\n1 suppliers such as Magna and its automaker partner, BMW, to develop a LiDAR solution that meets these stringent requirements. This process has included continuous and extensive\nproduct-safety auditing by BMW and Magna, as well as additional review by other leading participants in the industry. As a result of our close work with these partners, we have\ndeveloped rigorous safety and quality expertise. This gives us a significant advantage over competitors that have focused on technology development without having design wins\nwith major automotive customers such as BMW or partnerships with major automotive Tier-1 suppliers early in their development process. These competitors will be required by\nconsumer automotive OEMs and/or Tier-1 suppliers to undergo automotive-grade certifications that can take up to a few years to achieve, prior to entering the market.\n36\nMultiple Tier-1 partners enabling market penetration. OEMs design their future models and vehicles several years in advance and often then freeze the design to produce and\ndeliver the vehicles on time. Therefore, designs for mass-production Level 3 and Level 4 consumer car programs planned for 2026-2028 are expected to be decided during 2024.\nLiDAR solutions that will be candidates for inclusion in these programs must go through the process of automotive-grade manufacturing and audit by the OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers.\nWe believe that our Tier-1 and OEM tested technology, increases our chances of both winning upcoming OEM Request for Quotes (“RFQs”), and being invited to RFQs given that\ncompanies without these market credentials and certifications will not be eligible for inclusion in RFQ tenders.\nFlexible Tier-1 / Tier-2 engagement model. We leverage our in-house knowledge developed through our engagement and development history to approach customers directly.\nThis has enabled us to offer additional customization and more direct OEM positioning and engagement, which in turn has allowed us to offer customers better commercial terms,\ncommitments and end-customer support and collaboration. The multi-faceted customer engagement approach (via Tier-1s as a Tier-2 and direct as a Tier-1) allows us to cover a wide\nrange of customers and partners to further increase our market reach.\nComprehensive intellectual property portfolio and multidisciplinary R&D organization. Our architecture has focused on developing a full LiDAR autonomous driving solution\nthat utilizes a ~905nm wavelength laser. In order to break through the performance limitations resulting from lower peak optical power, we have used a multi-disciplinary approach to\ndesign all of the system components from scratch: the scanner, silicon detectors and the signal processing ASIC, in order to improve the optical link budget of the system, while\ngetting the best possible detection capabilities for a given optical link budget. This approach has yielded a broad range of intellectual property that we believe gives us a significant\ncompetitive advantage, as it will make it difficult for other market participants to successfully develop and commercialize cost and energy efficient LiDAR solutions utilizing\n~905nm wavelength lasers. We currently hold a number of key patents, including a LiDAR patent related to surround view LiDAR design, which we believe is fundamental. In\naddition to our ~905nm wavelength laser-based LiDAR architecture, we also have a powerful standalone software suite that gives us industry-leading perception capabilities. We\nbelieve that the ability of our research and development team to innovate in many disciplines, across hardware, software, optics and others, provides us with a strong standing for\nfuture competition.\nFlexible System Configuration and Powerful Perception Capabilities\nMarket leading perception capabilities. Since our founding, we have adopted a holistic approach to the production of a LiDAR system, including the development of a\nproprietary standalone software suite. The system features can achieve up to uniform high resolution of 0.05°x0.05° across the FOV as opposed to some competing systems, in which\nresolution is always qualified by operating conditions such as frame rate and a limited FOV. Flexible, software-controlled features such as the Region of Interest (ROI), Pixel\nSummation (PSM), variable vertical field of view and software selectable frame rate further enhance the performance of the point-cloud. This high-performance time-of-flight point-\ncloud output is augmented by vision processing algorithms to create a comprehensive LiDAR perception system.\nAgile system configuration. Our system design allows dynamic configuration of various system functions, such as laser power, scanning pattern and frame rate. This flexibility\nallows us to offer different product configurations based on the same hardware with only software modification. This allows us to address multiple market needs and niches without\nneeding to develop several hardware configurations, a process that would be costly due to the need for additional design, production, validation and support. The ability of the car\ncomputer to optimize our LiDAR to its real time surroundings is another unique advantage made possible by this system design. For example, when driving on a highway, a forward-\nfocused configuration with narrow FOV and an extended range is desired, while in an urban scenario, a uniform, wide FOV is desired and nominal range is acceptable in order to\nlower power dissipation.\nGrowth Strategy\nDrive increased adoption through lower cost products. Our entire approach and solution architecture focuses on using ~905nm wavelength lasers, which allow for significantly\nmore affordable solutions than ~1550nm wavelength laser-based LiDARs. We intend to continue to focus on refining our architecture and component engineering in order to produce\nLiDAR solutions that feature even more attractive pricing than our initial product, the InnovizOne. Our InnovizTwo features costs and pricing that are significantly lower than those\nof InnovizOne. We believe that high-performance, cost-efficient solutions will drive increased market adoption of our products.\n37\nPenetrate lower levels of autonomy (e.g., Level 2+ ADAS) and leverage our software suite to position for seamless upgrade to Level 3 autonomous driving. We believe that\nInnovizTwo provides a compelling solution for Level 2+ systems, from both a cost and performance perspectives. At the same time, our LiDAR solution can be upgraded from\nLevel 2+ to Level 3 through a vehicle software update without changes to the hardware components or the need for new hardware. Therefore, we believe that our solution is uniquely\npositioned to provide Level 3 functionality given the ease with which this upgrade can be affected. Accordingly, we will further refine, develop and integrate our software offering in\norder to better position ourselves for capturing market share in the Level 2+ and Level 3 through Level 5 vehicle markets on the basis of software-based transitions from the Level 2+\nmarket.\nExpand partnerships. We believe that our design win with Volkswagen and other automotive manufacturers were enabled by our unique automotive grade product design. We\nalso believe that the discipline and adherence to industry leading safety and manufacturing standards required of us as a Volkswagen supplier and as a Tier-1 direct supplier, can be\nleveraged to penetrate and partner with other OEM customers. We believe that our existing partnerships with Volkswagen and BMW provide evidence to potential partners and\ncustomers of the maturity, robustness, and automotive grade nature of our products, and we intend to pursue partnerships with additional OEMs in order to grow our customer base.\nContinue to invest in a strong software suite. Our advanced perception software turns our LiDAR products’ raw point cloud data into perception outputs. The outputs can serve\nas a standalone, functionally safe perception software, or can be integrated into the vehicle’s existing perception stack at different levels to support various sensor fusion architectures.\nIn addition, our software leverages the rich data derived from Innoviz LiDARs, coupled with proprietary state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-based algorithms, to provide superior\nscene perception and deliver an automotive-grade ASIL B(D) solution. Our unique perception solution is designed for autonomous driving functionality and therefore is validated in\naccordance with the highest automotive standards, including data collected from staged scenes and open roads in various road and adverse weather conditions. We intend to continue\nto develop and refine our perception software for InnovizOne and InnovizTwo, in order to further complement our hardware offerings with advanced AI and machine learning-based\nclassification, detection and tracking features. In addition, Innoviz will continue to collect data and annotate relevant information for the purposes of improved training and validation\nof our perception suite. Innoviz is also developing an edge-processing electronic control unit (ECU) for the purpose of point cloud processing, primarily for the perception software\napplication.\nDevelop additional products to better address other LiDAR markets. The main drivers for our revenue growth are our automotive applications for LiDARs in passenger cars,\nthe Level 3 and Level 2+ applications, which are expected to show significant growth in the 2024-30 vehicle model years. However, the products developed for the passenger car\nsegment have equal appeal in multi-LiDAR perimeter sensing uses, such as in robotaxis, shuttles, trucks and delivery robot vehicles, therefore, further to our recently announced\noperational realignment, our development efforts are focused on the InnovizTwo and further development of the Innoviz360 was postponed. We believe these applications will show\na significant rise in sensor consumption because they require multiple units to complete the surround sensing requirements of the completely automated driving machine. As Level 4\nplatforms such as robotaxis, shuttles, trucks and delivery robots complete development and move to commercial deployment, we believe our LiDARs are well-positioned to capture\nmarket share from less robust technologies. The size, look, feel and ease of integration of our products, together with automotive grade robustness for environmental performance\nquality, make our products especially appealing to the Level 4 segment.\nProducts\nInnoviz One Innoviz Two\n* Product size may differ according to specifications\nOur products provide a good understanding of the location of the vehicle in a broad range of driving environments and allow for confident detection and planning at varying\nvehicle speeds. Our product portfolio encompasses sensor hardware and perception and decision-making software that improve existing vehicle features and enable new levels of\nvehicle automation for passenger car and commercial applications.\n38\nOur product offerings include:\n• InnovizOne —a solid-state LiDAR sensor specifically designed for automakers and robotaxis, shuttles, trucks and delivery companies requiring an automotive-grade,\nmass-producible solution to achieve autonomy. The automotive-grade sensor is purpose-built to be rugged, affordable, reliable, low-power consuming, lightweight,\nhigh-performing and seamlessly integrable into Level 3 through 5 autonomous vehicles to ensure the safety of passengers and pedestrians alike. InnovizOne was\nclassified as a laser class 1 product under European standard IEC 60825-1 Rev 3 Class 1 on September 24, 2019.\n• InnovizTwo —announced in the fourth quarter of 2020, InnovizTwo is a next generation high-performance automotive-grade LiDAR sensor that is currently in\ndevelopment, and engineering samples have been produced for demonstrations and evaluations. InnovizTwo will offer a fully featured solution for all levels of\nautonomous driving. Featuring a major cost reduction compared to InnovizOne, InnovizTwo also includes improved lasers and detectors that increase range\nperformance at a lower system cost, which is expected to provide a significant performance improvement over InnovizOne. InnovizTwo will also offer the option to\nintegrate the Perception Application (see below) in the LiDAR sensor itself.\n• Perception Application —software application that turns raw point cloud data from Innoviz LiDAR products into perception outputs. The outputs can serve as a\nstandalone, functionally safe perception software, or can be integrated into the vehicle’s existing perception stack at different levels to support various sensor fusion\narchitectures. In addition, our software leverages the rich data derived from our LiDAR products, coupled with proprietary state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-based\nalgorithms, to provide superior scene perception and deliver an automotive-grade ASIL B(D) solution.\nCommercial Traction\nThe early start with BMW’s Level 3 series production program resulted in our team becoming deeply engaged in ISO26262 compliance and functional safety adherence. With\nactive participation, including a resident team, in the BMW program at Unterschleißheim in Germany, our team delivered InnovizOne LiDARs to the integration teams at Magna and\nBMW and learned a lot from the extensive validation testing that is needed in order to conform to applicable standards.\nRecognizing the long path to volume ramp in the automotive industry, with additional complexity due to demanding safety standards for autonomous vehicles, such\nas ISO26262-ASIL-B, we have taken a broad-based approach to potential LiDAR market opportunities. Instead of treating adjacent markets in an opportunistic manner, we have\nplaced considerable focus on discovering applications and cultivating customers and resellers in these markets. Accordingly, we focus our business development activity on both the\nconsumer automotive market and on other markets:\nAutomotive: high focus, with significant management attention, on a number of automotive opportunities, where the LiDAR and perception offering are tailored to the OEMs’\nneeds, with a view to acquiring high volume series production programs, similar to the BMW L3 Program. This approach has our business and R&D teams working together both\ndirectly with OEMs as well as (in some instances) with Tier-1 partners to respond to OEM RFQs with customized offerings. Our collaborative relationships allow us to work with\nthe Tier-1 and OEM engineering and procurement teams with complete transparency, bringing innovation, manufacturing knowhow and value to the program.\nWe are working closely with leading OEMs in Europe, Asia and North America that define Level 2+ and Level 3 programs and consider the adoption of InnovizTwo to such\nprograms, and thereby bring significant additional value to the ADAS+ and autonomous applications.\nOther Segments: leveraging our products to win business in all other segments where volumes are lower at present, but where opportunities of scale are likely in the near term.\nThis approach requires a broad presence in the global marketplace, with our business teams participating in direct and channel relationships with potential customers in all segments.\nWe are in discussions with a number of robotaxi, shuttle, truck and delivery robots customers to incorporate InnovizOne and InnovizTwo into their upcoming builds. The form\nfactor, field-of-view and range of these products is well suited to sensing applications on the perimeter of these Level 4 platforms.\nSales and Marketing\nWe currently market and sell our LiDAR solutions through a direct sales organization as well as through our distribution channels. Our technology and product focus since\ninception has been on the automotive OEM opportunity for high performance LiDAR solutions in the autonomous driving industry. This focus has also informed and guided our sales\nand marketing activities, which led to early contact with OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers, and also led to our sales team acting as a bridge between our research and development team and\nthese partners. Our sales and marketing team continues to focus on expanding our relationships with OEMs and seeks to leverage our existing relationships as well as new\ncommercial agreements, to expand our market to other industries.\n39\nResearch and Development\nWe have invested a significant amount of time and expense into research and development of LiDAR-based technologies. Our research and development team is the largest\ndepartment in the company and, as of December 31, 2023, was comprised of 395 employees. Our ability to maintain a leadership position in the industry depends to a great degree on\nour ongoing research and development activities. Our research and development team includes engineers and researchers with a diverse range of expertise and diverse levels of\nexperience and academic backgrounds, including holders of B.Sc., M.Sc. and PhD degrees from leading academic institutions. Our research and development activities are largely\nconducted at our headquarters in Rosh HaAin, Israel.\nCreating an automotive-grade, eye-safe and cost efficient ~905nm wavelength LiDAR solution and the accompanying perception software required the efforts of a multi-\ndisciplinary team with expertise spanning optics, lasers, mechanical engineering, micro-electronics, chip design, MEMS design, complex IC packaging, algorithms, neural networks,\nsystems engineering and software architecture and engineering.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success and competitive advantage depend in part upon our ability to develop and protect our core technology and intellectual property. We own a portfolio of intellectual\nproperty, including registered patents, registered trademarks, registered designs, confidential technical information, and expertise in the development of LiDAR technology and\nsoftware for, among others, autonomous vehicles.\nWe have filed patent and trademark applications in order to further secure these rights and strengthen our ability to defend against third parties who may infringe on our rights.\nWe also rely on design and manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing and exclusivity opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive\nposition. Additionally, we protect our proprietary rights through agreements with our commercial partners, supply-chain vendors, employees, and consultants, as well as close\nmonitoring of developments and products in our industry.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned 50 allowed and issued patents and had 130 pending patent applications. The portfolio includes U.S. and foreign patent applications filed\nin Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. In addition, our company has registered U.S. and foreign trademarks and designs. Our patents and patent applications cover a broad range of\nsystem level and component level aspects of our key technology including, among other things, LiDAR systems, laser, scanner, receivers, optical devices, and perception technology.\nCompetition\nThe market for competitive automotive sensing solutions that enable autonomous driving is an emerging one with many potential applications in the development stage. As a\nresult, we face competition from a range of companies seeking to have their products incorporated into these developing applications and it may take a period of time for our primary\ncompetitors to emerge.\nOur competitors are also working to advance technology, reliability, and innovation in their development of new and improved solutions. Although we believe that we have\nmarket leading technology, we continue to face competition from existing competitors and new companies emerging in the LiDAR, camera and radar industries. Within the LiDAR\nsegment of the industry, where competition is based significantly on performance and cost and energy efficiency, we face competition from companies utilizing a variety of laser\nwavelengths such as ~905nm and ~1550nm lasers, as well as a variety of steering mechanisms, such as MEMS, mechanical, Optical Phased Array, and non-scanning LiDARs\n(Flash). We believe that it may take new, smaller companies a substantial period of time to gain the recognition and trust of top-tier automotive OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers, as well as\ncustomers and partners in other non-automotive industries.\nMany of our competitors offer more limited solutions for niche applications. Some competitors are currently selling solutions that offer lower levels of performance in ADAS\nand new autonomous driving markets. In the passenger car ADAS market, a number of competitors have already achieved substantial market share using camera and radar-based\nperception sensing solutions.\n40\nWe entered the passenger car market with a higher performance LiDAR product than those used for ADAS today. Our LiDAR product empowers higher performance ADAS at\nprice points that we believe we can displace current solutions. Our early engagement with a premium OEM and with Tier-1 partners also differentiate us from other LiDAR makers.\nWhile LiDAR competitors will continue to emerge and recede, we believe that our high-performance LiDARs, strong intellectual property portfolio, software products, and\ndesign wins with leading OEMs, have established barriers to those who follow. We expect that our technology and continuing innovation, as well as our longstanding cooperation\nwith leading OEMs, will support our position as a leader in advancing LiDAR technology in the market based on several market differentiators.\nManufacturing\nOur proprietary LiDAR architecture focuses on developing a full LiDAR autonomous driving solution that utilizes a ~905nm wavelength laser. In order to break through the\nperformance limitations resulting from optical peak power limitations, we have used a multi-disciplinary approach to design the key system components, such as our unique scanning\nsystems, including the MEMS module, silicon detectors and the signal processing ASIC, in order to improve the optical link budget of the system while acquiring the best possible\ndetection capabilities for a given optical link budget. Designing critical components in-house rather than using off-the-shelf commodity components provides for protectable and\nsustainable technology differentiation from LiDAR competitors or alternative technologies. We believe one of the significant barriers to entry for automotive LiDAR is the processes\nand know-how to manufacture a compact and intricate sensing product in high volumes.\nAt the same time, we have focused on operating in accordance with the rigorous manufacturing standards of the automotive industry from the company’s earliest days.\nTherefore, we have utilized an automotive-level contract manufacturer and vendors to manufacture our products and sub-components from an early stage. Working with such an\nexperienced contract manufacturer and vendors added to our manufacturing knowhow and instilled discipline and quality in our development process.\nWe have begun manufacturing InnovizOne at Magna’s automotive grade facility in Holly, Michigan to meet increasing demand for our LiDAR product. In this context, please\nsee reference herein to the Magna MOU and the Magna Agreement (as defined herein).\nAlthough manufacturing of our products and sub-components is outsourced, our operations and quality assurance teams manage the sourcing of specialized equipment required\nfor assembly, calibration and testing of our LiDAR systems. These teams also manage our quality control and assurance operations and work with our suppliers to monitor quality\nand improve yield.\nWe source our components from a variety of third-party manufacturers throughout Europe. The prices and availability of our components may be impacted by changes in\nsupply and demand, as well as market uncertainty and other factors. Historically, we have been able to source our components at prices satisfactory to our Company; however, we\nmay be unable to do so in the future.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Practices\nWe are a global company that is focused on creating a positive social impact by promoting the future of mobility and increasing road-traffic safety and welfare, all through the\nvalues of excellence, education, creation and innovation. As such, we recognize the importance of creating shared values for our different stakeholders and translating those values\ninto measurable goals in order to guide our long-term success. We also have a responsibility to meet high standards of quality, safety and sustainability as a service provider to the\nautomotive industry.\nTherefore, we are currently in the process of developing an ESG program, with the hope of implementing shared values into our day-to-day business activities as soon as\npossible, while continuing to grow our business, all under the supervision of our dedicated nominating, environmental, social and governance committee of the board of directors, and\nwith the assistance of a reputable independent ESG consulting firm.\nWe completed the development of an ESG strategy which guides our long term ESG-related efforts, taking into consideration the expectations of our shareholders as well as\nour business needs and goals.\nWe are developing a long-term implementation plan for our ESG strategy, including measurable long-term ESG goals, and are establishing internal processes to monitor and\nmeasure the related data. We believe we will be in a position to make significant progress on this implementation plan, including publishing our first ESG report, during 2024.\n41\nRegulation\nAutonomous vehicles are subject to emerging regulatory frameworks in the United States at the federal and state levels. In general, at both the federal and state level, the United\nStates has supported testing and development of autonomous functionality through open information exchange. For example, in January 2021, NHTSA expanded its AV TEST\nInitiative from a pilot to a full program, and through this Initiative a variety of stakeholders provide documentation covering specific topics, such as how automated systems detect\nobjects on the road, how information is displayed to drivers, what cybersecurity measures are in place and the methods used to test the design and validation of autonomous driving\nsystems. NHTSA has been utilizing this information to impose additional regulatory obligations on ADAS and autonomous driving systems, and although we do not anticipate any\nnear-term impediments to our technology and products, the situation is an evolving one with some uncertainties and elements beyond our control. Many states in the U.S. have long\nimposed various requirements on autonomous vehicle development and testing, including operational, registration and financial assurance requirements for certain autonomous\nvehicle functions and activities. For example, California has been regulating autonomous vehicles in some fashion since 2012 through various restrictions and appears poised to\ncontinue to do so, as in December 2022, California introduced new legislation that would prohibit full self-driving marketing claims. It is possible that restrictions at the state level in\nthe U.S. will ease or be removed as the data and experience supporting the safety of autonomous functionality continues to grow, but we cannot predict when or whether that might\nhappen.\nForeign markets such as the China and the EU also continue to develop their respective standards to define deployment requirements for higher levels of autonomy. In China,\nfor example, the government has undertaken numerous efforts to promote AV development, including its February 2020 release of the Strategies for Innovation and Development of\nAutonomous Vehicles by China’s National Development and Reform Commission and ten other agencies. This initiative sets forth an ambitious plan to create a systematic framework\nfor technical innovation, industrial ecology, infrastructure, regulations and standards, product regulation and network security in the AV market by 2025, and from 2035 to 2050, to\nfully establish an ecosystem for autonomous vehicles. Much of the emerging regulatory and legislative activity around autonomous vehicles in the EU has been focused on data\nprivacy and security, given the volume and types of data collected, stored and transmitted by autonomous vehicles. A key part of Europe’s emerging AV strategy is the creation of a\ncommon European mobility data space, to be further developed in the EU’s “Smart and Sustainable Transport Strategy”. Given the intense work in these areas, we expect a workable\npath forward in the near-term in these markets.\nAs vehicles equipped with our sensors are deployed on public roads in the United States, we will increasingly be subject to the legal and regulatory authority of various federal\nagencies, including NHTSA, which is part of USDOT. Currently, NHTSA’s TREAD reporting process, as well as its strict recall and reporting requirements for any defects related to\nvehicle safety or any FMVSS non-compliance provide the principal legal framework for identifying and addressing safety issues. Similar reporting and recall requirements may apply\nin other markets outside of the U.S.\nHowever, the regulatory landscape in the U.S. and elsewhere is an evolving one. To date, NHTSA’s guidance to industry generally has been supportive of AV technology\ndevelopment, testing and implementation. More generally, NHTSA has established six automation principles that will be applied to its oversight of AV development: (1) prioritizing\nsafety; (2) remaining technology neutral; (3) modernizing regulations; (4) encouraging consistent federal and state regulatory environments; (5) providing guidance, research and best\npractices to government and industry partners; and (6) protecting consumers’ ability to choose conventional and autonomous vehicles. More specifically, NHTSA has been granting\nexemptions from FMVSS compliance for ADAS-equipped and AVs where it is satisfied that the non-compliance will not impose public safety issues and as a tool for encouraging\ntechnology development, testing and innovation. At the same time, NHTSA is actively reviewing other potential regulatory barriers to AV development as it proceeds to promulgate\nnew regulations and to update certain FMVSS to address ambiguities and other issues created by the application of FMVSS to innovative, non-conventional vehicle designs utilized,\nor anticipated to be utilized, in certain ADAS and autonomous driving vehicles. In 2023, NHTSA promulgated the “Occupant Protection for Vehicles with Automated Driving\nSystems” final rule to update several FMVSS to account for vehicles that are equipped with ADAS and do not have traditional manual controls associated with human drivers.\nNHTSA also proposed rules to update FMVSS for crash avoidance, safety messaging and passengerless vehicles as well as jointly proposed a rule with FMCSA regarding AEB test\ndevices for heavy vehicles. NHTSA also announced plans to launch the AV STEP that would remove the 2,500 cap on driverless vehicles allowed on the roadways and expand the\nprogram for exemption from FVMSS for ADS-equipped vehicles, but would impose additional data reporting requirements on all vehicles participating in AV STEP.\nAs noted above, many states have instituted restrictions and requirements for autonomous vehicle technologies. At least 29 states and the District of Columbia have enacted\nsome type of autonomous vehicle regulations, and a number of state governors have also issued executive orders. These efforts largely focus on safety and regulate commercial\nactivity through permitting and reporting regimes.\n42\nOverall, the regulatory landscape is still evolving rapidly. As legal frameworks around autonomous vehicles continue to develop and change in the U.S. and elsewhere, we may\nbecome subject to additional regulatory schemes and requirements.\nAs a LiDAR technology company, we also are subject to the laws and regulations beyond those specific to vehicle safety standards and highway safety. For example, our\nproducts are governed by the Electronic Product Radiation Control Program administered by the FDA. This Program establishes performance standards and imposes requirements for\nregistration, labelling, testing and reporting. Failure to comply with the Program may result a variety of consequences, including product recalls or replacements, warning letters,\nuntitled letters, safety alerts, injunctions, import alerts, administrative product detentions or seizures, or civil penalties. LiDAR technologies also may need to comply with certain\nstate radiation control licensing and other requirements.\nSimilarly, as a global company deploying cutting-edge technology, we are also subject to trade, export controls, customs product classification, hazard labelling and warning,\nand other sourcing and product regulations. Our operations also are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to our employees, such as wage and\nhour, worker’s compensation and occupational health and safety regulations.\nLike all companies operating in similar industries, we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulation at the federal and state level pertaining to matters such\nas emissions to air and water, manufacture, processing, use, storage and distribution of chemical substances, hazardous waste generation and disposal, and remediation of\nenvironmental contamination. Compliance with these rules may include the need to obtain permits and licenses and to allow inspections of our facilities and products.\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in actions, claims, suits, and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including assertions by third\nparties relating to intellectual property infringement, breaches of contract or warranties or employment-related matters. We are not currently a party to any material actions, claims,\nsuits or other legal proceedings the outcome of which, if determined adversely to it, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nC. Organizational Structure\nThe legal name of our company is Innoviz Technologies Ltd. and we are organized under the laws of the State of Israel. We have five wholly-owned subsidiaries: Innoviz\nTechnologies Inc., which is incorporated in the United States; Innoviz Technologies GmbH, which is incorporated under the laws of Germany; Innoviz Technologies BY LLC, which\nis incorporated under the laws of Belarus (“Innoviz Belarus”); Innoviz Software Centre Bucharest S.R.L, which is incorporated under the laws of Romania; and Innoviz Technologies\nTrading Shanghai Co., Ltd., which is incorporated under the laws of the People’s Republic of China.\nDuring 2022, we shut down our activities in Belarus. We have not had any employees in Belarus since December 31, 2022 and we are in the process of liquidating Innoviz\nBelarus, which we hope to complete as soon as reasonably possible.\nD. Property, Plant and Equipment\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Rosh HaAin, Israel, where we currently lease an office with approximately 16,350 square meters pursuant to a lease agreement dated\nNovember 1, 2021 (the “Lease Agreement”) (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 4.14 to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 filed\nwith the SEC on March 30, 2022). This facility contains engineering, research and development, testing, product, sales and administrative functions. The initial term under the Lease\nAgreement is for 67 months and expires on January 31, 2028. We have an option under the Lease Agreement to renew the lease for additional 60 months, which will be exercised\nautomatically unless we inform the lessor in advance. We also lease a small office space in Santa Clara, California, pursuant to a lease agreement that is in effect until July 31, 2024,\nand a small office in Munich, Germany, pursuant to a lease agreement that is in effect until November 15, 2027.\nUnless otherwise stated, all our facilities are utilized. We believe that our offices and facilities (as currently conducted and in accordance with future plans) are adequate for our\ncurrent needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available when needed.\n43\nItem Unresolved Staff Comments\n4A.\nNone.\nItem 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the “Selected Financial Data” and the historical\naudited annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or\nset forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements\nthat involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the section entitled Item 3.D. “Key Information—Risk Factors” of this Annual\nReport, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a leading Tier-1 direct supplier of high-performance, automotive grade LiDAR sensors and perception software that feature technological breakthroughs across core\ncomponents and bring enhanced vision and superior performance to enable safe autonomous driving at a mass scale. We believe that we provide a complete and comprehensive\nsolution for OEMs and Tier-1 partners that are developing and marketing autonomous driving vehicles to the passenger car and other relevant markets, such as robotaxis, shuttles,\ndelivery vehicles and trucks.\nWe were founded in 2016 by veterans of Unit 81, the elite technology unit of Israel’s Intelligence Corps, one of the most prestigious multidisciplinary technological units in the\nIDF. From our founding, our culture drew from Unit 81’s core values of solving sophisticated technological problems through creativity and agile thinking. We have relied on these\nvalues to address the needs of autonomous vehicles in a manner that strikes the desired balance between performance and cost. We created a new type of LiDAR sensor from the\nchip-level up, including a suite of powerful and sophisticated software applications for high-performance computer vision to allow superior perception. Our multidisciplinary team\ndeveloped an operational MEMS-based (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) LiDAR prototype, which attracted the attention of leading Tier-1 companies such as Magna and Aptiv\nPLC as early as 2017. This was followed by a further intensive development and qualification stage, which culminated with our company achieving a design win with BMW in 2018\nto power BMW’s Level 3 autonomous platform.\nDuring 2022, we made the major strategic decision to become a Tier-1 direct supplier of LiDAR to the automotive industry. This decision allows us to have direct technical\ndiscussions with customers and to improve pricing to automotive OEMs with the goal of continuing to strengthen our position in the automotive market. This strategic decision has\nalready played a significant role in our major OEM program wins since, as discussed below.\nIn 2022, following more than two years of extensive diligence and qualification, we were selected by Volkswagen as its direct LiDAR supplier for automated vehicles within the\nVolkswagen brands with our InnovizTwo next generation high-performance automotive-grade LiDAR sensor. Later in 2022, an Asia-based automotive OEM selected us to serve as\nits direct LiDAR supplier for series production passenger vehicles. BMW and Volkswagen are leaders in deploying new technologies into the automotive industry. We believe that\nour close cooperation with these OEMs uniquely positions us to make Level 3 autonomous driving a commercial reality.\nIn 2023, we announced that Volkswagen aims to expand its use of our InnovizTwo LiDAR to its existing light commercial vehicle program. In addition, we announced that\nwe were beginning a B-sample development phase on a new generation of LiDAR for BMW Group. Under the development agreement, we developed B-samples based on our\nsecond generation InnovizTwo LiDAR sensor.\nThe sustained cooperation with our customers provides our engineers and other research and development personnel with a valuable competitive edge. These engineers and\nother research and development personnel have been meticulously trained to design, operate and verify our many ground-breaking innovations in accordance and in compliance with\nthe rigorous ISO26262 standard for Functional Safety in the automotive industry. Compliance with this and other standards have been enforced by regular ongoing audits of Innoviz\nand rigorous testing by our key suppliers, existing customers and prospective customers that thoroughly review the performance of various elements of our operations. As a result,\nour products have been constructed from the bottom up with hardware and software technology that meets the most stringent automotive safety, quality, environmental,\nmanufacturing, and other standards.\nOur innovation has produced LiDAR solutions that deliver market leading performance and that meet the current demanding safety requirements for Level 2+ through Level 5\nautonomous vehicles at price points suitable for mass produced passenger vehicles. Our integrated custom design of advanced hardware and software components, which leverages\nthe multidisciplinary expertise and experience of our team, enables us to provide turn-key autonomous solutions that are likely to accelerate widespread adoption across automakers\nat serial production scale.\n44\nOur robust software suite enables our ~905nm wavelength laser-based LiDAR architecture to be easily leveraged to provide compelling solutions for Level 2+ through Level 4\n(and Level 5 when applicable). This means that we are positioned to penetrate the current market, which is focused primarily on Level 2+ (with some Level 3 production), and to\ncontinue to capture and extend our market share to Levels 3 through 5 as the market continues to mature.\nWe are currently expanding our third-party manufacturing capacity through contract manufacturers to meet an anticipated increase in customer demand for our products, while\nalso further developing a next generation high-performance automotive-grade LiDAR sensor, the InnovizTwo, that is expected to provide further cost efficiencies, while enabling\neven higher performance solutions for vehicles offering driving automations levels of Level 2+ and above.\nGeographically, the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from customers in Europe and North America. As we continue to grow, we expect to generate additional\nrevenue from existing and other geographic areas and the geographic mix of our revenue could therefore change over time.\nBusiness Combination\nOn December 10, 2020, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with Collective Growth, Perception, Antara Capital and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Business\nCombination Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Collective Growth, with Collective Growth surviving the merger. Upon consummation of the Business Combination and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement on April 5, 2021, Collective Growth became a wholly owned subsidiary of Innoviz.\nKey Factors Affecting Innoviz’s Operating Results\nWe believe that our future performance and success depends to a substantial extent on the following factors, each of which is in turn subject to significant risks and challenges,\nincluding those discussed below and in the section of this Annual Report entitled Item 3.D. “Key Information—Risk Factors.”\nMarket Adoption\nWe believe that widespread adoption of LiDAR across applications for autonomy is approaching and that we are well-positioned in both automotive and nonautomotive\nmarkets to take advantage of this opportunity. Nevertheless, automotive OEMs and their suppliers are just beginning to commercialize autonomous systems that rely on LiDAR\ntechnology. Accordingly, we expect the rate of actual adoption and commercialization of LiDAR-based solutions by automotive OEMs and their suppliers to impact our results of\noperations, including revenue and gross margins, for the foreseeable future. Given the focus of the consumer automotive market on Level 3 and Level 2+ segments, we expect these\nverticals to grow significantly over the short to medium term, we are aligning our focus and efforts on these segments, specifically via our InnovizTwo product.\nWe believe that InnovizTwo will drive significant revenue growth in the near to medium term. We also believe that market penetration of InnovizTwo will drive revenues in the\nLevel 3 segment of the market. This is because the architecture of our products, which feature agile configuration of multiple components, allow us to offer different product\nconfigurations based on the same hardware with only software modification. Accordingly, we can address multiple market needs and niches without the need to develop several\nhardware configurations. Therefore, our LiDAR solution enables upgrade from Level 2+ to Level 3 through a vehicle software update without changes to the hardware components or\nthe need of new hardware.\nWe also target markets such as robotaxis, shuttles, delivery vehicles and trucks. We believe that LiDAR-based solutions in these emerging markets are still in the pre-\ncommercial development stage and, as a result, our future success also depends on customers in these industries adopting and bringing these solutions to commercial scale.\nDesign Wins\nOur solutions are designed to be a key enabling technology for OEMs in automotive and other applications. Because our solutions must be integrated into a broader platform by\nthe OEM, it is critical that we achieve design wins with these customers. The time necessary to achieve design wins varies based on the market and application. The design cycle in\nthe automotive market tends to be substantially longer and more onerous than in other markets. Even within the automotive market, achieving a design win with an automotive OEM\ntakes considerably longer than a design cycle for an aftermarket application. We consider design wins to be critical to our future success, although the revenue generated by each\ndesign win and the time necessary to achieve such a win can vary significantly making it difficult to predict our financial performance.\n45\nProduct Cost and Margins\nOur results of operations will depend on our ability to leverage the fixed costs involved in production of our current products and our ability to improve gross margins on the\nbasis of volume and manufacturing efficiencies.\nInnovizTwo is based on an improved design, which allows: (i) lower bill of materials, and (ii) more efficient manufacturing process, which together may allow for a significant\ncost reduction and improved gross margins.\nContinued Investment and Innovation\nOur unique LiDAR and perception solutions that feature technological breakthroughs across core components and allow us to act as a leading supplier in a competitive market.\nWe believe that our financial performance is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain this position. This in turn will depend on our future research and development\ninvestments and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced research and development personnel. These are necessary to both continue the work required on our\ncurrent products and future products to full commercialization, and also to identify and respond to rapidly evolving customer requirements, develop and introduce innovative new\nproducts and enhance and service existing products. Failure to do this could adversely affect our market position and our revenue, and our research and development investments may\nnot be recovered.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nOur revenues derive primarily from sales of LiDAR sensors, critical components and NRE to customers.\nRevenue from LiDAR sensors and critical components is recognized at a point in time when the control of the goods is transferred to the customer, generally upon delivery.\nNRE to certain customers may require substantive customer acceptance due to performance acceptance criteria that is considered more than a formality. For these services,\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time upon customer acceptance. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized revenue related to NRE in the amount of\n$15.2 million and $0, respectively.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues include the manufacturing cost of LiDAR sensors, which primarily consists of components costs, sub-assembly costs and personnel-related costs, and amounts\npaid to third-party contract manufacturers and vendors. Cost of revenues also includes depreciation, costs of providing NRE, an allocated portion of overhead, warranty costs, excess\nand obsolete inventory and shipping costs. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods to the extent revenue increases, however we expect our\nproducts’ unit cost to decrease as sales increase thereby leveraging economies of scale achievable due to our business model and higher production efficiencies.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development (“R&D”) efforts are focused on enhancing and developing cost efficient LiDAR solution and the accompanying perception software.\nR&D expenses include:\n• personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in research and engineering functions;\n• expenses related to materials, software licenses, depreciation, supplies and third-party services;\n• prototype expenses; and\n• an allocated portion of facility and IT costs.\nWe expense R&D costs as incurred until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products is generally shortly before the products are released\nto production. We expect that our R&D expenses will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future as we invest in R&D activities to enhance our product portfolio.\n46\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses include:\n• personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in sales and marketing;\n• sales and marketing activities, including the cost of sales commissions, marketing programs, trade shows, consulting services, promotional materials and demonstration\nequipment, among other costs; and\n• an allocated portion of facility and IT costs.\nWe expect our sales and marketing expenses to remain relatively flat as we focus our marketing activities in the automotive market.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include:\n• personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in corporate, executive, finance and other administrative\nfunctions;\n• general and administration activities, including expenses relating to outside professional services, including legal, investors relations and audit and accounting services;\nand\n• the relevant portion of expenses for facilities, depreciation and IT costs that was not allocated to other operating expenses.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the near term; however, we expect such increases to occur at a slower pace than in the\nprevious year.\nFinancial Income, Net\nFinancial income, net consists primarily of interest on cash and cash equivalents deposited in our bank account, exchange rate differences arising from our ILS denominated\nlease liabilities under ASC 842, marketable securities remeasurement and private placement warrants remeasurement. The deposits will vary based on cash and cash equivalents, and\nwith market rates. Our marketable securities have an average credit rating of “A” and a maturity of up to three years. We do not intend to invest more than 5% of our investment\nportfolio in a single security at time of purchase.

Gross margin increased to approximately (56)% for the year ended December 31, 2023, from approximately (145)% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to sales of NRE during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nYear ended December 31, Change Change\n2023 2022 $ %\n(In thousands) (In thousands) (In thousands)\nResearch and development $ 92,676 $ 95,107 $ (2,431) (3)%\nSales and marketing 8,777 10,300 (1,523) (15)%\nGeneral and administrative 19,535 19,178 357 2%\nTotal operating expenses $ 120,988 $ 124,585 $ (3,597) (3)%\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased by approximately $2.4 million, or 3%, to approximately $92.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from approximately\n$95.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in payroll of $5.0 million (primarily due to allocation of direct costs related to sales of NRE), facilities cost of $1.5 million\nand depreciation and amortization of $0.4 million. The decrease in research and development expenses was partly offset by increases in third-party software and consulting services\nof $2.6 million and stock-based compensation of $1.7 million.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by approximately $1.5 million, or 15%, to approximately $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from approximately $10.3\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of $0.9 million in stock-based compensation and $0.5 million in marketing expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.3 million, or 2%, to approximately $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from approximately\n$19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe increase was primarily attributable to increases in payroll of $0.7 million and stock-based compensation of $0.7 million. The increase was partly offset by decreases in\ninsurance of $0.8 million and depreciation and amortization of $0.3 million.\n49\nFinancial Income, net\nYear ended December 31 Change Change\n2023 2022 $ %\n(In thousands) (In thousands) (In thousands)\nFinancial income, net $ 9,790 $ 6,802 $ 2,988 44%\nFinancial income, net was approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to financial income, net of approximately $6.8 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022.\nThe increase was primarily related to bank deposit interest income of $3.7 million and to a gain of $2.0 million related to marketable securities. These increases were partially\noffset by exchange rate differences of $2.4 million arising from our ILS denominated lease liabilities under ASC 842 (the ILS was devaluated compared to USD during the year\nended December 31, 2023) as well as to warrants liability revaluation of $0.4 million.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency exchange fluctuations, changes in interest rates and inflation. We regularly assess currency, interest rate and\ninflation risks to minimize any adverse effects on our business as a result of those factors.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur financial results are reported in USD, and changes in the exchange rate between USD and local currencies in the countries in which we operate (primarily ILS) may affect\nthe results of our operations. In the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 98% of our revenues were denominated in USD. The USD cost of our operations in countries other\nthan the United States may be negatively influenced by devaluation of the USD against other currencies.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the value of the USD appreciated against the value of the ILS by approximately 3.1%. Our most significant foreign currency\nexposures are related to our operations in Israel. We hedge our anticipated exposure by exchanging USD into ILS in amounts sufficient to fund up to three months of operations and\nmonitoring foreign currency exchange rates over time.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and meet our liquidity requirements. We invest in bank deposits and marketable securities,\nprimarily in USD.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, which is affected by changes in the general level of the Bank of Israel interest rates\nand United States Federal Reserve interest rates. Due to the short-term nature and the low-risk profile of our interest-bearing accounts, an immediate 10% change in interest rates\nwould not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and restricted bank deposits or on our financial position or results of\noperations.\nOur investments in marketable securities are primarily in securities with an average credit rating of “A” and a maturity of up to three years. We do not intend to invest more than\n5% of our investment portfolio in a single security at time of purchase.\nOther Market Risks\nWe do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nB. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nPrior to 2021, we funded our operations primarily from private placements of our convertible preferred shares in an aggregate amount of approximately $260 million. During\n2021 and 2022, we funded our operations primarily from the proceeds of the Business Combination of approximately $370 million.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering in which we issued and sold an aggregate of 26,352,878 ordinary shares for proceeds of\napproximately $61.4 million, net of the underwriting discount and before deducting offering expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $150.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, short term deposits, short term restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash\nequivalents and marketable securities are invested in accordance with our investment policy.\n50\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands) (In thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (93,053) $ (93,411)\nNet cash provided by investing activities 1,064 125,354\nNet cash provided by financing activities 61,856 609\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 515 (1,139)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (29,618) $ 31,413\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, operating activities used approximately $93.1 million. The primary factors affecting operating cash flows during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 were the net loss of approximately $123.5 million, impacted by non-cash charges of approximately $30.4 million consisting of stock-based compensation of\napproximately $22.3 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $9.2 million, remeasurement of private warrants of approximately $(0.5) million and an increase in\nworking capital of approximately $(0.6) million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, operating activities used approximately $93.4 million. The primary factors affecting operating cash flows during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 were the net loss of approximately $126.9 million, impacted by non-cash charges of approximately $33.5 million consisting of stock-based compensation of\napproximately $19.4 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $7.5 million and remeasurement of private warrants of approximately $(0.9) million and a decrease in\nworking capital of approximately $7.5 million.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by investing activities was approximately $1.1 million, which primarily resulted from withdrawal of bank deposits of\napproximately $141.5 million, proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of approximately $83.5 million, partially offset by investment in bank deposits of\napproximately $165.6 million, investment in marketable securities of approximately $51.7 million and purchases of property, plant, and equipment of approximately $6.6 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by investing activities was approximately $125.4 million, which primarily resulted from the withdrawal of bank\ndeposits of approximately $230.0 million, partially offset by investments in bank deposits of approximately $79.5 million, purchases of property, plant, and equipment of\napproximately $22.6 million and an increase in restricted deposits of approximately $2.6 million.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was approximately $61.9 million resulting from $61.4 million in net proceeds from underwritten\npublic offering and $0.5 million from the exercise of employee stock options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by financing activities was approximately $0.6 million resulting from the exercise of employee stock options.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect to continue to invest substantially in our main activities in particular, as we continue research and development activities, commercialization expenses related to\nproduct sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. As we achieve further commercial success, we may need to obtain additional funding to support our continuing operations.\nIn addition, our financial stability is reviewed by existing and potential customers from time to time and we believe that a stronger cash position provides us additional time to\nexecute our growth strategy and is perceived positively by such customers and may also provide us with higher grading in such customers’ diligence processes. If we are unable to\nraise capital when and if needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some of our research and development programs or future commercialization\nefforts.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents, short term restricted cash, short term bank deposits and marketable securities of approximately $150.2 million. We\nexpect those funds to be sufficient to continue to execute our business plan for at least the next 12 months.\n51\nWe also expect our losses to be similar in future periods as we:\n• expand production capabilities to produce our LiDAR solutions, and accordingly incur costs associated with outsourcing the production of our LiDAR solutions;\n• expand our design, development, installation and servicing capabilities;\n• continue to invest in research and development;\n• increase our test and validation activities as part of our Tier 1 responsibilities;\n• produce an inventory of our LiDAR solutions; and\n• continue to invest in sales and marketing activities and develop our distribution infrastructure.\nBecause we will incur costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive incremental revenues with respect thereto, losses in future periods will be significant. In addition,\nwe may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in revenues, which would further increase our losses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur remaining performance obligations are comprised of application engineering services not yet satisfied. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction\nprice allocated to remaining performance obligations was $1.2 million, which we expect to recognize as revenue in future years.\nOther than as set forth above, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities.\nC. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc.\nResearch and Development\nWe have invested a significant amount of time and expense into research and development of LiDAR-based technologies. Our research and development team is the largest\ndepartment in the company and, as of December 31, 2023, was comprised of 395 employees. Our ability to maintain a leadership position in the industry depends to a great degree on\nour ongoing research and development activities. Our research and development team includes engineers and researchers with a diverse range of expertise and diverse levels of\nexperience and academic backgrounds, including holders of B.Sc., M.Sc. and PhD degrees from leading academic institutions. Our research and development activities are largely\nconducted at our headquarters in Rosh HaAin, Israel.\nCreating an automotive-grade, eye-safe and cost efficient ~905nm wavelength LiDAR solution and the accompanying perception software required the efforts of a multi-\ndisciplinary team with expertise spanning optics, lasers, mechanical engineering, micro-electronics, chip design, MEMS design, complex IC packaging, algorithms, neural networks,\nsystems engineering and software architecture and engineering.\n52\nIntellectual Property\nOur success and competitive advantage depend in part upon our ability to develop and protect our core technology and intellectual property. We own a portfolio of intellectual\nproperty, including registered patents, registered trademarks, registered designs, confidential technical information, and expertise in the development of LiDAR technology and\nsoftware for, among others, autonomous vehicles.\nWe have filed patent and trademark applications in order to further secure these rights and strengthen our ability to defend against third parties who may infringe on our rights.\nWe also rely on design and manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing and exclusivity opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive\nposition. Additionally, we protect our proprietary rights through agreements with our commercial partners, supply-chain vendors, employees, and consultants, as well as close\nmonitoring of developments and products in our industry.\nD. Trend Information\nSupply Chain\nThe supply chain for certain of our components is currently experiencing significant strain due to, among other factors, higher-than-expected demand, capacity constraints,\nconsolidation of suppliers within the industry, and overburdened shippers. As a result, there has been a decrease in availability, an increase in price and an increase in lead times for\ncertain of our product components.\nWe currently have sufficient component inventory in order to meet the demands of our customers in the near-term. In addition, we are in the process of procuring additional\ncomponent stock to keep in inventory on a go-forward basis to minimize the effect of supply chain strain on our business in the future.\nE. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and\nexpenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for\nchanges in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and\non various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ\nmaterially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we\nbelieve the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates. Please see Note 2 to\nour consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe follow the provisions of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), which applies to all contracts with customers. Under ASC 606, revenue is\nrecognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those\nproducts and services.\nWhen we enter into a contract, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within the contract and determine\nthose that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct.\nWe evaluate each performance obligation to determine if it is satisfied at a point in time or over time.\n53\nInventory Reserves\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost of inventories is determined as follows:\n• Raw materials and work in process - based on weighted average cost.\n• Finished goods – mainly based on weighted average standard cost method.\nWe charge cost of revenue for write-downs of inventories which are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand based on a consideration of marketability and product life cycle\nstage, product development plans, component cost trends, demand forecasts, historical revenue, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.\nLosses expected to arise from firm non-cancelable commitments for future purchases of inventory are charged to cost of revenues unless the losses are recoverable through firm\nsales contracts or other means.\nUseful Lives of Property, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are determined when those\nassets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. When useful life is reassessed for an asset, the remaining carrying amount of the\nasset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated over the revised estimated useful life.\nItem 6.

Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers\nThe table below reflects the Company’s compensation costs related to the employment of our five most highly compensated office holders (as defined in Israel’s Companies\nLaw) with respect to the year ended December 31, 2023. We refer to the five individuals for whom disclosure is provided herein as our “Covered Executives.” For purposes of the\ntable below, “compensation” includes amounts accrued or paid in connection with salary, bonuses, equity-based compensation, retirement or termination payments, benefits and\nperquisites (such as car and phone), social benefits and any undertaking to provide such compensation. All amounts reported in the table are in terms of cost to the Company (in\nUSD), as recognized in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, including compensation paid to such Covered Executives following the end of the year in\nrespect of services provided during the year. Each of the Covered Executives was covered by our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy in accordance with applicable law\nand our Articles.\nSalary and Equity-Based\nName and Principal Position(1) benefits(2) Bonus Compensation(3) Total\nOmer Keilaf (Chief Executive Officer) $ $432,704 $ 0 $ $2,962,154 $ $3,394,858\nOren Buskila (former Chief Research & Development Officer) $ $350,376 $ 0 $ $1,759,057 $ $2,109,432\nUdy Gal-On (Chief Operating Officer) $ $249,684 $ 0 $ $371,526 $ $621,209\nEldar Cegla (Chief Financial Officer) $ $295,554 $ 0 $ $272,703 $ $568,256\nAvishay Moscovici (Chief Research & Development Officer) $ $231,021 $ 0 $ $213,436 $ $444,457\n(1) All Covered Executives were employed on a full time (100%) basis during 2023.

For a discussion on the assumptions used in reaching this valuation,\nsee Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nDirectors\nUnder the Companies Law, the compensation of a public company’s directors requires the approval of its compensation committee, the subsequent approval of its board of\ndirectors and, unless exempted under regulations promulgated under the Companies Law, the approval of its shareholders at a general meeting. If the compensation of a public\ncompany’s directors is inconsistent with its stated compensation policy, then those provisions that must be included in the compensation policy according to the Companies Law must\nhave been considered by the compensation committee and board of directors, and the shareholder approval will require a special majority under which:\n• at least a majority of the shares held by all shareholders who are not controlling shareholders and do not have a personal interest in such matter, present and voting at\nsuch meeting, are voted in favor of the compensation package, excluding abstentions; or\n• the total number of shares of non-controlling shareholders and shareholders who do not have a personal interest in such matter voting against the compensation package\ndoes not exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights in the company.\nExecutive Officers other than the Chief Executive Officer\nThe Companies Law requires the approval of the compensation of a public company’s executive officers (other than the chief executive officer) in the following order: (i) the\ncompensation committee, (ii) the company’s board of directors, and (iii) if such compensation arrangement is inconsistent with the company’s stated compensation policy, the\ncompany’s shareholders (by a special majority vote as discussed above with respect to the approval of director compensation). However, if the shareholders of the company do not\napprove a compensation arrangement with an executive officer that is inconsistent with the company’s stated compensation policy, the compensation committee and board of\ndirectors may override the shareholders’ decision if each of the compensation committee and the board of directors provide detailed reasons for their decision.\n57\nChief Executive Officer\nUnder the Companies Law, the compensation of a public company’s chief executive officer is required to be approved by: (i) the company’s compensation committee; (ii) the\ncompany’s board of directors, and (iii) the company’s shareholders (by a special majority vote as discussed above with respect to the approval of director compensation). However, if\nthe shareholders of the company do not approve the compensation arrangement with the chief executive officer, the compensation committee and board of directors may override the\nshareholders’ decision if each of the compensation committee and the board of directors provide detailed reasons for their decision. The approval of each of the compensation\ncommittee and the board of directors should be in accordance with the company’s stated compensation policy; however, in special circumstances, they may approve compensation\nterms of a chief executive officer that are inconsistent with such policy provided that they have considered those provisions that must be included in the compensation policy\naccording to the Companies Law and that shareholder approval was obtained (by a special majority vote as discussed above with respect to the approval of director compensation). In\naddition, the compensation committee may waive the shareholder approval requirement with regard to the approval of the engagement terms of a candidate for the chief executive\nofficer position if they determine that the compensation arrangement is consistent with the company’s stated compensation policy, that the chief executive officer did not have a prior\nbusiness relationship with the company or a controlling shareholder of the company and that subjecting the approval of the engagement to a shareholder vote would impede the\ncompany’s ability to engage the chief executive officer candidate.\nAggregate Compensation of Office Holders\nThe aggregate compensation, including stock-based compensation, paid by our company to its executive officers and directors as a group for the year ended December 31, 2023\nwas approximately $8.3 million (including one executive officer who left the Company during 2023). This amount includes approximately $0.3 million paid for pension, severance,\nretirement or similar benefits or expenses, but does not include business travel, relocation, professional and business association dues and expenses reimbursed to office holders, and\nother benefit costs commonly reimbursed or paid by companies in Israel.\nAs of December 31, 2023, options to purchase 4,181,613 of our ordinary shares granted to our executive officers and directors as a group were outstanding under our equity\nincentive plans at a weighted average exercise price of $9.84 per ordinary share.\nIn addition, 1,849,036 RSUs granted to our executive officers and directors, were outstanding under our equity incentive plans as of December 31, 2023.\nWe pay to each of our non-employee directors an annual cash retainer as follows: chairperson of the board of directors: $77,500; chairperson of the audit committee,\ncompensation committee and nominating, environmental, social and governance committee: $50,000, $45,000 and $42,500, respectively; members of the audit committee,\ncompensation committee and nominating, environmental, social and governance committee: $42,500, $40,000 and $38,750, respectively; and each other non-employee director:\n$35,000. Such compensation will not be cumulative and the non-employee directors will receive the highest level of compensation to which they are entitled. Additionally, we grant\nthe chairperson of the board of directors an annual grant in a value of up to $300,000, and each of our non-employee directors annual grants in a value of up to $100,000 each. We\nalso reimburse them for expenses arising from their board membership.\nShare Option Plans\n2016 Share Incentive Plan\nOur 2016 Share Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”) was adopted by our board of directors on May 23, 2016. The Plan provides for the grant of options to employees, directors,\noffice holders, service providers and consultants of our company and its subsidiaries.\nWe no longer grant any awards under the 2016 Plan as it was superseded by our 2021 Share Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”), although outstanding options previously granted\nunder the 2016 Plan remain governed by the 2016 Plan. As of December 31, 2023, a total of 5,611,673 options to purchase ordinary shares were outstanding under the 2016 Plan,\nwith a weighted average exercise price of $0.83 per ordinary share. Our board of directors, or a duly authorized committee of our board of directors, administers the 2016 Plan.\n58\n2021 Share Incentive Plan\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we adopted a new share incentive plan, the 2021 Plan, under which we may grant equity-based incentive awards to\nattract, motivate and retain the talent for which we compete. Following the consummation of the Business Combination, we ceased to grant any awards under the 2016 Plan, though\npreviously granted options under the 2016 Plan remain outstanding and governed by the 2016 Plan. As of December 31, 2023, options to purchase 7,717,763 of our ordinary shares\nand 11,699,888 RSUs were outstanding under the 2021 Plan.\nThe maximum number of our ordinary shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan is equal to the sum of (i) 19,510,820 shares (together with any shares subject to awards\nunder the 2016 Plan that expire or become un-exercisable without having been exercised), and (ii) an annual increase on the first day of each year beginning in 2022 and ending in\nand including 2031, equal to the lesser of (A) 5% of the outstanding shares on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar year and (B) such amount as determined by our\nboard of directors if so determined prior to January 1 of a calendar year; provided, however, that no more than 14,000,000 shares in total may be issued upon the exercise of incentive\nstock options under the 2021 Plan. If permitted by us, ordinary shares tendered to pay the exercise price or withholding tax obligations with respect to an award granted under the\n2021 Plan or the 2016 Plan may again be available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. Our board of directors may also reduce the number of ordinary shares reserved and available for\nissuance under the 2021 Plan in its discretion. On January 1, 2024, the number of ordinary shares reserved for the 2021 Plan increased by 8,021,536. The total number of ordinary\nshares reserved and available for future equity grants under the 2021 Plan, as of February 15, 2024 was 8,334,514.\nOur board of directors, or a duly authorized committee of our board of directors, administers the 2021 Plan. Under the 2021 Plan, the administrator has the authority, subject to\napplicable law, to interpret the terms of the 2021 Plan and any award agreements or awards granted thereunder, designate recipients of awards, determine and amend the terms of\nawards, including the exercise price of an option award, the fair market value of an ordinary share, the time and vesting schedule applicable to an award or the method of payment for\nan award, accelerate or amend the vesting schedule applicable to an award, prescribe the forms of agreement for use under the 2021 Plan and take all other actions and make all other\ndeterminations necessary for the administration of the 2021 Plan.\nThe administrator also has the authority to amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the 2021 Plan or terminate the 2021 Plan at any time before the date of expiration\nof its ten year term.\nThe 2021 Plan provides for granting awards under various tax regimes, including, without limitation, for awards granted to our Israeli employees or service providers, in\ncompliance with Section 102 of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance (New Version), 1961 (the “Ordinance”) or Section 3(i) of the Ordinance and for awards granted to our United\nStates employees or service providers, including those who are deemed to be residents of the United States for tax purposes, Section 422 of the Code and Section 409A of the Code.\nSection 102 of the Ordinance allows employees, directors and officers who are not “controlling shareholders” (as used under the Ordinance) and are considered Israeli residents\nto receive favorable tax treatment for compensation in the form of shares or options. Our non-employee service providers and controlling shareholders may only be granted options\nunder section 3(i) of the Ordinance, which does not provide for similar tax benefits.\nThe 2021 Plan provides for the grant of stock options (including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options), ordinary shares, restricted shares, restricted share\nunits, performance restricted share units and other stock-based awards. Options granted under the 2021 Plan to our employees who are U.S. residents may qualify as “incentive stock\noptions” within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code or may be non-qualified stock options.\nClawback Policy\nIn 2023, we adopted a Clawback Policy in compliance with the SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards to recover any excess incentive-based compensation from current and\nformer executive officers after an accounting restatement.\n59\nC. Board Practices\nBoard of Directors\nUnder the Companies Law and our Articles, our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our board of directors. Our board of directors may exercise all powers\nand may take all actions that are not specifically granted to our shareholders or to executive management. Our Chief Executive Officer (referred to as a “general manager” under the\nCompanies Law) is responsible for our day-to-day management. Our Chief Executive Officer is appointed by, and serves at the discretion of, our board of directors. All other\nexecutive officers are appointed by the Chief Executive Officer and are subject to the terms of any applicable employment or consulting agreements that we may enter into with them.\nUnder our Articles, our directors are divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. Each class of directors consists, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total\nnumber of directors constituting the entire board of directors. At each annual general meeting of our shareholders, the election or re-election of directors following the expiration of\nthe term of office of the directors of that class of directors will be for a term of office that expires on the third annual general meeting following such election or re-election, such that\neach year the term of office of only one class of directors will expire.\nFurther, our Articles include a provision which provides that Perception has the right to appoint one director to our board of directors upon closing of the Business Combination\n(the “Perception Director”) and for so long as it beneficially owns at least 50% of the total number of ordinary shares it beneficially owned at the date of the closing of the Business\nCombination. Mr. Sheridan was appointed as the Perception Director.\nOur directors, other than the Perception Director, are divided among the three classes as follows:\n• the Class I directors are Aharon Aharon, Stefan Jacoby and Orit Stav and their terms expire at our annual general meeting to be held in 2024;\n• the Class II directors are Dan Falk and Ronit Maor and their terms expire at our annual general meeting to be held in 2025; and\n• the Class III directors are Amichai Steimberg, Omer Keilaf and Alexander von Witzleben and their terms expire at our annual general meeting to be held in 2026.\n60\nDirector Independence\nAs an Israeli company, our company is subject to various corporate governance requirements under the Companies Law. However, pursuant to regulations promulgated under\nthe Companies Law, companies with shares traded on certain U.S. stock exchanges, including Nasdaq, may, subject to certain conditions, opt out from the Companies Law\nrequirements to appoint external directors and related Companies Law rules concerning the composition of the audit committee, compensation committee and nominating,\nenvironmental, social and governance committee of the board of directors (other than the gender diversification rule under the Companies Law, which requires the appointment of a\ndirector from the other gender if at the time a director is appointed all members of the board of directors are of the same gender). In accordance with these regulations, we have\nelected to opt out of those requirements of the Companies Law. These exemptions will continue to be available to our company so long as: (i) we do not have a “controlling\nshareholder” as used under the Companies Law, (ii) our shares are traded on certain U.S. stock exchanges, including Nasdaq, and (iii) we comply with the director independence\nrequirements and the audit committee, compensation committee and nominating, environmental, social and governance committee composition requirements under U.S. laws\n(including applicable Nasdaq rules) applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\nThe term “controlling shareholder” as used in the Companies Law for purposes related to external directors and for the requirements related to appointment to the audit\ncommittee, compensation committee or nominating, environmental, social and governance committee, as described below, means a shareholder with the ability to direct the activities\nof the company, other than by virtue of being an office holder. A shareholder is presumed to be a controlling shareholder if the shareholder holds 50% or more of the voting rights in a\ncompany or has the right to appoint the majority of the directors of the company or its general manager. With respect to certain matters (including various related party transactions),\na controlling shareholder is deemed to include a shareholder that holds 25% or more of the voting rights in a public company if no other shareholder holds more than 50% of the\nvoting rights in the company, but excludes a shareholder whose power derives solely from his or her position as a director of the company or from any other position with the\ncompany.\nAccordingly, we comply with Nasdaq rule 5605(b)(1), which requires that the board of directors be comprised of a majority of independent directors. A majority of our board of\ndirectors is composed of directors who are “independent” as defined by the rules of Nasdaq and all of the non-management directors qualify as “independent” under these standards.\nThe board of directors has established categorical standards to assist it in making its determination of director independence. We use the definition of “independence” of Nasdaq to\nmake this determination. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an “independent director” is a person other than an officer or employee of our company or any other\nindividual having a relationship which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a\ndirector. The Nasdaq rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:\n• the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of our company;\n• the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from our company in excess of $120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within\nthe three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee\nservice);\n• a family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of our company;\n• the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling shareholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which our company made, or from which\nour company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient’s consolidated gross revenue for that year or\n$200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions);\n• the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive\nofficers of our company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or\n• the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of our outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of our\noutside auditor, and who worked on our audit.\n61\nUnder the following three Nasdaq director independence rules a director is not considered independent: (a) Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2)(A), a director is not considered to be\nindependent if he or she also is an executive officer or employee of our company, (b) Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2)(B), a director is not considered independent if he or she accepted any\ncompensation from our company in excess of $120,000 during any period of twelve consecutive months within the three years preceding the determination of independence, and\n(c) Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2)(D), a director is not considered to be independent if he or she is a partner in, or a controlling shareholder or an executive officer of, any organization to\nwhich our company made, or from which our company received, payments for property or services in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient’s\nconsolidated gross revenues for that year, or $200,000. Under such definitions, we have seven independent directors.\nThe board of directors assesses on a regular basis, and at least annually, the independence of directors and makes a determination as to which members are independent.\nReferences to “our company” above include any subsidiary in a consolidated group with our company. The terms “immediate family member” and “executive officer” above have the\nsame meanings specified for such terms in the Nasdaq listing standards.\nHowever, as a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to comply with Israeli corporate governance practices instead of the Nasdaq corporate governance rules, provided that we\ndisclose which requirements we are not following and the equivalent Israeli requirement. We intend to rely on this “home country practice exemption” solely with respect to the\nquorum requirement for shareholder meetings. As permitted under the Companies Law, pursuant to our Articles, the quorum required for an ordinary meeting of shareholders will\nconsist of at least two shareholders present in person, by proxy or by other voting instrument in accordance with the Companies Law, who hold at least 25% of the voting power of its\nshares (and in an adjourned meeting, with some exceptions, any number of shareholders), instead of 33 1/3% of the issued share capital required under the Nasdaq corporate\ngovernance rules. We otherwise comply with the rules generally applicable to U.S. domestic companies listed on Nasdaq. We may in the future decide to use the foreign private issuer\nexemption with respect to some or all of the other corporate governance rules.\nChairperson of the Board\nOur Articles provide that the chairperson of the board of directors is appointed by the members of the board of directors and serves as chairperson of the board of directors\nthroughout his or her term as a director, unless resolved otherwise by the board of directors. Under the Companies Law, the chief executive officer (or any relative of the chief\nexecutive officer) may not serve as the chairperson of the board of directors, and the chairperson (or any relative of the chairperson) may not be vested with authorities of the chief\nexecutive officer without shareholder approval, for periods of up to three years each, consisting of a majority vote of the shares present and voting at a shareholders\nmeeting, provided that either:\n• at least a majority of the shares of non-controlling shareholders or shareholders that do not have a personal interest in the approval voted at the meeting are voted in\nfavor (disregarding abstentions); or\n• the total number of shares of non-controlling shareholders and shareholders who do not have a personal interest in such appointment voting against such appointment\ndoes not exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights in the Company.\nIn addition, a person subordinated, directly or indirectly, to the chief executive officer may not serve as the chairperson of the board of directors; the chairperson of the board of\ndirectors may not be vested with authorities that are granted to those subordinated to the chief executive officer; and the chairperson of the board of directors may not serve in any\nother position in the Company or a controlled company, but he may serve as a director or chairperson of a subsidiary.\nExternal Directors\nUnder the Companies Law, companies incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel that are public companies, including companies with shares listed on Nasdaq, are\nrequired to appoint at least two external directors who must meet heightened independence requirements. Pursuant to regulations promulgated under the Companies Law, companies\nwith shares traded on certain U.S. stock exchanges, including Nasdaq, may, subject to certain conditions, opt out from the Companies Law requirements to appoint external directors\nand related Companies Law rules concerning the composition of the audit committee, compensation committee and nominating, environmental, social and governance committee of\nthe board of directors. In accordance with these regulations, we elected to opt out from these Companies Law requirements. Instead, we must comply with the director independence\nrequirements, the audit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating, environmental, social and governance committee composition requirements under U.S. laws\n(including applicable Nasdaq rules) applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\n62\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has the following standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating, environmental, social and governance\ncommittee.\nAudit Committee\nThe audit committee is responsible, among its other duties and responsibilities, for overseeing our accounting and financial reporting processes, audits of financial statements,\nqualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the performance of the internal\naudit function and independent registered public accounting firm. The audit committee reviews and assesses the qualitative aspects of our financial reporting, processes to manage\nbusiness and financial risks, and compliance with significant applicable legal, ethical and regulatory requirements. The audit committee is directly responsible for the appointment,\ncompensation, retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, the audit committee is responsible for the following additional matters\npursuant to the Companies Law:\n• recommending to the board of directors the retention and termination of the internal auditor, and the internal auditor’s engagement fees and terms, in accordance with\nthe Companies Law as well as approving the yearly or periodic work plan proposed by the internal auditor;\n• reviewing with our general counsel and/or external counsel, as deemed necessary, legal and regulatory matters that could have a material impact on the financial\nstatements;\n• identifying irregularities in our business administration, including by consulting with the internal auditor or with the independent auditor, and suggesting corrective\nmeasures to the board of directors;\n• reviewing policies and procedures with respect to transactions (other than transactions related to the compensation or terms of services) between the Company and\nofficers and directors, or affiliates of officers or directors, or transactions that are not in the ordinary course of the Company’s business and deciding whether to approve\nsuch acts and transactions if so required under the Companies Law; and\n• establishing procedures for the handling of employees’ complaints as to the management of our business and the protection to be provided to such employees.\nThe charter of the audit committee is available without charge at https://ir.innoviz.tech.\nThe members of the audit committee are Dan Falk, Ronit Maor and Orit Stav. Dan Falk serves as the chairperson of the audit committee. The board of directors has designated\nDan Falk as an “audit committee financial expert” and determined that each member is “financially literate” under the Nasdaq rules. The board of directors has also determined that\neach member of the audit committee is “independent” as defined under the Nasdaq rules and Exchange Act rules and regulations.\nCompensation Committee\nThe compensation committee is responsible, among its other duties and responsibilities, for reviewing and approving all forms of compensation to be provided to, and\nemployment agreements with, our executive officers and directors, establishing the general compensation policies of our company and its subsidiaries and reviewing, approving and\noverseeing the administration of the employee benefits plans of our company and its subsidiaries. The compensation committee is also responsible for:\n• recommending to the board of directors with respect to the approval of the compensation policy for “office holders” (a term used under the Companies Law, which\nmeans, in effect, directors and executive officers) and, once every three years, regarding any extensions to a compensation policy that has been in effect for a period of\nmore than three years;\n63\n• reviewing the implementation of the compensation policy and periodically recommending to the board of directors with respect to any amendments or updates of the\ncompensation plan;\n• resolving whether or not to approve arrangements with respect to the terms of office and employment of office holders; and\n• exempting, under certain circumstances, from the requirement of approval by the general meeting of shareholders, transactions with the chief executive officer of our\ncompany.\nThe charter of the compensation committee is available without charge at https://ir.innoviz.tech\nThe members of the compensation committee are Ronit Maor and Dan Falk. Ronit Maor serves as the chairperson of the compensation committee. The board of directors has\ndetermined that each member of the compensation committee is “independent” as defined under the Nasdaq listing standards. The compensation committee has the authority to retain\ncompensation consultants, outside counsel and other advisers.\nCompensation Policy Under the Companies Law\nIn general, under the Companies Law, a public company must have a compensation policy approved by the board of directors after receiving and considering the\nrecommendations of the compensation committee. In addition, a compensation policy must be approved at least once every three years, first, by the public company’s board of\ndirectors, upon recommendation of its compensation committee, and second, by a simple majority of the ordinary shares present, in person or by proxy, and voting at a shareholders\nmeeting, provided that either:\n• such majority includes at least a majority of the shares held by shareholders who are not controlling shareholders and do not have a personal interest in such\ncompensation policy and who are present and voting (excluding abstentions); or\n• the total number of shares of non-controlling shareholders and shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the compensation policy and who vote against the\npolicy, does not exceed 2% of the company’s aggregate voting rights.\nIn the event that the shareholders fail to approve the compensation policy in a duly convened meeting, the board of directors may nevertheless override that decision, provided\nthat the compensation committee and then the board of directors decide, on the basis of detailed reasons and after further review of the compensation policy, that approval of the\ncompensation policy is for the benefit of the company despite the failure of the shareholders to approve the policy.\nIf a company that adopts a compensation policy in advance of its initial public offering (or in our case, prior to the closing of the Business Combination) describes the policy in\nits prospectus for such offering, then that compensation policy shall be deemed validly adopted in accordance with the Companies Law and will remain in effect for term of five years\nfrom the date such company becomes a public company.\nThe compensation policy must serve as the basis for decisions concerning the financial terms of employment or engagement of office holders, including exculpation, insurance,\nindemnification or any monetary payment or obligation of payment in respect of employment or engagement. The compensation policy must relate to certain factors, including\nadvancement of the company’s objectives, business plan and long-term strategy, and creation of appropriate incentives for office holders. It must also consider, among other things,\nthe company’s risk management, size and the nature of its operations. The compensation policy must furthermore consider the following additional factors:\n• the education, skills, experience, expertise and accomplishments of the relevant office holder;\n• the office holder’s position, responsibilities and prior compensation agreements with him or her;\n• the ratio between the cost of the terms of employment of an office holder and the cost of the employment of other employees of the company, including employees\nemployed through contractors who provide services to the company, in particular the ratio between such cost, the average and median salary of the employees of the\ncompany, as well as the impact of such disparities on the work relationships in the company;\n• if the terms of employment include variable components—the possibility of reducing variable components at the discretion of the board of directors and the\npossibility of setting a limit on the value of non-cash variable equity-based components; and\n• if the terms of employment include severance compensation—the term of employment or office of the office holder, the terms of his or her compensation during\nsuch period, the company’s performance during such period, his or her individual contribution to the achievement of the company goals and the maximization of its\nprofits and the circumstances under which he or she is leaving the company.\n64\nThe compensation policy must also include, among other things:\n• with regard to variable components of compensation:\n• with the exception of office holders who report directly to the chief executive officer, provisions determining the variable components on the basis of long-term\nperformance and on measurable criteria; however, the company may determine that an immaterial part of the variable components of the compensation package of\nan office holder shall be awarded based on non-measurable criteria, if such amount is not higher than three monthly salaries per annum, while taking into account\nsuch office holder’s contribution to the company; and\n• the ratio between variable and fixed components, as well as the limit on the values of variable components at the time of their grant.\n• a condition under which the office holder will return to the company, according to conditions to be set forth in the compensation policy, any amounts paid as part of his\nor her terms of employment, if such amounts were paid based on information later to be discovered to be wrong, and such information was restated in the company’s\nfinancial statements;\n• the minimum holding or vesting period of variable equity-based components to be set in the terms of office or employment, as applicable, while taking into\nconsideration long-term incentives; and\n• a limit on retirement grants.\nOur compensation policy, which became effective immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination, is designed to promote retention and motivation of\ndirectors and executive officers, incentivize superior individual excellence, align the interests of our directors and executive officers with our long-term performance and provide a\nrisk management tool. To that end, a portion of an executive officer compensation package is targeted to reflect our short and long-term goals, as well as the executive officer’s\nindividual performance. On the other hand, our compensation policy includes measures designed to reduce an executive officer’s incentives to take excessive risks that may harm us\nin the long-term, such as limits on the value of cash bonuses and equity-based compensation, limitations on the ratio between the variable and the total compensation of an executive\nofficer and minimum vesting periods for equity-based compensation.\nThe compensation policy also addresses our executive officers’ individual characteristics (such as their respective positions, education, scope of responsibilities and\ncontribution to the attainment of its goals) as the basis for compensation variation among our executive officers and considers the internal ratios between compensation of our\nexecutive officers and directors and other employees. Pursuant to our compensation policy, the compensation that may be granted to an executive officer may include: base salary,\nannual bonuses and other cash bonuses (such as a signing bonus and special bonuses with respect to any special achievements, such as outstanding personal achievement, outstanding\npersonal effort or outstanding company performance), equity-based compensation, benefits and retirement and termination of service arrangements. All cash bonuses are limited to a\nmaximum amount linked to the executive officer’s base salary. In addition, the total variable compensation components (cash bonuses and equity-based compensation) may not\nexceed 95% of each executive officer’s total compensation package with respect to any given calendar year.\nAn annual cash bonus may be awarded to executive officers upon the attainment of pre-set periodic objectives and individual targets. The annual cash bonus that may be\ngranted to our executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer will be based on performance objectives and a discretionary evaluation of the executive officer’s overall\nperformance by the Chief Executive Officer and subject to minimum thresholds. The annual cash bonus that may be granted to executive officers other than our Chief Executive\nOfficer may be based entirely on a discretionary evaluation. Furthermore, our Chief Executive Officer is entitled to recommend performance objectives, and such performance\nobjectives will be approved by the compensation committee (and, if required by law, by our board of directors).\nThe measurable performance objectives of our Chief Executive Officer may be determined annually by our compensation committee and board of directors and include the\nweight to be assigned to each achievement in the overall evaluation. A less significant portion of the Chief Executive Officer’s annual cash bonus may be based on a discretionary\nevaluation of the Chief Executive Officer’s overall performance by the compensation committee and the board of directors based on quantitative and qualitative criteria.\n65\nThe equity-based compensation under the compensation policy for our executive officers is designed in a manner consistent with the underlying objectives in determining the\nbase salary and the annual cash bonus. Primary objectives include enhancing the alignment between the executive officers’ interests and our long-term interests and those of our\nshareholders and strengthening the retention and the motivation of executive officers in the long term. Our compensation policy provides for executive officer compensation in the\nform of share options or other equity-based awards, such as restricted shares, restricted share units and performance share units, in accordance with our share incentive plan then in\nplace. All equity-based incentives granted to executive officers shall be subject to vesting periods and/or performance milestones in order to promote long-term retention of the\nawarded executive officers. Equity-based compensation shall be granted from time to time and be individually determined and awarded according to the performance, educational\nbackground, prior business experience, qualifications, role and the personal responsibilities of the executive officer.\nIn addition, the compensation policy contains compensation recovery provisions which allows us under certain conditions to recover bonuses paid in excess, enables our Chief\nExecutive Officer to approve immaterial changes in the terms of employment of an executive officer (provided that the changes of the terms of employment are in accordance our\ncompensation policy) and allows us to exculpate, indemnify and insure our executive officers and directors subject to certain limitations as set forth therein.\nThe compensation policy also provides for compensation to the members of our board of directors either (i) in accordance with the amounts provided in the Companies\nRegulations (Rules Regarding the Compensation and Expenses of an External Director) of 2000, as amended by the Companies Regulations (Relief for Public Companies Traded in\nStock Exchange Outside of Israel) of 2000, as such regulations may be amended from time to time, or (ii) in accordance with the amounts determined in the compensation policy.\nOur compensation policy, which was approved by our board of directors and shareholders on January 20, 2021 and January 29, 2021, respectively, became effective upon the\nclosing of the Business Combination.\nNominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee\nThe members of the nominating, environmental, social and governance committee are Orit Stav and Aharon Aharon. Orit Stav serves as the chairperson of the nominating,\nenvironmental, social and governance committee. The nominating, environmental, social and governance committee is responsible, among other things, for:\n• identify, review and evaluate candidates to serve as members of our board of directors, recommend to our board of directors nominees for election as directors of the\nCompany, and review and evaluate incumbent members of the board of directors;\n• make recommendations to our board of directors regarding corporate governance guidelines and matters;\n• oversee all aspects of the Company’s corporate governance functions and ethical conduct; and\n• oversee the Company’s programs and strategies related to environmental, social and governance matters.\nThe charter of the nominating, environmental, social and governance committee is available without charge at https://ir.innoviz.tech.\nExculpation, Insurance and Indemnification of Office Holders\nUnder the Companies Law, a company may not exculpate an office holder from liability for a breach of the duty of loyalty. An Israeli company may exculpate an office holder\nin advance from liability, in whole or in part, for damages caused as a result of a breach of duty of care but only if a provision authorizing such exculpation is included in its articles\nof association. Our Articles include such a provision. An Israeli company may not exculpate a director from liability arising out of a prohibited dividend or distribution to\nshareholders.\nAn Israeli company may indemnify an office holder in respect of the following liabilities and expenses incurred for acts performed as an office holder, either in advance of an\nevent or following an event, provided a provision authorizing such indemnification is contained in its articles of association:\n• a financial liability imposed on him or her in favor of another person pursuant to a judgment, including a settlement or arbitrator’s award approved by a court. However,\nif an undertaking to indemnify an office holder with respect to such liability is provided in advance, then such an undertaking must be limited to events which, in the\nopinion of the board of directors, can be foreseen based on the company’s activities when the undertaking to indemnify is given, and to an amount or according to\ncriteria determined by the board of directors as reasonable under the circumstances, and such undertaking shall detail the abovementioned events and amount or criteria;\n66\n• reasonable litigation expenses, including legal fees, incurred by the office holder (1) as a result of an investigation or proceeding instituted against him or her by an\nauthority authorized to conduct such investigation or proceeding, provided that (i) no indictment was filed against such office holder as a result of such investigation or\nproceeding; and (ii) no financial liability, such as a criminal penalty, was imposed upon him or her as a substitute for the criminal proceeding as a result of such\ninvestigation or proceeding or, if such financial liability was imposed, it was imposed with respect to an offense that does not require proof of criminal intent; and (2) in\nconnection with a monetary sanction;\n• reasonable litigation expenses, including legal fees, incurred by the office holder or imposed by a court in proceedings instituted against him or her by the company, on\nits behalf or by a third-party or in connection with criminal proceedings in which the office holder was acquitted or as a result of a conviction for an offense that does\nnot require proof of criminal intent; and\n• expenses, including reasonable litigation expenses and legal fees, incurred by an office holder in relation to an administrative proceeding instituted against such office\nholder, or certain compensation payments made to an injured party imposed on an office holder by an administrative proceeding, pursuant to certain provisions of the\nIsraeli Securities Law, 1968 (the “Israeli Securities Law”).\nAn Israeli company may insure an office holder against the following liabilities incurred for acts performed as an office holder if and to the extent provided in the company’s\narticles of association:\n• a breach of the duty of loyalty to the company, to the extent that the office holder acted in good faith and had a reasonable basis to believe that the act would not\nprejudice the company;\n• a breach of the duty of care to the company or to a third-party, including a breach arising out of the negligent conduct of the office holder;\n• a financial liability imposed on the office holder in favor of a third-party;\n• a financial liability imposed on the office holder in favor of a third-party harmed by a breach in an administrative proceeding; and\n• expenses, including reasonable litigation expenses and legal fees, incurred by the office holder as a result of an administrative proceeding instituted against him or her,\npursuant to certain provisions of the Israeli Securities Law.\nAn Israeli company may not indemnify or insure an office holder against any of the following:\n• a breach of the duty of loyalty, except to the extent that the office holder acted in good faith and had a reasonable basis to believe that the act would not prejudice the\ncompany;\n• a breach of the duty of care committed intentionally or recklessly, excluding a breach arising out of the negligent conduct of the office holder;\n• an act or omission committed with intent to derive illegal personal benefit; or\n• a fine, monetary sanction or forfeit levied against the office holder.\nUnder the Companies Law, exculpation, indemnification and insurance of office holders must be approved by the compensation committee and the board of directors (and, with\nrespect to directors and the chief executive officer, by the shareholders). However, under regulations promulgated under the Companies Law, the insurance of office holders does not\nrequire shareholder approval and may be approved by only the compensation committee, if the engagement terms are determined in accordance with the company’s compensation\npolicy, which was approved by the shareholders by the same special majority required to approve a compensation policy, provided that the insurance policy is on market terms and\nthe insurance policy is not likely to materially impact the company’s profitability, assets or obligations.\nOur Articles allow us to exculpate, indemnify and insure our office holders for any liability imposed on them as a consequence of an act (including any omission) which was\nperformed by virtue of being an office holder to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Our office holders are currently covered by a directors and officers’ liability\ninsurance policy.\nWe have entered into agreements with certain of our directors and executive officers exculpating them in advance from liability to us for damages caused to us as a result of a\nbreach of duty of care, and undertaking to indemnify them to the fullest extent permitted by law. This indemnification is limited to events determined as foreseeable by the board of\ndirectors based on our activities, and to an amount or according to criteria determined by the board of directors as reasonable under the circumstances.\n67\nThe maximum indemnification amount set forth in such agreements is limited to an amount equal to the higher of $40,000,000 and 25% of our total shareholders’ equity on a\nconsolidated basis as reflected in our most recent consolidated financial statements prior to the date on which the indemnity payment is made (other than indemnification for an\noffering of securities to the public, including by a shareholder in a secondary offering, in which case the maximum indemnification amount is limited to the gross proceeds raised by\nus and/or any selling shareholder in such public offering). The maximum amount set forth in such agreements is in addition to any amount paid (if paid) under insurance and/or by\na third-party pursuant to an indemnification arrangement.\nIn the opinion of the SEC, indemnification of directors and office holders for liabilities arising under the Securities Act, however, is against public policy and therefore\nunenforceable.\nThere is no pending litigation or proceeding against any of our office holders as to which indemnification is being sought, nor are we aware of any pending or threatened\nlitigation that may result in claims for indemnification by any office holder.\nInternal Auditor\nUnder the Companies Law, the board of directors of a public company must appoint an internal auditor based on the recommendation of the audit committee. The role of the\ninternal auditor is, among other things, to examine whether a company’s actions comply with applicable law and orderly business procedure. Under the Companies Law, the internal\nauditor cannot be an interested party or an office holder or a relative of an interested party or an office holder, nor may the internal auditor be the company’s independent auditor or its\nrepresentative. An “interested party” is defined in the Companies Law as: (i) a holder of 5% or more of the issued share capital or voting power in a company, (ii) any person or entity\nwho has the right to designate one or more directors or to designate the chief executive officer of the company, or (iii) any person who serves as a director or as a chief executive\nofficer of the company.\nMs. Sharon Cohen, CPA from Deloitte IL & Co, a firm in the Deloitte Global Network serves as our internal auditor.\nD. Employees\nWe believe that our corporate culture and our relationship with our employees contribute to our success. Our employees are continuously innovating, and our structure rewards\nproductivity. As of December 31, 2023, we had 488 employees.\nOn January 31, 2024, we announced a strategic realignment of our operations to expand our cash runway and optimize our path towards profitability and free cash flow\ngeneration, which included a reduction in the company’s headcount by approximately 13% during the first quarter of 2024.\nIn regard to our Israeli employees, Israeli labor laws govern the length of the workday, minimum wages for employees, procedures for hiring and dismissing employees,\ndetermination of severance pay, annual leave, sick days, advance notice of termination of employment, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws and other conditions of\nemployment. Subject to certain exceptions, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the retirement, death or dismissal of an employee, and requires us and our employees to\nmake payments to the National Insurance Institute, which is similar to the U.S. Social Security Administration. Our employees have pension plans that comply with applicable Israeli\nlegal requirements, and we make monthly contributions to severance pay funds for all employees, which cover potential severance pay obligations.\nNone of our employees work under any collective bargaining agreements. Extension orders issued by the Israeli government apply to us and affect matters such as cost of living\nadjustments to salaries, length of working hours and week, recuperation pay, travel expenses and pension rights.\nWe have never experienced labor-related work stoppages or strikes and believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.\nE. Share Ownership\nFor information regarding the share ownership of directors and officers, see Item 7.A. “Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” For\ninformation as to our equity incentive plans, see Item 6.B. “Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers —Share Option\nPlans.”\nF.

All meetings other than the annual general meeting of shareholders are referred to in our Articles as “special general meetings”. Our board of\ndirectors may call special general meetings whenever it sees fit, at such time and place, within or outside of Israel, as it may determine. In addition, the Companies Law provides that\nour board of directors is required to convene a special general meeting upon the written request of (i) any two or more of our directors or one-quarter or more of the serving members\nof our board of directors or (ii) one or more shareholders holding, in the aggregate, either (a) 5% or more of our outstanding issued shares and 1% or more of our outstanding voting\npower or (b) 5% or more of our outstanding voting power.\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder, shareholders entitled to participate and vote at general meetings are the\nshareholders of record on a date to be decided by the board of directors, which, as a company listed on an exchange outside Israel, may be between four and 40 days prior to the date\nof the meeting. Furthermore, the Companies Law requires that resolutions regarding the following matters must be passed at a general meeting of our shareholders:\n• amendments to our articles of association;\n• appointment, termination or the terms of service of our auditors;\n• appointment of external directors (if applicable);\n• approval of certain related party transactions;\n• increases or reductions of our authorized share capital;\n• mergers; and\n• the exercise of our board of director’s powers by a general meeting, if our board of directors is unable to exercise its powers and the exercise of any of its powers is\nrequired for our proper management.\nThe Companies Law requires that a notice of any annual general meeting or special general meeting be provided to shareholders at least 21 days prior to the meeting and if the\nagenda of the meeting includes, among other things, the appointment or removal of directors, the approval of transactions with office holders or interested or related parties or the\napproval of a merger, notice must be provided at least 35 days prior to the meeting. Under the Companies Law, shareholders are not permitted to take action by way of written\nconsent in lieu of a meeting.\n73\nC.

This agreement provides the framework for the collaboration between Magna as a leading Tier-1\npartner and our company as a leading LiDAR company. The initial term of this agreement is eight years with automatic renewals of 1-year periods thereafter, subject in\neach case to mutual termination rights in the event of material breach, insolvency or bankruptcy.\n• BMW SOW\nIn connection with the JDMSA, in February 2018, we entered into the BMW SOW with Magna Electronics Europe GmbH & Co.

Serial production volumes will ultimately be highly dependent on\nnumerous factors and therefore are binding only upon issuance of a purchase order.\nIn 2019, the parties signed an amendment to the BMW SOW (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.17 to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form F-4 (File No.\n333-252023) filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021), under which BMW advanced certain payments due under the BMW SOW in consideration for development\nactivities and delivery of early samples to Magna Electronics Europe by the end of August 2019.\n74\n• Magna Manufacturing MOU\nIn October 2020, Innoviz signed a memorandum of understanding with Magna Electronics Technology, Inc. (the “Magna MOU”) (incorporated by reference to Exhibit\n10.18 to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form F-4 (File No. 333-252023) filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021) for high-volume manufacturing of Innoviz\nLiDARs at Magna’s automotive grade facility in Holly, Michigan. The Magna MOU contemplates Magna’s manufacturing of our LiDAR solution for the BMW program.\nThe MOU has been in effect since October 2020 and has been periodically extended until replaced by the Magna Agreement, as set forth below.\n• Lease Agreement\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Rosh HaAin, Israel, where we currently lease an office with approximately 16,350 square meters pursuant to the Lease\nAgreement (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 4.14 to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on March\n30, 2022). This facility contains engineering, research and development, testing, product, sales and administrative functions. The initial term under the Lease Agreement is\nfor 67 months and expires on January 31, 2028. We have an option under the Lease Agreement to renew the lease for additional 60 months, which will be exercised\nautomatically unless we inform the lessor in advance.\n• Electronic Nomination Agreement with Cariad SE (a Volkswagen group company)\nIn December 2022, Innoviz and Cariad SE executed an electronic nomination agreement (the “eNA”) (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 4.15 to the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 20-F for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 9, 2023) pursuant to which Cariad commissioned Innoviz to develop,\nmanufacture and deliver InnovizTwo LiDARs.\nCariad has the right to terminate the eNA under certain circumstances, including (a) if Innoviz does not meet the prerequisites for series production of the products that are\nthe subject matter of the eNA, and (b) if Innoviz enters into insolvency proceedings.\n• Agreement with Magna regarding Manufacturing of InnovizOne for the BMW Program\nIn December 2023, Innoviz signed an agreement with Magna Electronics Technology, Inc., and Magna Electronics Europe GmbH & Co. OHG (the “Magna Agreement”),\naddressing the high-volume manufacturing of Innoviz LiDARs at Magna’s automotive grade facility in Holly, Michigan, for the BMW program.\nD. Exchange Controls\nThere are currently no Israeli currency control restrictions on remittances of dividends on our ordinary shares, proceeds from the sale of the ordinary shares or interest or other\npayments to non-residents of Israel, except for shareholders who are subjects of countries that are, or have been, in a state of war with Israel.\nE. Taxation\nTaxation and Government Programs\nThe following description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares\nand warrants. You should consult your own tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences that may arise under the laws of\nany state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction.\n75\nMaterial Israeli Tax Considerations\nThe following is a brief summary of the material Israeli tax laws applicable to us, and certain Israeli Government programs that benefit us. This section also contains a\ndiscussion of material Israeli tax consequences concerning the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares. This summary does not discuss all the aspects of Israeli tax\nlaw that may be relevant to a particular investor in light of his or her personal investment circumstances or to some types of investors subject to special treatment under Israeli law.\nExamples of such investors include residents of Israel or traders in securities who are subject to special tax regimes not covered in this discussion. To the extent that the discussion is\nbased on tax legislation that has not yet been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation, we cannot assure you that the appropriate tax authorities or the courts will accept the\nviews expressed in this discussion. The discussion below is subject to change, including due to amendments under Israeli law or changes to the applicable judicial or administrative\ninterpretations of Israeli law, which change could affect the tax consequences described below.\nGeneral corporate tax structure in Israel. Israeli companies are generally subject to corporate income tax. In December 2016, the Israeli Parliament approved the Economic\nEfficiency Law (Legislative Amendments for Applying the Economic Policy for the 2017 and 2018 Budget Years) which reduces the corporate income tax rate from 25% to 24%\neffective from January 1, 2017, and to 23% effective from January 1, 2018 onwards. However, the effective tax rate payable by a company that derives income from an Approved\nEnterprise, a Preferred Enterprise, a Special Preferred Enterprise, a Benefited Enterprise, a Preferred Technological Enterprise or Special Preferred Technological Enterprise (as\ndiscussed below) may be considerably less. Capital gains derived by an Israeli company are generally subject to the corporate income tax rate.\nLaw for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 5729-1969. The Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 5729-1969, generally referred to as the Industry\nEncouragement Law, provides several tax benefits for “Industrial Companies.” We believe that we currently qualify as an Industrial Company within the meaning of the Industry\nEncouragement Law.\nThe Industry Encouragement Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder provide that an “Industrial Company” is an Israeli resident-company, of which 90% or more of\nits income in any tax year, other than income from certain government loans, capital gains, dividends and interest and linkage differentials, is derived from an “Industrial Enterprise”\nowned by it and located in Israel or in the “Area”, in accordance with the definition under section 3A of the Ordinance. An “Industrial Enterprise” is defined as an enterprise whose\nprincipal activity in a given tax year is industrial production.\nFollowing are the main tax benefits available to Industrial Companies:\n• Amortization of the cost of purchased patents, rights to use a patent, and know-how, which are used for the development or advancement of the Industrial Enterprise,\nover an eight-year period, commencing on the year in which the Industrial Company began to use them;\n• Under limited conditions, an election to file consolidated tax returns with controlled Israeli Industrial Companies; and\n• Expenses related to a public offering are deductible in equal amounts over three years commencing on the year of the offering.\nEligibility for benefits under the Industry Encouragement Law is not contingent upon approval of any governmental authority.\nTax benefits and grants for research and development. Israeli tax law allows, under certain conditions, a tax deduction for expenditures, including capital expenditures, for the\nyear in which they are incurred. Expenditures are deemed related to scientific research and development projects, if:\n• The expenditures are approved by the relevant Israeli government ministry, determined by the field of research;\n• The research and development must be for the promotion of the company; and\n• The research and development is carried out by or on behalf of the company seeking such tax deduction.\nThe amount of such deductible expenses is reduced by the sum of any funds received through government grants for the finance of such scientific research and development\nprojects. No deduction under these research and development deduction rules is allowed if such deduction is related to an expense invested in an asset depreciable under the general\ndepreciation rules of the Ordinance. Expenditures that are unqualified under the conditions above are deductible in equal amounts over three years commencing in the year of the\npayment of such expenses.\n76\nFrom time to time we may apply to the IIA for approval to allow a tax deduction for all or most of research and development expenses during the year incurred. There can be\nno assurance that such application will be accepted. If we will not be able to deduct research and development expenses during the year of the payment, we will be able to deduct\nresearch and development expenses during a period of three years commencing in the year of the payment of such expenses.\nLaw for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 5719-1959. The Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 5719-1959, generally referred to as the Investment\nLaw, provides certain incentives for capital investments in production facilities (or other eligible assets).\nThe Investment Law was significantly amended effective as of April 1, 2005 (the “2005 Amendment”), as of January 1, 2011 (the “2011 Amendment”) and as of January 1,\n2017 (the “2017 Amendment”). Pursuant to the 2005 Amendment, tax benefits granted in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law prior to its revision by the 2005\nAmendment remain in force, but any benefits granted subsequently are subject to the provisions of the amended Investment Law. Similarly, the 2011 Amendment introduced new\nbenefits to replace those granted in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law in effect prior to the 2011 Amendment. However, companies entitled to benefits under the\nInvestment Law as in effect prior to January 1, 2011 were entitled to choose to continue to enjoy such benefits, provided that certain conditions are met, or elect instead, irrevocably,\nto forego such benefits and have the benefits of the 2011 Amendment apply. The 2017 Amendment introduces new benefits for Technological Enterprises, alongside the existing tax\nbenefits.\nTax benefits under the 2011 amendment. The 2011 Amendment cancelled the availability of the benefits granted to Industrial Companies under the Investment Law prior to\n2011 and, instead, introduced new benefits for income generated by a “Preferred Company” through its “Preferred Enterprise” (as such terms are defined in the Investment Law) as of\nJanuary 1, 2011. The definition of a Preferred Company includes a company incorporated in Israel that is not fully owned by a governmental entity, and that has, among other things,\nPreferred Enterprise status and is controlled and managed from Israel. Pursuant to the 2011 Amendment, a Preferred Company is entitled to a reduced corporate tax rate of 15% with\nrespect to its income derived by its Preferred Enterprise in 2011 and 2012, unless the Preferred Enterprise is located in a specified development zone, in which case the rate will be\n10%. Under the 2011 Amendment, such corporate tax rate was reduced from 15% and 10%, respectively, to 12.5% and 7%, respectively, in 2013, 16% and 9% respectively, in 2014,\n2015 and 2016, and 16% and 7.5%, respectively, in 2017 and thereafter. Income derived by a Preferred Company from a “Special Preferred Enterprise” (as such term is defined in the\nInvestment Law) would be entitled, during a benefits period of 10 years, to further reduced tax rates of 8%, or 5% if the Special Preferred Enterprise is located in a certain\ndevelopment zone.\nDividends distributed from income which is attributed to a “Preferred Enterprise” will be subject to withholding tax at source at the following rates: (i) Israeli resident\ncorporations – 0%, (although, if such dividends are subsequently distributed to individuals or a non-Israeli company the below rates detailed in sub sections (ii) and (iii) shall apply),\n(ii) Israeli resident individuals – 20%, and (iii) non-Israeli residents (individuals and corporations)– 25% or 30%, and subject to a reduced tax rate under the provisions of any\napplicable double tax treaty (subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax Authority (“ITA”) allowing for such reduced tax rate – 20%).\nThe 2011 Amendment also provided transitional provisions to address companies already enjoying existing tax benefits under the Investment Law. These transitional provisions\nprovide, among other things, that unless an irrevocable request is made to apply the provisions of the Investment Law as amended in 2011 with respect to income to be derived as of\nJanuary 1, 2011, a Benefited Enterprise can elect to continue to benefit from the benefits provided to it before the 2011 Amendment came into effect, provided that certain conditions\nare met.\nWe do not currently intend to implement the 2011 Amendment.\nNew tax benefits under the 2017 Amendment that became effective on January 1, 2017. The 2017 Amendment was enacted as part of the Economic Efficiency Law that was\npublished on December 29, 2016, and is effective as of January 1, 2017. The 2017 Amendment provides new tax benefits for two types of “Technological Enterprises,” as described\nbelow, and is in addition to the other existing tax beneficial programs under the Investment Law.\nThe 2017 Amendment provides that a technological company satisfying certain conditions will qualify as a “Preferred Technological Enterprise” and will thereby enjoy a\nreduced corporate tax rate of 12% on income that qualifies as “Preferred Technological Income”, as defined in the Investment Law. The tax rate is further reduced to 7.5% for a\nPreferred Technological Enterprise located in development zone “A”. In addition, a Preferred Technological Company will enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 12% on capital gain\nderived from the sale of certain “Benefitted Intangible Assets” (as defined in the Investment Law) to a related foreign company if the Benefitted Intangible Assets were acquired from\na foreign company on or after January 1, 2017 for at least ILS 200 million, and the sale receives prior approval from the IIA.\n77\nThe 2017 Amendment further provides that a technology company satisfying certain conditions (group consolidated revenues of at least ILS 10 billion) will qualify as a\n“Special Preferred Technological Enterprise” and will thereby enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% on “Preferred Technological Income” regardless of the company’s geographic\nlocation within Israel. In addition, a Special Preferred Technological Enterprise will enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% on capital gain derived from the sale of certain\n“Benefitted Intangible Assets” to a related foreign company if the Benefitted Intangible Assets were either developed by the Special Preferred Technological Enterprise or acquired\nfrom a foreign company on or after January 1, 2017, and the sale received prior approval from the IIA. A Special Preferred Technological Enterprise that acquires Benefitted\nIntangible Assets from a foreign company for more than ILS 500 million will be eligible for these benefits for at least 10 years, subject to certain approvals as specified in the\nInvestment Law.\nDividends distributed to Israeli shareholders by a Preferred Technological Enterprise or a Special Preferred Technological Enterprise, paid out of Preferred Technological\nIncome, are generally subject to withholding tax at source at the rate of 20% (in the case of non-Israeli shareholders—subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the\nITA allowing for such reduced tax rate, or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty). However, if such dividends are paid to an Israeli company, no tax is\nrequired to be withheld (although, if such dividends are subsequently distributed to individuals or a non-Israeli company, withholding tax at a rate of 20% or such lower rate as may\nbe provided in an applicable tax treaty, will apply). If such dividends are distributed to a foreign company that holds solely or together with other foreign companies 90% or more in\nthe Israeli company and other conditions are met, the withholding tax rate will be 4% (in either case, subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the ITA allowing for\nsuch 4% rate or lower treaty tax rate).\nWe believe that we may be eligible to receive the tax benefits under the 2017 Amendment but there is no assurance that we will meet all the terms and conditions required\nunder the Investment Law that will allow us to enjoy any tax benefits under the Investment Law. It should be noted that the proportion of income that may be considered Preferred\nTechnological Income and enjoy the tax benefits described above should be calculated according to the Nexus Formula, which is based on the proportion as that of qualifying\nexpenditures in the intellectual property compared to overall expenditures.\nTaxation of Our Shareholders\nCapital gains taxes applicable to non-Israeli resident shareholders. A non-Israeli resident who derives capital gains from the sale of ordinary shares in an Israeli resident\ncompany that were purchased after the company was listed for trading on a stock exchange outside of Israel should be exempt from Israeli tax unless, among other requirements, the\nordinary shares were held through a permanent establishment that the non-resident maintains in Israel. If not exempt, a non-Israeli resident shareholder would generally be subject to\ntax on capital gain at the ordinary corporate income tax rate (23% in 2023), if generated by a company, or at the rate of 25%, if generated by an individual, or 30%, if generated by an\nindividual who is a “substantial shareholder” (as defined under the Ordinance), at the time of sale or at any time during the preceding 12-month period (or if the shareholder claims a\ndeduction for interest and linkage differences expenses in connection with the purchase and holding of such shares). A “substantial shareholder” is generally a person who, alone or\ntogether with such person’s relatives or another person who collaborates with such person on a permanent basis, holds, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of any of the “means of\ncontrol” of the corporation. “Means of control” generally include, among others, the right to vote, receive profits, nominate a director or an executive officer, receive assets upon\nliquidation, or order someone who holds any of the aforesaid rights how to act, regardless of the source of such right. Individual and corporate shareholders dealing in securities in\nIsrael are taxed at the tax rates applicable to business income (corporate income tax rate for a corporation (23% in 2023) and a marginal tax rate of up to 47% for an individual in\n2023 (excluding surtax as discussed below)) unless contrary provisions in a relevant tax treaty apply. Non-Israeli corporations will not be entitled to the foregoing exemption if Israeli\nresidents: (i) have a controlling interest of more than 25% in such non-Israeli corporation or (ii) are the beneficiaries of, or are entitled to, 25% or more of the revenues or profits of\nsuch non-Israeli corporation, whether directly or indirectly. In addition, such exemption is not applicable to a person whose gains from selling or otherwise disposing of the ordinary\nshares are deemed to be business income.\nAdditionally, a sale of ordinary shares by a non-Israeli resident may be exempt from Israeli capital gains tax under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty. For example, under\nThe Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the State of Israel with respect to Taxes on Income, as amended (the “United\nStates-Israel Tax Treaty”), the sale, exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares by a shareholder who is a United States resident (for purposes of the treaty) holding the ordinary\nshares as a capital asset and is entitled to claim the benefits afforded to such a resident by the United States-Israel Tax Treaty (a “Treaty U.S. Resident”) is generally exempt from\nIsraeli capital gains tax, unless: (i) the capital gain arising from such sale, exchange or disposition is attributed to real estate located in Israel; (ii) the capital gain arising from such\nsale, exchange or disposition is attributed to royalties; (iii) the capital gain arising from the such sale, exchange or disposition is attributed to a permanent establishment in Israel,\nunder certain terms; (iv) such Treaty U.S. Resident holds, directly or indirectly, shares representing 10% or more of the voting capital during any part of the 12-month period\npreceding the sale, exchange or disposition, subject to certain conditions; or (v) such Treaty U.S. Resident is an individual and was present in Israel for 183 days or more during the\nrelevant taxable year. In each case, the sale, exchange or disposition of our ordinary shares would be subject to Israeli tax, to the extent applicable; however, under the United States-\nIsrael Tax Treaty, the taxpayer may be permitted to claim a credit for such taxes against the U.S. federal income tax imposed with respect to such sale, exchange or disposition,\nsubject to the limitations under U.S. law applicable to foreign tax credits. The United States-Israel Tax Treaty does not provide such credit against any U.S. state or local taxes.\n78\nIn some instances where our shareholders may be liable for Israeli tax on the sale of their ordinary shares, the payment of the consideration may be subject to the withholding\nof Israeli tax at source. Shareholders may be required to demonstrate that they are exempt from tax on their capital gains in order to avoid withholding at source at the time of sale\n(i.e., valid withholding tax certificate issued by the ITA, resident certificate or other documentation).\nTaxation of non-Israeli shareholders on receipt of dividends. Non-Israeli residents (either individuals or corporations) are generally subject to Israeli income tax on the receipt\nof dividends paid on our ordinary shares at the rate of 25%, which tax will be withheld at source, unless relief is provided in a treaty between Israel and the shareholder’s country of\nresidence (subject to the receipt in advance of a valid withholding tax certificate from the ITA allowing for a reduced tax rate). With respect to a person who is a “substantial\nshareholder” at the time of receiving the dividend or on any time during the preceding 12 months, the applicable tax rate is 30%. Such dividends are generally subject to Israeli\nwithholding tax at a rate of 25% so long as the ordinary shares are registered with a nominee company (whether the recipient is a substantial shareholder or not) and, subject to the\nreceipt in advance of a valid withholding tax certificate from the ITA allowing for a reduced tax rate, 15% if the dividend is distributed from income attributed to an Approved\nEnterprise or a Benefited Enterprise and 20% if the dividend is distributed from income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise, a Special Preferred Enterprise, Preferred Technological\nEnterprise or Special Preferred Technological Enterprise or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty. For example, under the United States Israel Tax Treaty, the\nmaximum rate of tax withheld at source in Israel on dividends paid to a holder of our ordinary shares who is a Treaty U.S. Resident is 25%. However, generally, the maximum rate of\nwithholding tax on dividends, not generated by a Preferred Enterprise or Benefited Enterprise, that are paid to a U.S. corporation holding 10% or more of the outstanding voting\ncapital throughout the tax year in which the dividend is distributed as well as during the previous tax year, is 12.5%, provided that not more than 25% of the gross income for such\npreceding year consists of certain types of dividends and interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends distributed from income attributed to an Approved Enterprise, Benefited\nEnterprise or Preferred Enterprise are not entitled to such reduction under the tax treaty but are subject to a withholding tax rate of 15% for a shareholder that is a U.S. corporation,\nprovided that the conditions related to 10% or more holdings and to our gross income for the previous year (as set forth in the previous sentence) are met. The aforementioned rates\nunder the United States-Israel Tax Treaty would not apply if the dividend income is derived through a permanent establishment of the U.S. resident in Israel. If the dividend is\nattributable partly to income derived from an Approved Enterprise, Benefited Enterprise or Preferred Enterprise, and partly to other sources of income, the withholding rate will be a\nblended rate reflecting the relative portions of the two types of income. We cannot assure you that we will designate the profits that we may distribute in a way that will reduce\nshareholders’ tax liability.\nA non-Israeli resident who receives dividends from which all taxes due were withheld at source according to applicable provisions of the Ordinance and the regulations\npromulgated thereunder is generally exempt from the obligation to file tax returns in Israel with respect to such income, provided that (i) such income was not generated from\nbusiness conducted in Israel by the taxpayer, (ii) the taxpayer has no other taxable sources of income in Israel with respect to which a tax return is required to be filed, and (iii) the\ntaxpayer is not obligated to pay surtax (as further explained below).\nSurtax. Subject to the provisions of an applicable tax treaty, individuals who are subject to tax in Israel (whether any such individual is an Israeli resident or non-Israeli\nresident) are also subject to an additional tax at a rate of 3% on annual income (including, but not limited to, dividends, interest and capital gain) exceeding ILS 721,560 for 2024,\nwhich amount is linked to the annual change in the Israeli consumer price index.\nEstate and Gift Tax. Israeli law presently does not impose estate or gift taxes.\nUnited States Federal Income Taxation\nThe following is a description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares and warrants. This\ndescription addresses only the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders (as defined below) that hold our ordinary shares or warrants as capital assets within the meaning\nof Section 1221 of the Code, and that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. This discussion is based upon the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative\npronouncements and judicial decisions, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect). No ruling has been or will be\nrequested from the IRS regarding the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the ordinary shares and warrants, and there can be no assurance that the IRS\nwill agree with the discussion set out below. This summary does not address any U.S. tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences (e.g., the estate and gift tax,\nthe alternative minimum tax or the Medicare tax on net investment income) and does not address any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences.\n79\nThis description does not address tax considerations applicable to holders that may be subject to special tax rules, including, without limitation:\n• banks, financial institutions or insurance companies;\n• real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;\n• dealers or brokers;\n• traders that elect to mark to market;\n• tax exempt entities or organizations;\n• “individual retirement accounts” and other tax deferred accounts;\n• certain former citizens or long term residents of the United States;\n• persons that are resident or ordinarily resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States;\n• persons that acquired our ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of any employee share option or otherwise as compensation for the performance of services;\n• persons holding our ordinary shares or warrants as part of a “hedging,” “integrated” or “conversion” transaction or as a position in a “straddle” for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes;\n• partnerships or other pass through entities and persons holding ordinary shares or warrants through partnerships or other pass through entities; or\n• holders that own directly, indirectly or through attribution 10% or more of the total voting power or value of all of our outstanding shares.\nFor purposes of this description, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares or warrants that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is:\n• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;\n• a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state\nthereof, including the District of Columbia;\n• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or\n• a trust if such trust has validly elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if (1) a court within the United States is able to\nexercise primary supervision over its administration and (2) one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of such trust.\nIf a partnership (or any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our ordinary shares or warrants, the tax treatment of a\npartner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or partnership should consult its tax advisor as to the\nparticular U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of our ordinary shares or warrants in its particular circumstance.\nYou should consult your tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of our ordinary shares and\nwarrants.\n80\nDistributions on Ordinary Shares\nSubject to the discussion under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations” below, the gross amount of any distribution made to you with respect to our ordinary\nshares, before reduction for any Israeli taxes withheld therefrom, generally will be includible in your income as dividend income on the date on which the dividends are actually or\nconstructively received, to the extent such distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the\nextent that the amount of any distribution by us exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, it will be treated\nfirst as a tax free return of your adjusted tax basis in our ordinary shares and thereafter as capital gain. However, we do not expect to maintain calculations of our earnings and profits\nunder U.S. federal income tax principles and, therefore, you should expect that the entire amount of any distribution generally will be reported as dividend income to you. If you are a\nnon-corporate U.S. Holder you may qualify for the lower rates of taxation with respect to dividends on ordinary shares applicable to long term capital gains (i.e., gains from the sale\nof capital assets held for more than one year), provided that we are not a PFIC (as discussed below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations”) with respect to you\nin our taxable year in which the dividend was paid or in the prior taxable year and certain other conditions are met, including certain holding period requirements and the absence of\ncertain risk reduction transactions. However, such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporate U.S. Holders.\nDividends paid to you with respect to our ordinary shares generally will be treated as foreign source income, which may be relevant in calculating your foreign tax credit\nlimitation. Subject to certain conditions and limitations, Israeli tax withheld on dividends may be credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability or, at your election, be\ndeducted from your U.S. federal taxable income. An election to deduct creditable foreign taxes instead of claiming foreign tax credits would generally apply to all such foreign taxes\npaid or accrued in such taxable year. Dividends that we distribute generally should constitute “passive category income” for purposes of the foreign tax credit. A foreign tax credit for\nforeign taxes imposed on distributions may be denied if you do not satisfy certain minimum holding period requirements. Pursuant to applicable United States Treasury regulations,\nhowever, if a U.S. Holder is not eligible for the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty or does not elect to apply such treaty, then such holder may not be able to claim a foreign\ntax credit arising from any foreign tax imposed on a distribution on our ordinary shares, depending on the nature of such foreign tax. The rules relating to the determination of the\nforeign tax credit are complex, and you should consult your tax advisor to determine whether and to what extent you would be entitled to this credit, including your eligibility for\nbenefits under an applicable income tax treaty and the potential impact of the applicable United States Treasury regulations.\nSale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Ordinary Shares and Warrants\nSubject to the discussion under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations” below, you generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other\ndisposition of our ordinary shares or warrants equal to the difference between the amount realized on such sale, exchange or other disposition and your adjusted tax basis in our\nordinary shares or warrants, and such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. If you are a non-corporate U.S. Holder, capital gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of\nordinary shares or warrants is currently generally eligible for a preferential rate of taxation applicable to capital gains, if your holding period for such ordinary shares or warrants\nexceeds one year (i.e., such gain is long term capital gain). The deductibility of capital losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitations under the Code. Any such\ngain or loss that a U.S. Holder recognizes generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\nIn addition, pursuant to applicable United States Treasury regulations, if a U.S. Holder is not eligible for the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty or does not elect to\napply such treaty, then such holder may not be able to claim a foreign tax credit arising from any foreign tax imposed on the disposition of our ordinary shares, depending on the\nnature of such foreign tax. The rules governing the treatment of foreign taxes imposed on a U.S. Holder and foreign tax credits are complex and U.S. Holders should consult their tax\nadvisors as to whether the Israeli tax on gains may be creditable or deductible in light of their particular circumstances, including their eligibility for benefits under an applicable\nincome tax treaty and the potential impact of applicable United States Treasury regulations.\nExercise or Lapse of a Warrant\nExcept as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a warrant, a U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of an ordinary share\non the exercise of a warrant for cash. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares received upon exercise of warrants generally should be an amount equal to the sum of the U.S.\nHolder’s tax basis in the warrants exchanged therefor and the exercise price. The U.S. Holder’s holding period for ordinary shares received upon exercise of warrants will begin on\nthe date following the date of exercise (or possibly on the date of exercise) of the warrants and will not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the warrants. If a warrant\nis allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder’s tax basis in the warrant.\n81\nThe tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant are not clear under current U.S. federal income tax law. A cashless exercise may be tax-deferred, either because the\nexercise is not a realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In either tax-deferred situation, a U.S. Holder’s basis in\nthe ordinary shares received would equal the U.S. Holder’s basis in the warrants exercised therefore. If the cashless exercise is not treated as a realization event, a U.S. Holder’s\nholding period in the ordinary shares would be treated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise (or possibly on the date of exercise) of the warrants. If the cashless\nexercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of the ordinary shares would include the holding period of the warrants exercised therefore.\nIt is also possible that a cashless exercise of a warrant could be treated in part as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized in the manner set forth above\nunder “Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Ordinary Shares and Warrants.” In such event, a U.S. Holder could be deemed to have surrendered warrants equal to the number of\nordinary shares having an aggregate fair market value equal to the exercise price for the total number of warrants to be exercised. The U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or\nloss in an amount generally equal to the difference between (i) the fair market value of the warrants deemed surrendered and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such warrants deemed\nsurrendered. In this case, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares received would equal the sum of (i) U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the warrants deemed exercised and (ii) the\nexercise price of such warrants. A U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares received in such case generally would commence on the date following the date of exercise (or\npossibly on the date of exercise) of the warrants.\nDue to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise of warrants, there can be no assurance which, if any, of the alternative tax\nconsequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax\nconsequences of a cashless exercise of warrants.\nPossible constructive distributions\nThe terms of each warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of ordinary shares for which the warrant may be exercised or to the exercise price of the warrant in certain\nevents. An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. A U.S. Holder of a warrant would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive\ndistribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases the holder’s proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits (for instance, through an increase in the number\nof ordinary shares that would be obtained upon exercise of such warrant) as a result of a distribution of cash or other property such as other securities to the holders of the ordinary\nshares which is taxable to such holders under “Distributions on Ordinary Shares” above. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the\nsame manner as if the U.S. Holder of such warrant received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations\nIn general, a non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC for any taxable year if at least (i) 75% of its gross income is classified as “passive income” or (ii) 50% of its\ngross assets (generally determined on the basis of a quarterly average) produce or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income for this purpose generally includes\ndividends, interest, royalties, rents, gains from commodities and securities transactions and the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets which produce passive\nincome. For these purposes, cash and other assets readily convertible into cash are considered passive assets, and goodwill and other unbooked intangibles are generally taken into\naccount. In making this determination, the non-U.S. corporation is treated as earning its proportionate share of any income and owning its proportionate share of any assets of any\ncorporation in which it directly or indirectly holds 25% or more (by value) of the stock.\nWe believe we were a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31, 2023. However, as discussed below, whether we were a PFIC for any given taxable year is based on a\ncomplex and factual determination and there is no assurance that the IRS will agree with our determination. Based on the current and anticipated composition of our income, assets\nand operations, and those of our subsidiaries, we cannot be sure as to whether we will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our current taxable year or in future taxable\nyears. However, because PFIC status is based on our income, assets and activities for the entire taxable year, it is not possible to determine whether we will be characterized as a\nPFIC for our current taxable year or future taxable years until after the close of the applicable taxable year. Moreover, we must determine our PFIC status annually based on tests that\nare factual in nature, and our status in the current year and future years will depend on our income, assets and activities in each of those years and, as a result, cannot be predicted\nwith certainty as of the date hereof. The value of our assets (including unbooked goodwill) for purposes of the PFIC determination may be determined by reference to the trading\nvalue of our ordinary shares, which could fluctuate significantly.\n82\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our ordinary shares or warrants and, in the\ncase of our ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder did not make either a timely qualified electing fund (“QEF”) election or a mark-to-market election for our first taxable year as a PFIC in\nwhich the U.S. Holder held (or was deemed to hold) ordinary shares, as described below, such holder generally will be subject to special rules with respect to:\n• any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its ordinary shares or warrants; and\n• any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that are greater than 125%\nof the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect of the ordinary shares during the three preceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if\nshorter, such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares).\nUnder these rules,\n• the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares and warrants;\n• the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the period in the U.S.\nHolder’s holding period before the first day of our first taxable year in which we are a PFIC, will be taxed as ordinary income;\n• the amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for\nthat year and applicable to the U.S. Holder; and\n• the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed in respect of the tax attributable to each such other taxable year of the U.S. Holder.\nIn general, if we are determined to be a PFIC, a U.S. Holder may avoid the PFIC tax consequences described above with respect to our ordinary shares (but not our warrants)\nby making a timely QEF election (if eligible to do so) to include in income its pro rata share of our net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as\nordinary income), on a current basis, in each case whether or not distributed, in the taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which our taxable year ends.\nA U.S. Holder generally may make a separate election to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the QEF rules, but if deferred, any such taxes\nwill be subject to an interest charge. A U.S. Holder may not make a QEF election with respect to its warrants. As a result, if a U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of such warrants\n(other than upon exercise of such warrants), under currently proposed Treasury regulations, any gain recognized generally may be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules\ntreating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above, if we were a PFIC at any time during the period the U.S. Holder held the warrants. If a U.S. Holder that exercises such\nwarrants properly makes a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired ordinary shares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to our ordinary shares), the QEF\nelection will apply to the newly acquired ordinary shares, but the adverse tax consequences relating to PFIC shares, adjusted to take into account the current income inclusions\nresulting from the QEF election, will continue to apply with respect to such newly acquired ordinary shares (which generally will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes of\nthe PFIC rules that includes the period the U.S. Holder held the warrants), unless the U.S. Holder makes a purging election. One type of purging election creates a deemed sale of\nsuch shares at their fair market value. Any gain recognized in this deemed sale will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as\ndescribed above. As a result of this election, the U.S. Holder will have additional basis and, solely for purposes of the PFIC rules, a new holding period in the ordinary shares\nacquired upon the exercise of the warrants. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the application of the rules governing purging elections to their particular\ncircumstances (including a potential separate “deemed dividend” purging election that may be available if we are a “controlled foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes).\nThe QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and, once made, can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder generally makes a QEF\nelection by attaching a completed IRS Form 8621 (Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund), including the\ninformation provided in a PFIC Annual Information Statement, to a timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for the tax year to which the election relates. Retroactive QEF\nelections generally may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return and if certain other conditions are met or with the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should\nconsult their tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a retroactive QEF election under their particular circumstances.\n83\nIn order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive a PFIC Annual Information Statement from us. If we determine we were a PFIC for a\ngiven taxable year, we will reasonably endeavor to provide a PFIC Annual Information Statement to a U.S. Holder upon request. There can be no assurance, however, that we will\ntimely provide such information for the current taxable year or subsequent taxable years. The failure to provide such information on an annual basis could prevent a U.S. Holder from\nmaking a QEF election or result in the invalidation or termination of a U.S. Holder’s prior QEF election.\nIf a U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to our ordinary shares, and the special tax and interest charge rules do not apply to such shares (because of a timely QEF\nelection for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) such shares or a purge of the PFIC taint pursuant to a purging election, as described\nabove), any gain recognized on the sale of our ordinary shares generally will be taxable as capital gain and no interest charge will be imposed under the PFIC rules. As discussed\nabove, U.S. Holders of a QEF are currently taxed on their pro rata shares of its earnings and profits, whether or not distributed. In such case, a subsequent distribution of such\nearnings and profits that were previously included in income generally should not be taxable as a dividend to such U.S. Holders. The tax basis of a U.S. Holder’s shares in a QEF will\nbe increased by amounts that are included in income, and decreased by amounts distributed but not taxed as dividends, under the above rules.\nAlthough a determination as to our PFIC status will be made annually, an initial determination that our company is a PFIC will generally apply for subsequent years to a U.S.\nHolder who held ordinary shares or warrants while we were a PFIC, whether or not we meet the test for PFIC status in those subsequent years. A U.S. Holder who makes the QEF\nelection discussed above for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) ordinary shares, however, will not be subject to the PFIC tax and\ninterest charge rules discussed above in respect to such shares. In addition, such U.S. Holder will not be subject to the QEF inclusion regime with respect to such ordinary shares for\nany taxable year of us that ends within or with a taxable year of the U.S. Holder and in which we are not a PFIC. On the other hand, if the QEF election is not effective for each of our\ntaxable years in which we are a PFIC and the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) ordinary shares, the PFIC rules discussed above will continue to apply to such ordinary shares\nunless the U.S. Holder makes a purging election, as described above, and pays the tax and interest charge with respect to the gain inherent in such shares attributable to the pre-QEF\nelection period.\nAlternatively, if a U.S. Holder, at the close of its taxable year, owns shares in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock, the U.S. Holder may make a mark-to-market election\nwith respect to such shares for such taxable year. If the U.S. Holder makes a valid mark-to-market election for the first taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which the U.S. Holder holds\n(or is deemed to hold) ordinary shares and for which we are determined to be a PFIC, such U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above in respect to\nits ordinary shares. Instead, in general, the U.S. Holder will include as ordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its ordinary shares at the end of its\ntaxable year over the adjusted basis in its ordinary shares. Such a U.S. Holder also will be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted basis of its\nordinary shares over the fair market value of its ordinary shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the\nmark-to-market election). Such U.S. Holder’s basis in its ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and any further gain recognized on a sale or\nother taxable disposition of the ordinary shares will be treated as ordinary income. Currently, a mark-to-market election may not be made with respect to our warrants.\nThe mark-to-market election is available only for stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the SEC, including Nasdaq, or on a\nforeign exchange or market that the IRS determines, has rules sufficient to ensure that the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. U.S. Holders should\nconsult their tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a mark-to-market election in respect to our ordinary shares under their particular circumstances.\nCertain of the PFIC rules may impact U.S. Holders with respect to equity interests in subsidiaries and other entities which we may hold, directly or indirectly, that are PFICs\n(collectively, “Lower-Tier PFICs”). There can be no assurance, however, that we do not own, or will not in the future acquire, an interest in a subsidiary or other entity that is or\nwould be treated as a Lower-Tier PFIC. If we own any interests in a Lower-Tier PFIC, a U.S. Holder generally must make a separate QEF election for each Lower-Tier PFIC, subject\nto our providing the relevant tax information for each Lower-Tier PFIC on an annual basis. A mark-to-market election generally would not be available with respect to any Lower-\nTier PFIC. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to any of our subsidiaries.\n84\nA U.S. Holder of a PFIC may be required to file an IRS Form 8621 on an annual basis in certain circumstances which include, but are not limited to, if a U.S. Holder\nrecognizes gain on a disposition of such ordinary shares or receives distributions with respect to such ordinary shares. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any\nreporting requirements that may apply to them if we are a PFIC.\nThe rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF and mark-to-market elections are very complex, are unclear in certain respects, and are affected by various factors in addition to\nthose described above. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of ordinary shares or warrants should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of the PFIC rules to our ordinary shares\nor warrants under their particular circumstances.\nBackup Withholding Tax and Certain Information Reporting Requirements\nDistribution payments on, and proceeds paid from the sale or other taxable disposition of, the ordinary shares and warrants may be subject to information reporting to the IRS.\nIn addition, a U.S. Holder may be subject to backup withholding on payments received in connection with distribution payments and proceeds from the sale or other taxable\ndisposition of ordinary shares or warrants made within the United States or through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries.\nBackup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number, provides other required certification and otherwise\ncomplies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules or that is otherwise exempt from backup withholding (and, when required, demonstrates such exemption).\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules will be creditable or refundable against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nForeign Asset Reporting\nCertain U.S. Holders are required to report their holdings of certain foreign financial assets, including equity of foreign entities, if the aggregate value of all of these assets\nexceeds certain threshold amounts, by filing IRS Form 8938 with their federal income tax return. Our ordinary shares and warrants are expected to constitute foreign financial assets\nsubject to these requirements unless the ordinary shares or warrants are held in an account at certain financial institutions. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors\nregarding their information reporting obligations, if any, with respect to their ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares and warrants and the significant penalties for non-\ncompliance.\nThe above description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares and\nwarrants. You should consult your tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of your particular situation.\nF. Dividends and Paying Agents\nNot applicable.\nG. Statement by Experts\nNot applicable.\nH. Documents on Display\nWe are subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we are required to file reports and other information with the SEC, including annual reports\non Form 20-F and reports on Form 6-K.\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are exempt under the Exchange Act from, among other things, the rules prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our\nofficers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we\nare not required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered\nunder the Exchange Act. We are required to make certain filings with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet website that contains reports, proxy statements and other information\nabout issuers, like us, that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is www.sec.gov.\nOur ordinary shares and warrants are quoted on Nasdaq. Information about us is also available on our website at https://innoviz.tech/. Our website and the information\ncontained therein or connected thereto will not be deemed to be incorporated into this Annual Report and you should not rely on any such information in making your decision\nwhether to purchase our ordinary shares or warrants.\n85\nI. Subsidiary Information\nNot applicable.\nJ. Annual Report to Security Holders\nNot applicable.\nItem 11.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in\nfinancial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which are discussed in detail below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our cash equivalents consisted of interest-bearing short-term deposits and marketable securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is\ninterest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of interest of the Bank of Israel, and U.S. Federal Reserve interest rates. Due to the short-term nature\nand the low-risk profile of our interest-bearing accounts, an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term restricted bank deposits or on our financial position or results of operations. We are currently exposed to significant market risk related to changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates; as we pay most of our salaries in ILS and we contract with vendors located in the UK, Europe and Israel. Our operations may be subject to\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future.\nWe do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur financial results are reported in USD, and changes in the exchange rate between USD and local currencies in the countries in which we operate (primarily the ILS) may\naffect the results of our operations. In the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 98% of our revenues were denominated in USD. The USD cost of our operations in\ncountries other than the United States, may be negatively influenced by revaluation of the USD against other currencies.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the value of the USD appreciated against the value of the ILS by approximately 3.1%. Our most significant foreign currency\nexposures are related to our operations in Israel. The company hedges its anticipated exposure by exchanging USD into ILS in amounts sufficient to fund up to three months of\noperations and monitoring foreign currency exchange rates over time.\nItem 12.Description of Securities Other than Equity Securities\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 13.Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies\nNone.\nItem 14.Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\n86\nItem 15. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and\nforms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the\ndesired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and\noperation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as\nof December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nExchange Act. Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in “Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm as we are an emerging growth company and are exempt from the requirement\nto provide such a report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act) that\noccurred during the period covered by this Annual Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 16A.Audit Committee Financial Expert\nOur board of directors has determined that Mr. Dan Falk, chairman of our audit committee, satisfies the “independence” requirements set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the\nExchange Act.

The board of directors subsequently accepted the recommendation of the audit committee and approved the engagement of PwC as\nour independent public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, contingent and effective upon the approval of such engagement by our shareholders. In\nDecember 2023, our shareholders approved the engagement of PwC.\nWe engaged PwC as our new independent registered public accounting firm as of November 7, 2023. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the\nsubsequent interim period through November 7, 2023, we have not consulted with PwC regarding any of the matters described in Item 16F(a)(2)(i) or Item 16F(a)(2)(ii) of Form 20-\nF.\nAs disclosed in our Report on Form 6-K, filed with the SEC on November 7, 2023, the reports of EY on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. In\nconnection with the audits of our financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and during the subsequent interim period\nthrough the date of this Annual Report, there were no disagreements with EY on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope\nand procedures which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of EY, would have caused EY to make reference to the matter in their reports on our financial statements, and there were no\nreportable events as the term is described in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F.\nPrior to the filing of the Form 6-K on November 7, 2023, we delivered a copy of the disclosure in the Form 6-K to EY and requested that a letter addressed to the SEC stating\nwhether or not it agrees with the statements made in response to this disclosure and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. EY responded with a letter dated November\n7, 2023, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99.3 to such Form 6-K, stating that EY agrees with the statements set forth therein.\nItem 16G.Corporate Governance\nWe are a “foreign private issuer” (as such term is defined in Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act) and our ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq. We believe the following to be the\nsignificant differences between our corporate governance practices and those applicable to U.S. companies under the Nasdaq listing standards. Under the Nasdaq rules, listed\ncompanies that are foreign private issuers are permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the corporate governance provisions specified by the Nasdaq with limited\nexceptions. We rely on this “home country practice exemption” with respect to the quorum requirement for shareholder meetings. As permitted under the Companies Law, pursuant to\nour Articles, the quorum required for an ordinary meeting of shareholders consists of at least two shareholders present in person, by proxy or by other voting instrument in accordance\nwith the Companies Law, who hold at least 25% of the voting power of our shares (and in an adjourned meeting, with some exceptions, any number of shareholders), instead of 33\n1/3% of the issued share capital required under the Nasdaq corporate governance rules.\nWe otherwise comply with and intend to continue to comply with the rules generally applicable to U.S. domestic companies listed on the Nasdaq. We may in the future,\nhowever, decide to use other foreign private issuer exemptions with respect to some or all the other Nasdaq listing rules. Following our home country governance practices may\nprovide less protection than is accorded to investors under the Nasdaq listing rules applicable to domestic issuers.\nItem 16H.Mine Safety Disclosure\nNot applicable.\nItem 16I. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNot applicable.\nItem 16J.Insider Trading Policies\nNot applicable.\nItem 16K.Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and\ninformation from third party entities. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan.\nWe design and assess our program based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or\nrequirements, only that we use the NIST CSF as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and\ngovernance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.\n89\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes:\n• Suppliers risk assessments and scan designed to identify cybersecurity risks from third parties to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader\nenterprise or IT environment prior to engagement;\n• an in-house security team principally responsible for managing (i) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (ii) our security controls, and (iii) our response to\ncybersecurity incidents from external entities;\n• the use and risks of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist to minimize and mitigate the risk with aspects of our security\ncontrols from external entities;\n• cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, related to risks from external contractors or entities, incident response personnel, and senior management to\nintervene in case needed;\n• a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents from external entities; and\n• a third-party risk management process for service providers, suppliers, and vendors.\nWe have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur board of directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and oversights cybersecurity and other information technology risks. Our board of\ndirectors oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.\nThe board of directors receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the board of directors, as necessary, and the\naudit committee, where applicable, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential.\nMembers of our board of directors receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from Chief Operation Officer, on a quarterly basis, as part of its continuing education on topics\nthat impact public companies.\nOur management team, including our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and director of IT, are responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from\ncybersecurity threats. The team has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our\nretained external cybersecurity consultants. Our management team’s experience includes governance and risk compliance (GRC) and enterprise security operations management.\nOur management team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from\ninternal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts\nand reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.\nPART III\nItem 17.Financial Statements\nWe have provided financial statements pursuant to Item 18.\nItem 18.Financial Statements\nThe audited consolidated financial statements as required under Item 18 are attached hereto starting on page F-1 of this Annual Report.

Innoviz Technologies Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the “Company” or “Innoviz”) is a Tier-1 direct supplier of high-performance, automotive grade LiDAR sensors and\nperception solutions that feature technological breakthroughs across core components and bring enhanced vision and superior performance to enable safe\nautonomous driving at a mass scale. The Company provides a complete and comprehensive solution for OEMs and Tier-1 partners that are developing and\nmarketing autonomous driving vehicles to passenger cars and other relevant markets, such as robotaxis, shuttles, delivery vehicles and trucks. The Company\noperates as a single operating segment.\nb. The Company was incorporated on January 18, 2016, under the laws of the state of Israel.\nc. On December 10, 2020, the Company entered into definitive agreements in connection with a merger (the “Transactions”) with Collective Growth Corporation\n(“Collective Growth”), a special purpose acquisition company, that resulted in Collective Growth becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company upon the\nconsummation of the Transactions on April 5, 2021 (the “Closing Date”).\nThe Transactions were accounted for as a recapitalization in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).\nUpon closing of the Transactions, 20,418,209 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares, 15,906,053 Series B Convertible Preferred Shares, 3,032,940 Series B-1\nConvertible Preferred Shares, 28,216,005 Series C Convertible Preferred Shares and 3,045,792 Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Shares were automatically\nconverted into 70,618,999 Ordinary Shares of no-par value.\nIn connection with the Transactions (i) 1,875,000 shares of Class B common shares of Collective Growth, after taking into account the forfeiture of shares by the\nholders of Class B common shares of Collective Growth, were each exchanged for one ordinary share of no-par value of the Company (“Company Ordinary\nShare”), (ii) each outstanding share of Class A common shares of Collective Growth was exchanged for one Company Ordinary Share, and (iii) each outstanding\nwarrant of Collective Growth was assumed by the Company and became one warrant of the Company (each, a “Company Warrant”) exercisable for Company\nOrdinary Shares (see Note 2a).\nIn connection with the Transactions, the Company incurred direct and incremental costs of $102,945 related to the Transactions, consisting primarily of investment\nbanking, legal, accounting and other professional fees, out of which $101,115 were recorded to additional paid-in capital as a reduction of proceeds and $1,830 have\nbeen accounted for as General and Administrative expenses as part of the consolidated statement of operations.\nIn addition, on the Closing Date, in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (i) the Company issued Perception Capital Partners LLC (“Perception”)\nan aggregate of 3,027,747 Company Warrants, (ii) the Company issued Antara Capital Master Fund LP (“Antara”) an aggregate of 3,002,674 Company Ordinary\nShares and 3,784,753 Company Warrants and (iii) the Company issued Company’s Management 2,500,000 Ordinary Shares and 3,500,000 options (see also Note\n12).\nIn addition, in the event that the earnout Target is reached during the Earnout Period (both “Target” and “Earnout Period” as defined in the Business Combination\nAgreement), then: (A) Perception shall also be entitled to receive up to 2,089,882 of additional Company Ordinary Shares, (B) Antara shall also be entitled to\nreceive up to 312,296 of additional Company Ordinary Shares and (C) certain members of the Company’s management shall be entitled to receive up to 1,250,000\nof additional Company Ordinary Shares. As of December 31, 2023, the Target was not reached and therefore no additional Company Ordinary Shares have been\nissued (see also Note 12).\nF - 10\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)\nNOTE 1: - GENERAL (Cont.)\nAdditionally, on the Closing Date, the Company completed the sale of Ordinary Shares to certain accredited investors (“Investors”), at a price per share of $10, for\ngross proceeds to the Company of $229,500, pursuant to a series of subscription agreements (“Subscription Agreements” or “PIPE”) entered into by the Company\nand the Investors concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement.\nUpon closing of the Transactions, the Company has adopted, amended and restated articles of association to align such organizational documents with consistent\nwith those of a publicly held company and has become a publicly traded company.\nThe Company’s ordinary shares and public warrants were listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the trading symbols “INVZ” and “INVZW”, respectively,\non April 5, 2021.\nd. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s principal source of liquidity includes its cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $26,283, bank deposits in the amount\nof $105,750 and marketable securities in the amount of $18,148, which is sufficient to finance its business plan for at least 12 months from the date these financial\nstatements are issued. As the Company achieves further commercial success, it may need to obtain additional funding to support its continuing operations. If the\nCompany is unable to raise capital when and if needed, it may need to reduce or eliminate some of its research and development programs.\ne. In October 2023, Israel was attacked by a terrorist organization and entered a state of war. As of the date of these consolidated financial statements, the war in Israel\nis ongoing and continues to evolve. The intensity and duration of the war is difficult to predict, as such are the war’s economic implications on the Company’s\noperational and financial performance. The Company considered the impact of the war and determined that there were no material adverse impacts on the\nconsolidated financial statements, including related significant estimates made by management, for the period ended December 31, 2023.\nF - 11\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\na. Transactions:\nThe Transactions were accounted for as a recapitalization as pre-combination Innoviz was determined to be the accounting acquirer under Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB)’s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). In connection with the recapitalization, outstanding\nshare capital of the pre-combination Innoviz was converted into Company Ordinary Shares, representing a recapitalization, and the net assets of the Company\nremained at historical cost, with no goodwill or intangible assets recorded.\nThe pre-combination Innoviz was deemed to be the predecessor of the Company, and the consolidated assets and liabilities and results of operations prior to the\nClosing Date are those of the pre-combination Innoviz.\nOrdinary Share Warrants\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrants’ specific terms and\napplicable authoritative guidance. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments, meet the definition of a liability under\nASC 480, are indexed to the Company’s own share and whether the warrants are eligible for equity classification under ASC 815-40. This assessment is conducted\nat the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent reporting period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\nWarrants that meet all the criteria for equity classification are recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital. Warrants that do not meet all the criteria for\nequity classification, are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured to fair value through earnings at each\nbalance sheet date thereafter.\nUpon the closing of the Transactions, 7,499,991 public warrants and 1,918,750 private warrants, that were both issued by Collective Growth prior to the\nTransactions, were assumed by the Company and became Company Warrants outstanding to purchase Company Ordinary Shares.\nEach warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Company Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustments. The warrants are exercisable at\nany time commencing 30 days after the completion of the Transactions and expire five years after the Closing Date or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The\nCompany may redeem the outstanding warrants in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per warrant at any time after they become exercisable, provided that the\nlast sale price of the Company Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $18 per share, subject to adjustments, for any 20-trading days within a 30-trading day period\nending three business days prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. The private warrants have similar terms\nas the public warrants, except that the private warrants may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis at the holder’s option and the private warrants will not be\nredeemed by the Company as long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, but once they are transferred, they have the same rights\nas the public warrants.\nF - 12\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nAs the private warrants include provisions that provide for potential changes to the settlement amounts that are dependent on the characteristics of the holder of the\nwarrant, under ASC 815-40, those warrants are not indexed to the Company’s ordinary shares in the manner contemplated by that Section, so long as they are held\nby the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Therefore, the private warrants were classified as a liability, initially and subsequently measured at fair value\nthrough earnings.\nConversely, since the public warrants are indexed to the Company’s own share, they qualify for equity classification under ASC Section 815-40.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 1,465,000 private warrants are no longer held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. As a result, such private warrants\nhave the same terms as the public warrants and were classified to equity. As of December 31, 2023, 453,750 private warrants remain outstanding.\nb. Use of estimates:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nSignificant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include inventory reserves and useful lives of property, plant, and equipment. The Company bases\nthese estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including\nassumptions as to future events. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nc. Financial statements in U.S. dollars:\nA substantial portion of the Company’s financing activities, including equity transactions and cash investments, are incurred in U.S. dollars. The Company’s\nmanagement believes that the U.S. dollar is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. Thus, the functional and reporting\ncurrency of the Company is the U.S. dollar.\nA subsidiary’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates; normally, that is the currency of the\nenvironment in which a subsidiary primarily generates and expends cash. In making the determination of the appropriate functional currency for a subsidiary, the\nCompany considers cash flow indicators, local market indicators, financing indicators and the subsidiary’s relationship with both the parent company and other\nsubsidiaries. For subsidiaries that are primarily a direct and integral component or extension of the parent entity’s operations, the U.S. dollar is the functional\ncurrency.\nF - 13\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nThe Company has determined the functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar. The foreign operations are considered a direct and integral part\nor extension of the Company’s operations. The day-to-day operations of the foreign subsidiary are dependent on the economic environment of the U.S. Dollar.\nAccordingly, monetary accounts maintained in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of the\nAccounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) No. 830 “Foreign Currency Matters” (“ASC No. 830”). All transaction gains and losses of the remeasured monetary\nbalance sheet items are reflected in the statements of operations as financial income or expenses as appropriate.\nd. Principles of consolidation:\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been\neliminated upon consolidation.\ne. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted deposits:\nThe Company considers all highly liquid short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less from the investment date to be cash equivalents. Cash\nequivalents consist primarily of amounts invested in short term deposits. Restricted cash and restricted deposits consist deposits that serve as collateral mainly for\nlease agreements at the Company’s financial institutions.\nf. Inventory:\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.\nCost of inventory is determined as follows:\nRaw materials and work in process - based on weighted average cost.\nFinished goods - based mainly on weighted average standard cost method.\nThe Company charges cost of revenues for write-downs of inventory which are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand based on a consideration of\nmarketability and product life cycle stage, product development plans, component cost trends, manufacturing yields, demand forecasts, historical revenue and\nassumptions about future demand and market conditions.\nLosses expected to arise from firm non-cancelable commitments for future purchases of inventory are charged to cost of revenues unless the losses are recoverable\nthrough firm sales contracts or other means.\nF - 14\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\ng. Property and equipment, net:\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are determined\nwhen those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. When useful life is reassessed for an asset, the\nremaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated over the revised estimated useful life. Depreciation is calculated on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, at the following annual rates:\n%\nComputers and software 33\nOffice furniture and equipment 20\nMachinery and lab equipment 12.5-25\nLeasehold improvements Over the shorter of the related lease period or the useful life of the assets\nh. Impairment of long-lived assets:\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment” (“ASC 360”), whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the aggregate\nundiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the\nassets exceeds their fair value. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded impairment losses in the amount of $1,997,\n$362 and $599, respectively.\ni. Revenue recognition:\nAccording to Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all the related amendments (“ASC 606”), a performance\nobligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. Goods and services that are not distinct are bundled with other\ngoods or services in the contract until a bundle of goods or services that is distinct is created. A good or service promised to a customer is distinct if the customer\ncan benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the entity’s promise to transfer\nthe good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nThe Company derives its revenues mainly from sales of LiDAR sensors, critical components and application engineering services for its customers. As such, the\nCompany contracts with its customers, may contain the following main performance obligations: (i) sales of LiDAR sensors; (ii) sales of critical components; (iii)\napplication engineering services. The Company evaluates each performance obligation to determine if it is satisfied at a point in time or over time.\nF - 15\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nRevenue from LiDAR sensors and critical components is recognized at a point in time when the control of the goods is transferred to the customer, generally upon\ndelivery.\nApplication engineering services to certain customers may require substantive customer acceptance due to performance acceptance criteria that is considered more\nthan a formality. For these services, revenue is recognized at a point in time upon customer acceptance. During the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company\nrecognized revenue at a point in time of $15,225 for application engineering services, after receiving customer acceptance. The Company did not recognize revenue\nrelated to application engineering services during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. See additional details for upfront payments for application\nengineering services below.\nThe Company capitalizes costs of fulfilling application engineering services contracts, to the extent recoverable, that relate directly to contracts for which revenue\nrecognition has yet to commence. These assets are amortized to cost of revenues consistently with the pattern of the revenue recognition of application engineering\nservices.\nThe Company applies the practical expedient and does not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is\nsuch that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer will be one year or less.\nFor each contract which includes prepayment terms, the Company evaluates whether the contract includes a significant financing component. The Company’s\ncontracts with customer prepayment terms do not include a significant financing component because the primary purpose is not to receive financing from the\ncustomers.\nThe Company’s general terms and conditions for its contracts do not contain a right of return that allows the customer to return products and receive a credit.\nDeferred Revenues\nDeferred revenues in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, which represent contract liabilities, include mainly billings in excess of revenues recognized\nrelated to product sales and obligations under application engineering service agreements with OEMs and are recognized as revenues when the Company performs\nits obligations under the contract.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company received upfront payments in total of $6,145 from customers which are expected to be recognized as revenue once the\nrelated application engineering services projects are completed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $3,096 that was included in deferred revenues balance at December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $136 that was included in deferred revenues balance at December 31, 2021.\nF - 16\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

As of December 31, 2023, the\naggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $7,339 (out of which, $6,145 is recorded as short-term deferred\nrevenues), which the Company expects to recognize as revenues.\nj. Cost of revenues:\nCost of revenues include the manufacturing cost of LiDAR sensors, which primarily consists of components costs, sub-assembly costs and personnel-related costs,\nand amounts paid to third-party contract manufacturers and vendors. Cost of revenues also includes depreciation, costs of providing application engineering\nservices (mainly personnel related costs), an allocated portion of overhead, warranty costs, excess and obsolete inventory and shipping costs.\nk. Warranty provision:\nThe Company provides standard product warranties, for its pre-SOP products, for period of up to twelve months, at no extra charge, that covers the compliance of\nthe products with agreed-upon specifications. Standard warranties are considered to be assurance type warranties and are not accounted for as separate performance\nobligations. A provision is recorded for estimated warranty costs based on the Company’s experience.\nChanges in the warranty provision, presented in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, was as follow:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nBalance at the beginning of the year $ 330 $ 60\nWarranty provision 361 620\nWarranty claims settled (106) (350)\nBalance at the end of the year $ 585 $ 330\nl. Research and development expenses:\nResearch and development costs include mainly personnel-related expenses associated with the Company’s engineering personnel responsible for the design,\ndevelopment and testing of its products. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the technological\nfeasibility is reached, which for the Company’s software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production.

Patent costs:\nLegal and related patent costs are charged to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred, since their realization is\nuncertain.\nn. Leases\nThe Company applies ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” Topic 842 (“ASC 842”) for its leases. The Company elected to not recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use\n(“ROU”) asset for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease payments on short-term leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term, not included in lease liabilities. Lastly, the Company also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for its leases.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease and the classification of that lease at inception based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a\ndistinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period, and\n(3) whether the Company has a right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of use.\nROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make minimum lease payments arising\nfrom the lease.\nLeases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: the lease\ntransfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease\nterm is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset, the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the\nasset, or the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of lease term. A lease is classified as\nan operating lease if it does not meet any one of these criteria. Since all of the Company’s lease contracts do not meet any of the criteria above, the Company\nconcluded that all of its lease contracts should be classified as operation leases.\nROU assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose,\nthe Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit\nrate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available on the commencement date in determining the present value of lease\npayments. All ROU assets are reviewed for impairment. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the\nCompany will exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination option.\nFor further information on the Company’s leasing activities see Note 6.\nF - 18\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\no. Share-based compensation:\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC No. 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“ASC No. 718”). ASC No. 718\nrequires companies to estimate the fair value of equity-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the award is\nrecognized as an expense over the requisite service period.\nThe Company selected the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate model for determining the fair value for its share options awards, whereas\nthe fair value of restricted share units is based on the closing market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant. The option pricing model requires several\nassumptions, of which the most significant are the expected share price volatility and the expected option term. The Company recognizes forfeitures of equity-\nbased awards as they occur. For graded vesting awards subject to a service condition only, the Company recognizes compensation expenses based on the straight-\nline method over the requisite service period.\nA Monte-Carlo simulation model was used to determine the grant date fair value of the Company’s Management earn-out shares by simulating the future share\nprice daily up to the expiration date of the award. For each simulation path we determined the value of the award. The grant date fair value of this award is the\naverage of the values determined by each simulation. The simulation was also used to derive the requisite service period (see Note 12d).\np. Accrued post-employment benefit:\nSeverance pay\nThe Israeli Severance Pay Law, 1963 (“Severance Pay Law”), specifies that employees are entitled to severance payment, following the termination of their\nemployment. Under the Severance Pay Law, the severance payment is calculated as one-month salary for each year of employment, or a portion thereof.\nThe Company’s liability for all of its Israeli employees is covered by the provisions of Section 14 of the Severance Pay Law (“Section 14”). Under Section 14\nemployees are entitled to monthly deposits, at a rate of 8.33% of their monthly salary, continued on their behalf to their insurance funds. Payments in accordance\nwith Section 14 release the Company from any future severance payments in respect of those employees. As a result, the Company does not recognize any liability\nfor severance pay due to these employees and the deposits under Section 14 are not recorded as an asset in the Company’s balance sheet.\nSeverance pay expenses under Section 14 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, amounted to $3,723, $3,586 and $2,891, respectively.\nF - 19\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

Income taxes:\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC No. 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”). ASC 740 prescribes the use of the liability method\nwhereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a\nvaluation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value, if it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax\nassets will not be realized.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. Accounting guidance addresses the determination of whether tax\nbenefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements, under which a Company may recognize the\ntax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on\nthe technical merits of the position.\nr. Concentration of credit risk:\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables,\nmarketable securities, bank deposits and restricted deposits.\nThe majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits are invested with major banks in Israel. The Company believes that the\nfinancial institutions that hold the Company’s cash deposits are financially sound and, accordingly, bear minimal risk.\nTrade receivables of the Company are mainly derived from customers located globally. The Company mitigates its credit risks by performing credit evaluations of\nits customers’ financial conditions and requires customer advance payments in certain circumstances. The Company generally does not require collateral.\nThe Company invests in marketable securities with an average credit rating of “A” and a maturity of up to three years. The Company’s investment policy is not to\ninvest more than 5% of its investment portfolio in a single security at time of purchase.\ns. Trade receivables, net:\nTrade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Trade receivables are periodically assessed for allowance for doubtful accounts,\nwhich is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of credit losses inherent in its existing accounts receivable. In establishing the required allowance,\nmanagement considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and customers’ financial condition, the amount of receivables in\ndispute, the current receivables aging, in addition to current and expected payment patterns. The allowance of doubtful accounts was not material for the periods\npresented.\nF - 20\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nt. Investment in marketable securities:\nThe Company’s investment in marketable securities consists of corporate and government debentures with quoted OTC market prices. All the Company's\nmarketable securities are stated at fair value as determined by the closing price of each security at balance sheet date. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities\nare included in financial income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nu. Fair value of financial instruments:\nThe Company applies ASC No. 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC No. 820”), with respect to fair value measurements of all financial assets\nand liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value.\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an\nasset or a liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in\nmeasuring fair value:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible on the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset\nor liability.\nLevel 3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or\nno market activity).\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and restricted deposits, trade receivables, other current assets, trade payables, employees and payroll\naccruals and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\nThe estimated fair value of private warrants has been determined by the Company using available market information and valuation methodologies (see also Note\n7). Considerable judgment is required in estimating fair values. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a\ncurrent market exchange.\nF - 21\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands (except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nv. Loss per share:\nThe Company computes basic loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share”, by dividing the net loss attributable to ordinary\nshareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted loss per share is computed by considering the potential\ndilution that could occur upon the exercise of awards granted under share-based compensation plans and equity-classified instruments using the treasury stock\nmethod. Impact of liability-classified instruments on diluted loss per share is considered using the if-converted method. Diluted loss per share excludes all dilutive\npotential ordinary shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nPrior to the Transactions, the Company computed net loss per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires\nincome available to common shareholders for the period to be allocated between common shares and participating securities based upon their respective rights to\nreceive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company considered its preferred shares to be participating securities as the holders of\nthe preferred shares were entitled to dividends that would have been distributed to the holders of common shares, on a pro-rata basis assuming conversion of all\npreferred shares into common shares. These participating securities did not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the Company’s losses.\nAs such, net loss for the periods presented was not allocated to the Company’s participating securities.\nw. Other comprehensive loss:\nThe Company has no components of comprehensive loss other than net loss. Thus, comprehensive loss is the same as net loss for the periods presented.\nx. Recently adopted accounting pronouncement:\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 (Topic 326), Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments, which has replaced the previous incurred loss impairment methodology. Under the new guidance an entity is required to recognize an allowance that\nreflects its current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument based on historical experience, current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\ny. Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted:\nAs an “emerging growth company,” the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) allows the Company to delay adoption of new or revised accounting\npronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. The Company has elected to use this\nextended transition period under the JOBS Act. The adoption dates discussed below reflects this election.\n1. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which updates\nreportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is\npermitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently\nevaluating the effect that ASU 2023-07 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n2. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes\npaid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The\nASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025, and allows adoption on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option. The\nCompany is in the process of assessing the impacts and method of adoption.

This lease agreement includes a right to use office spaces\nand related facilities. The lease term is for 67 months, starting from July 1, 2022. However, the Company was given access to the Premises starting from November\n2021 in order to allow it to construct leasehold improvements. The Company has an option to renew the lease for additional 60 months, which will be exercised\nautomatically unless the Company informs the lessor in advance. The Company currently estimates it is reasonably certain that it will exercise this option. The lease\npayments for the Premises are based on an estimation of the Premises' size in square meters taken prior to construction and may be updated according to the agreement\nof the parties on the measurement of the Premises taken after construction. Payments are adjusted periodically to the Israeli consumer price index (CPI). The ROU asset\nand lease liability were calculated using the CPI in effect at lease commencement and will not be subsequently adjusted.

The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the private\nplacement warrants which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. The warrants are measured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value\nrecognized in financing income, net. The change in the fair value of the derivative private warrants liability for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021 is summarized as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nBalance at the beginning of the period $ 720 $ 1,639 $ -\nPrivate warrants liability assumed in Transactions - - 7,291\nChange in fair value of warrants liability (472) (890) (1,216)\nReclassification of warrants liability to equity (8) (29) (4,436)\nBalance at the end of the year $ 240 $ 720 $ 1,639\nThe estimated fair value of the private placement warrant derivative liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Black-Scholes option pricing model are\nassumptions related to expected share price volatility, expiration, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its private warrants\nbased on implied volatility of the publicly traded warrants and the historical volatility of the company’s share price and of a selected peer companies that matches the\nexpected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve as of the valuation date for a maturity similar\nto the expiration of the warrants. The dividend yield is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero.

The Company reviews the status of each matter and assesses its\npotential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company\naccrues a liability for the estimated loss.

Upon closing of the Transactions, all issued and outstanding Preferred Shares were automatically converted into Ordinary Shares of no-par value. As such, the\nCompany reclassified the preferred shares carrying amount into permanent equity (for further information see Note 1c).\nb. Preferred shares A, B, B-1, C, and C-1 (collectively “Preferred Shares”) conferred upon their holders the same rights conferred by the Company’s legacy Ordinary\nShares (for further information see Note 11a) in addition to the following rights:\nConversion rights - the holders of the Preferred Shares were entitled, at their option, to convert the Preferred Shares into Ordinary Shares by dividing the original\nissue price for such series of Preferred Share by the conversion price for such series of Preferred Share that was in effect at the time of conversion. The initial\nconversion price would have been the respective original issue price for such series of Preferred Share. The original issue price was $0.4408, $4.6366, $3.7093,\n$5.9842 and $9.5730 per share for the Preferred A, B, B-1, C and C-1 Shares, respectively. The applicable conversion price was subject to adjustment upon share\nsplits or combinations, recapitalizations, or upon the issuance of any new securities at a price per share lower than the applicable conversion price of the Preferred\nShares, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to such issuance. The Preferred Shares would have been automatically converted into Ordinary Shares, at the then\neffective conversion price, upon the closing of the sale of the Company’s Ordinary Shares to the public in a firm commitment underwritten public offering, provided\nthat the price per share in such offering reflected at least 200% of Series C-1 Preferred Shares and that such offering results in at least $100,000 of gross proceeds to\nthe Company.\nF - 27\nINNOVIZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

OVERVIEW\nIn accordance with the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq”), Section 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”) (“Rule 10D-1”), the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Innoviz Technologies Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the State of Israel\n(the “Company”), has adopted this Policy (the “Policy”) to provide for the recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation from Executive Officers. Each\ncapitalized term used and not defined shall have the meaning set forth in Section VIII below.\nII. RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION\n(1) In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company will reasonably promptly recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received in\naccordance with the applicable rules of Nasdaq (“Nasdaq Rules”) and Rule 10D-1 as follows:\n(i) After an Accounting Restatement, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) shall determine the amount of\nany Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received by each Executive Officer, if any, and shall promptly notify each Executive Officer with a written notice\ncontaining the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return of such compensation, as applicable.\n(a) For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) the Company’s share price or total shareholder return, where the\namount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting\nRestatement:\n(x) The amount to be repaid or returned shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the\nAccounting Restatement on the Company’s share price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-based Compensation was Received;\nand\n(y) The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide the relevant\ndocumentation as required to the Nasdaq.\n(ii) The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on the\nparticular facts and circumstances, which may include, without limitation, reduction or cancellation by the Company or an affiliate of the Company of\nIncentive-Based Compensation or Erroneously Awarded Compensation, reimbursement or repayment by any person subject to this Policy of the Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation, and, to the extent permitted by law, an offset of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation against other compensation payable by the\nCompany or an affiliate of the Company to such person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in Subsection (2) below, in no event may the\nCompany accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of an Executive Officer’s obligations\nhereunder.\n(iii) To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received under\nany duplicative recovery obligations established by the Company or applicable law, including, without limitation, the Company’s Executive Compensation\nPolicy adopted in accordance with Israeli law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy.\n(iv) To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company when due, the Company\nshall take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Executive Officer. The applicable\nExecutive Officer shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including reasonable legal fees) by the Company\nin recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by Subsection (1) above if the\nCommittee determines that recovery would be impracticable and any of the following three conditions are met:\n(i) The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be\nrecovered. Before making this determination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, documented\nsuch attempt(s) and provided such documentation to the Nasdaq;\n(ii) Recovery would violate the Israeli law, provided that, before determining that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of\nErroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of the Israeli law, the Company has obtained an opinion of Israeli counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that\nrecovery would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to Nasdaq; or\n(iii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the\nCompany, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations\nthereunder.\n(3) Recovery shall be required in accordance with this Section II regardless of whether the applicable Executive Officer engaged in misconduct or\notherwise caused or contributed to the requirement for the Accounting Restatement and regardless of whether or when restated financial statements are filed by the\nCompany.\n(4) For clarity, the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy will not give rise to any person’s right to voluntarily terminate\nemployment for “good reason,” or due to a “constructive termination” (or any similar term of like effect) under any plan, program or policy of or agreement with the\nCompany or any of its affiliates.\n2\nIII. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and rules.\nIV. PROHIBITION OF INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY\nThe Company shall not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid,\nreturned or recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. None of the Company, an\naffiliate of the Company or any member of the Committee or the Board shall have any liability to any person as a result of actions taken under this Policy.\nFurther, the Company shall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid or awarded to an Executive Officer from\nthe application of this Policy or that waives the Company’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement\n(whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date of this Policy).\nV. ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee, and, subject to any permitted review by the Nasdaq pursuant to the Nasdaq Rules, any determinations made by\nthe Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) may re-vest in itself the authority to administer,\ninterpret and construe this Policy in accordance with applicable law, and in such event references herein to the “Committee” shall be deemed to be references to the Board.\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this\nPolicy and for the Company’s compliance with Nasdaq Rules, Section 10D, Rule 10D-1 and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq\npromulgated or issued in connection therewith (the “Applicable Rules”). The Committee may delegate administrative duties with respect to this Policy to one or more directors\nor employees of the Company, as permitted under applicable law, including any Applicable Rules.\nThis Policy will be interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Applicable Rules, and to the extent this Policy is inconsistent\nwith such Applicable Rules, it shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to ensure compliance therewith.\nVI. AMENDMENT; TERMINATION\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this Section\nVI to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the\nCompany contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule, Nasdaq rule or Israeli law. This Policy\nwill terminate automatically when the Company does not have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or association in the United States.\n3\nVII. OTHER RECOVERY RIGHTS\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and, to the extent required by applicable law or guidance from the SEC or Nasdaq, their\nbeneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. The Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by applicable\nlaw. Any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan or any other agreement or arrangement with an Executive Officer shall be deemed to include, as\na condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement by the Executive Officer to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant to the terms of\nany policy of the Company, including, without limitation, the Company’s Executive Compensation Policy adopted in accordance with Israeli law, or any provision in any\nemployment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, agreement or other arrangement.\nVIII. SEVERABILITY\nThe provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law; provided, however, to the extent that any provision of this Policy is found to be\nunenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted, and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner\nconsistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to any limitations required under applicable law.\nIX. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nEach Executive Officer shall sign an acknowledgment pursuant to which such Executive Officer will agree to be bound by the terms of, and comply with, this Policy;\nhowever, any Executive Officer’s failure to sign any such acknowledgment shall not negate the application of this Policy to the Executive Officer.\nX. DEFINITIONS\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below.\n(1) “Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement to correct the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting\nrequirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the\npreviously issued financial statements (a “Big R” restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left\nuncorrected in the current period (a “little r” restatement).\n(2) “Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation” means all Incentive-based Compensation Received by an Executive Officer (i) on or after the\neffective date of the applicable Nasdaq rules, (ii) after beginning service as an Executive Officer, (iii) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the\napplicable performance period relating to any Incentive-based Compensation (whether or not such Executive Officer is serving at the time the Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation is required to be repaid to the Company), (iv) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities\nassociation, and (v) during the applicable Clawback Period (as defined below).\n(3) “Clawback Period” means, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the\nRestatement Date (as defined below), and if the Company changes its fiscal year, any transition period of less than nine months within or immediately following those\nthree completed fiscal years.\n4\n(4) “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means, with respect to each Executive Officer in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the amount of\nClawback Eligible Incentive Compensation that exceeds the amount of Incentive-based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received based on a restated\nFinancial Reporting Measure had it been determined based on the restated amounts, determined on a pre-tax basis in accordance with the Applicable Rules.\n(5) “Executive Officer” means each individual who is currently or was previously designated as the Company’s principal executive officer, principal\nfinancial officer or principal accounting officer, or was otherwise identified by the Company in Item 6.A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the\nSEC as a member of the Company’s senior management (as defined in Form 20-F).\n(6) “Financial Reporting Measures” means measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing\nthe Company’s financial statements, and all other measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures.
