(Nasdaq:SIBN), a medical device company dedicated to solving sacropelvic disorders, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights** _(any comparisons are to the prior year period)_\n\n  * Worldwide revenue of $40.3 million, representing growth of ~19% \n  * U.S. revenue of $38.3 million, representing growth of ~18%\n  * Gross margin of ~79%\n  * Net loss of $6.6 million, representing an improvement of ~34%\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.2 million, representing an improvement of ~94%\n  * Ended the quarter with $150.8 million in cash and equivalents, representing $0.7 million in net cash usage\n\n\n\n**Recent Operational Highlights** _(any comparisons are to the prior year period)_\n\n  * Over 1,200 U.S. active physicians in the third quarter 2024, representing an increase of ~15%\n  * Commercialized iFuse TORQ TNT, a breakthrough device designed to address the anatomic and biomechanical challenges of pelvic fragility fractures\n  * Granted Transitional Pass-Through (TPT) payment status for CY2025 procedures reporting the use of Granite\n  * Completed enrollment of 110 patients across 15 sites for STACI, a prospective study on lateral transfixing SI joint fusion using TORQ when performed by interventional spine physicians\n  * Refinanced $36 million Term Loan, lowering all-in borrowing cost and extending maturity to 2029\n\n\n\n“The team did a tremendous job delivering record worldwide revenue and getting close to Adjusted EBITDA breakeven in the third quarter. In addition to the sequential revenue growth, the record 1,200 active physicians in the quarter demonstrates that our strategy to build anatomy specific platforms to address unmet needs is gaining momentum,” said Laura Francis, Chief Executive Officer. “Given the robust demand trends, including the excitement around Granite 9.5 and TORQ TNT, we are positioned to deliver a strong end to the year and be Adjusted EBITDA profitable in the fourth quarter. Going into 2025, we will leverage our formidable physician user base, our breakthrough devices, and our asset-lite business model to deliver strong and profitable revenue growth.”\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nWorldwide revenue was $40.3 million in the third quarter 2024, a ~19% increase from $34.0 million in the corresponding period in 2023.

Since pioneering minimally invasive SI joint surgery in 2009, SI-BONE has supported over 4,100 physicians in performing a total of over 110,000 procedures. A unique body of clinical evidence supports the use of SI-BONE’s technologies, including two randomized controlled trials and over 140 peer reviewed publications. SI-BONE has leveraged its leadership in minimally invasive SI joint fusion to commercialize novel solutions for adjacent markets, including adult deformity, sacropelvic fixation and pelvic trauma.\n\nFor additional information on the company or the products including risks and benefits, please visit [www.si-bone.com](http://www.si-bone.com).\n\niFuse Bedrock Granite, iFuse-TORQ and SI-BONE are registered trademarks of SI-BONE, Inc. iFuse TORQ TNT is a trademark of SI-BONE, Inc. ©2024 SI-BONE, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThe statements in this press release regarding expectations of future events or results, including SI-BONE’s expectations of continued revenue and procedure growth and financial outlook, contained in this press release are \"forward-looking\" statements. These forward-looking statements are based on SI-BONE's current expectations and inherently involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks include SI-BONE's ability to introduce and commercialize new products and indications, the impact of recent hurricanes including a resulting shortage in critical operating supplies on elective procedure volumes, SI-BONE's ability to maintain favorable reimbursement for procedures using its products, the impact of any future economic weakness on the ability and desire of patients to undergo elective procedures including those using SI-BONE's devices, SI-BONE's ability to manage risks to its supply chain, future capital requirements driven by new surgical systems requiring instrument tray and implant inventory investment, and the pace of the re-normalization of the healthcare operating environment including the ability and desire of patients and physicians to undergo and perform procedures using SI-BONE's devices. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are described in the company's most recent filing on Form 10-K, and the company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) available at the SEC's Internet site ([www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov)), especially under the caption \"Risk Factors.\" SI-BONE does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligations or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein, except as required by law.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nSI-BONE uses adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measures that excludes from net loss the effects of interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. SI-BONE believes the presentation of adjusted EBITDA is useful to management because it allows management to more consistently analyze period-to-period financial performance and provides meaningful supplemental information with respect to core operational activities used to evaluate management's performance. SI-BONE also believes the presentation of adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other interested persons as it enables these persons to use this additional information to assess the company’s performance in using this additional metric that management uses to assess the company’s performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA excludes the effect of items that increase or decrease SI-BONE's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review, when they become available, the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The company's definition of adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.\n\n**Investor Contact**\n\nSaqib IqbalSr. Director, FP&A and Investor Relationsinvestors@SI-BONE.com\n\n**SI-BONE, INC. ****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS****(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nRevenue | $ | 40,340 | $ | 34,014 | $ | 118,176 | $ | 100,027  \nCost of goods sold | 8,437 | 7,041 | 24,832 | 19,283  \nGross profit | 31,903 | 26,973 | 93,344 | 80,744  \nOperating expenses:  \nSales and marketing | 27,448 | 26,512 | 85,805 | 81,317  \nResearch and development | 3,993 | 3,919 | 12,690 | 10,866  \nGeneral and administrative | 8,095 | 7,711 | 24,603 | 22,986  \nTotal operating expenses | 39,536 | 38,142 | 123,098 | 115,169  \nLoss from operations | (7,633 | ) | (11,169 | ) | (29,754 | ) | (34,425 | )  \nInterest and other income (expense), net:  \nInterest income | 1,936 | 2,174 | 6,064 | 4,689  \nInterest expense | (884 | ) | (884 | ) | (2,647 | ) | (2,573 | )  \nOther income (expense), net | 6 | (143 | ) | (81 | ) | (44 | )  \nNet loss | $ | (6,575 | ) | $ | (10,022 | ) | $ | (26,418 | ) | $ | (32,353 | )  \nNet loss per share, basic and diluted | $ | (0.16 | ) | $ | (0.25 | ) | $ | (0.64 | ) | $ | (0.86 | )  \nWeighted-average number of common shares used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share | 41,717,505 | 40,265,520 | 41,324,614 | 37,702,207  \n**SI-BONE, INC. ****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS****(in thousands)****(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \nASSETS  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 30,225 | $ | 33,271  \nShort-term investments | 120,593 | 132,748  \nAccounts receivable, net | 24,909 | 21,953  \nInventory | 25,518 | 20,249  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 2,454 | 3,173  \nTotal current assets | 203,699 | 211,394  \nProperty and equipment, net | 20,748 | 16,000  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | 2,225 | 2,706  \nOther non-current assets | 326 | 325  \nTOTAL ASSETS | $ | 226,998 | $ | 230,425  \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable | $ | 7,318 | $ | 4,588  \nAccrued liabilities and other | 16,156 | 17,452  \nOperating lease liabilities, current portion | 1,210 | 1,416  \nTotal current liabilities | 24,684 | 23,456  \nLong-term borrowings | 36,192 | 36,065  \nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion | 1,135 | 1,511  \nOther long-term liabilities | 13 | 18  \nTOTAL LIABILITIES | 62,024 | 61,050  \nStockholders' Equity:  \nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital | 591,251 | 569,481  \nAccumulated other comprehensive income | 582 | 335  \nAccumulated deficit | (426,859 | ) | (400,441 | )  \nTOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY | 164,974 | 169,375  \nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY | $ | 226,998 | $ | 230,425  \n**SI-BONE, INC. ****RECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS TO NON-GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA****(In thousands)****(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet loss | $ | (6,575 | ) | $ | (10,022 | ) | $ | (26,418 | ) | $ | (32,353 | )  \nInterest income | (1,936 | ) | (2,174 | ) | (6,064 | ) | (4,689 | )  \nInterest expense | 884 | 884 | 2,647 | 2,573  \nDepreciation and amortization | 1,085 | 1,534 | 3,166 | 3,855  \nStock-based compensation | 6,306 | 5,928 | 19,733 | 18,120  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | (236 | ) | $ | (3,851 | ) | $ | (6,936 | ) | $ | (12,494 | )  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI3MTM2NiM2NTc2MzQwIzIxMjM2ODI=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZjU1NWYxYzEtY2ZhYi00Mzg4LTk1ODQtMmM1ZTkwMDhkOTMwLTExMzUyNTM=/tiny/SI-BONE-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/1630843d-d109-4819-9c6f-455c684690ba/small/sibn-logo-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/1630843d-d109-4819-9c6f-455c684690ba)\n\nSource: SI-BONE, Inc.\n\nGet the iFuse Patient Newsletter\n\n## Looking for Answers?\n\nWe can help.

TPT payment status, which will be effective up to three years beginning January 1, 2025, allows patient access to new and innovative technology like Granite by providing an add-on payment to hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers supporting it.\n\nAs part of the TPT determination, CMS confirmed that a customary deduction from the add-on payment, known as a device offset, will not be applied to lumbar spinal fusion procedures involving pelvic fixation with Granite. This decision recognizes that Granite costs are not currently included in the existing facility payment amount for the procedures using this technology.\n\n“We are pleased that CMS has acknowledged the importance of providing outpatient-based Granite procedures with TPT payment status and no device offset, allowing hospitals to maintain their usual facility payment rates for lumbar fusion procedures, while receiving TPT payment for Granite implants they report as part of the Medicare cases they support,” said Laura Francis, CEO of SI-BONE. “With a growing number of specialty degenerative spine procedures moving to the outpatient setting, the additional reimbursement for Granite ensures that patients and surgeons can access new technology and procedures without regard to the site of service in which they are performed.”\n\nAccording to CMS, a “Transitional Pass-Through” payment is a temporary, additional payment provided to healthcare providers for new, innovative technologies like Granite, allowing patients better access while CMS supports hospitals and gathers data to accurately incorporate their cost into standard facility payment rates. Its intent is to provide an incentive for the use of new medical advances by supplying a higher reimbursement to the facility in which they are used for up to three years.\n\nGranted BDD in November 2021 and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2022, Granite is intended to provide fusion and fixation to the pelvis when used in conjunction with certain pedicle screw fixation systems as a foundational element for segmental spinal fusion. In finalizing its decision, CMS noted the uniqueness of the device’s porous surface and interstices, and that fixation occurs through the device’s helical threaded design and traditional posterior fixation rod connection. Every year, approximately 130,000 lumbar spinal fusion procedures that end at the pelvis are performed in the United States to treat adult deformity and degenerative spine conditions.\n\n**About SI-BONE, Inc.** SI-BONE (NASDAQ: SIBN) is a global leader in technology for surgical treatment of sacropelvic disorders. Since pioneering minimally invasive surgery of the SI joint in 2009, SI-BONE has supported over 3,900 surgeons in performing a total of more than 100,000 sacropelvic procedures. A unique body of clinical evidence supports the use of SI-BONE’s technologies, including two randomized controlled trials and over 140 peer reviewed publications.
