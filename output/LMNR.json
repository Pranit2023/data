This strong market response positions us to achieve record avocado revenue this fiscal year. Further, we anticipate reaching a milestone as our avocado segment is expected to contribute approximately four million to five million pounds in our seasonably softer fourth quarter for the first time in our company’s history. These results validate our strategic decision to significantly expand our avocado production by 1,000 acres over the next three years. In addition to our agricultural success, our real estate development joint venture, Harvest at Limoneira (“Harvest”), has seen increased momentum in the current lower interest rate environment with steady home sales. The expansion of avocado production, coupled with the ongoing expected earnings from Harvest, reinforces our confidence in achieving strong EBITDA growth into the future. The success across multiple segments of our business underscores our commitment to sustainable growth and value creation for our stockholders.” \n\nMr. Edwards continued, “Since announcing our exploration of strategic alternatives, we have received interest and are diligently working with our advisors at Stephens, Inc to engage with these and other parties to evaluate potential opportunities. We remain committed to thoroughly exploring all options to maximize stockholder value and will provide updates if the board of directors find that further disclosure is necessary or advisable.” \n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Third Quarter Results**\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, total net revenue was $63.3 million, compared to total net revenue of $52.5 million in the third quarter of the previous fiscal year. Agribusiness revenue was $61.8 million, compared to $51.1 million in the third quarter of last fiscal year. Other operations revenue was $1.5 million, compared to $1.4 million in the third quarter of last fiscal year. \n\nAgribusiness revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 includes $25.8 million in fresh packed lemon sales, compared to $24.2 million of fresh packed lemon sales during the same period of fiscal year 2023. Approximately 1,400,000 cartons of U.S. packed fresh lemons were sold in aggregate during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 at a $18.43 average price per carton, compared to approximately 1,352,000 cartons sold at a $17.92 average price per carton during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Brokered lemons and other lemon sales were $9.8 million and $8.0 million, in the third quarter of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nThe Company recognized $13.9 million of avocado revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to $3.5 million in the third quarter of last fiscal year. Approximately 8,855,000 pounds of avocados were sold in aggregate during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 at a $1.57 average price per pound, compared to approximately 2,822,000 pounds sold at a $0.99 average price per pound during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. \n\nThe Company recognized $1.2 million of orange revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to $1.3 million in the same period of fiscal year 2023. Approximately 43,000 cartons of oranges were sold during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 at a $26.98 average price per carton, compared to approximately 71,000 cartons sold at a $18.17 average price per carton during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. \n\nSpecialty citrus and other crops revenue was $0.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to $1.9 million in the same period of fiscal year 2023. During the third quarter of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, approximately 25,000 and 70,000 40-pound carton equivalents were sold at an average per carton price of $22.00 and $25.88, respectively. \n\nFarm management revenues were $3.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to $5.4 million in the same period of fiscal year 2023 on similar acreage. The decrease in farm management revenues in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was primarily due to farm management decisions based on weather and crop conditions. \n\nTotal costs and expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 were $54.3 million, compared to $54.0 million in the third quarter of last fiscal year. \n\nOperating income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $9.0 million, compared to operating loss of $1.5 million in the third quarter of the previous fiscal year. \n\nNet income applicable to common stock, after preferred dividends, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $6.5 million, compared to net loss applicable to common stock of $1.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $0.35, compared to net loss per diluted share of $0.07 for the same period of fiscal year 2023. \n\nAdjusted net income for diluted EPS in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $7.8 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 of $0.4 million or $0.02 per diluted share. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Limoneira Company to adjusted net income (loss) for diluted EPS is provided at the end of this release. \n\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $13.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to $2.8 million in the same period of fiscal year 2023. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Limoneira Company to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is provided at the end of this release. \n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 First Nine Months Results**\n\nFor the nine months ended July 31, 2024, total net revenue was $147.6 million, compared to $138.5 million for the same period in fiscal year 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased lemons and avocados agribusiness revenues, partially offset by decreased specialty citrus and other crops agribusiness revenues. Operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 was $3.4 million, compared to operating income of $20.5 million in the same period last fiscal year primarily due to net gain on disposal of assets. Net income applicable to common stock, after preferred dividends, was $9.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, compared to $12.5 million in the same period last fiscal year. Net income per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 was $0.51, compared to net income per diluted share of $0.69 in the same period of fiscal year 2023. \n\nFor the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, adjusted net income for diluted EPS was $12.9 million compared to adjusted net loss for diluted EPS of $5.0 million for the same period in fiscal year 2023. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.70 compared to adjusted net loss per diluted share of $0.28 for the same period in fiscal year 2023, based on approximately 18.3 million and 17.6 million, respectively, adjusted weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. \n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nDuring the nine months ended July 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $11.3 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $12.6 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Net cash used in investing activities was $6.7 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $92.4 million in the same period last fiscal year. For the nine months ended July 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $7.1 million, compared to $69.6 million in the prior fiscal year. \n\nOn January 31, 2023, the Company sold its Northern Properties, which resulted in total net proceeds of $98.4 million. The proceeds were used to pay down all the Company’s domestic debt except the AgWest Farm Credit $40.0 million non-revolving line of credit with an interest rate that is fixed at 3.57% through July 1, 2025. Long-term debt as of July 31, 2024, was $40.0 million, compared to $40.6 million at the end of fiscal year 2023. Debt levels as of July 31, 2024, less $1.1 million of cash on hand, resulted in a net debt position of $39.6 million at quarter end. However, as previously noted, the Company’s 50%/50% real estate development joint venture with The Lewis Group of Companies (Lewis”) closed an additional 554 residential homesites in April 2024. The joint venture distributed $30.0 million in June 2024, of which Limoneira received $15.0 million. As of July 31, 2024, the joint venture had $69.9 million of unaudited cash and cash equivalents on hand. \n\n**Real Estate Development and Property Sales**\n\nThe Company’s joint venture with Lewis for the residential development of its Harvest real estate development project was previously approved for approximately 1,500 total residential units built and sold over the life of the project. In October 2023, the joint venture closed on lot sales representing 121 residential units, thus completing the sell-out of Phase 1 of the development. In April 2024, the joint venture closed on lot sales representing 554 residential units, thus completing the sell-out of Phase 2 of the development. Total lot sales of 1,261 residential units closed since the project’s inception. In May 2024, the Company announced that the Santa Paula City Council approved the proposal brought forward by the joint venture to increase the total number of residential units for the project from 1,500 to 2,050 units. The 550-unit increase will provide 250 additional single family for-sale homesites within Phase 3 of Harvest. A separate joint venture with Lewis plans to construct 300 multi-family rental homes on a mixed-use portion of the project. \n\n**Updated Guidance**\n\nThe Company now expects avocado volumes to be in the range of 14.5 million to 15.5 million pounds for fiscal year 2024, compared to previous guidance of 9.0 million to 10.0 million pounds, a more than 50% increase compared to prior guidance. We expect to complete the avocado harvest in the fourth quarter with approximately 4.0 million to 5.0 million pounds remaining. \n\nThe Company now expects fresh lemon volumes to be in the range of 4.5 million to 5.0 million cartons for fiscal year 2024, compared to previous guidance of 5.0 million to 5.5 million cartons, due to lower fresh utilization from late season rains. The lemon harvest for fiscal year 2024 is approximately 85% complete. \n\nThe Company continues to expect to receive total future proceeds of $180 million from Harvest, LLCB II, LLC and East Area II spread out over the next seven fiscal years. \n\n**_Harvest at Limoneira Cash Flow Projections (in millions)_**\n\nFiscal Year  |  **2024** |  **2025** |  **2026** |  **2027** |  **2028** |  **2029** |  **2030**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nProjected Distributions  |  _$18_ |  _$8_ |  _$15_ |  _$34_ |  _$41_ |  _$22_ |  _$42_  \n  \nThe Company has 600 acres of non-bearing lemons and avocados estimated to become full bearing over the next four to five years, which the Company expects will enable strong organic growth in the coming years. Additionally, the Company plans to expand its plantings of avocados over the next three years and expects to have an increase in third-party grower fruit. The foregoing describes organic growth opportunities and does not include potential acquisition opportunities for the Company in its highly fragmented industry. \n\nLooking ahead, we continue to see a strong EBITDA outlook that is underpinned by plans to expand avocado production by 1,000 acres over the next three years to capitalize on robust consumer demand trends. During this transition, the Company expects fiscal year 2025 avocado volume to be lower compared to fiscal year 2024 due to the alternate bearing nature of avocado trees and the Company believes avocado pricing may be slightly lower compared to the current year pricing environment due to international circumstances. These operational results do not take into account expected additional earnings from Harvest at Limoneira. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its financial results on September 9, 2024, at 1:30 pm Pacific Time (4:30 pm Eastern Time). Investors interested in participating in the live call can dial (877) 407-0789 from the U.S. International callers can dial (201) 689-8562.

associated with the nature of the Company's operations and interest costs associated with our capital structure, management believes that earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes stock-based compensation, pension settlement cost, impairment of intangible asset, (gain) loss on disposal of assets, net, cash bonus related to sale of assets, gain on legal settlement and severance benefits are important measures to evaluate our results of operations between periods on a more comparable basis. Such measurements are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and should not be construed as an alternative to reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP information provided is unique to the Company and may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies. \n\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are summarized and reconciled to net income (loss) attributable to Limoneira Company, which management considers to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, as follows (in thousands): \n\n**Three Months Ended****July 31 ,** |  **Nine Months Ended****July 31 ,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet income (loss) attributable to Limoneira Company |  $  |  6,593  |  $  |  (1,163  |  )  |  $  |  9,575  |  $  |  12,855   \nInterest income  |  (27  |  )  |  (178  |  )  |  (63  |  )  |  (248  |  )   \nInterest expense, net of patronage dividends  |  273  |  241  |  831  |  417   \nIncome tax provision (benefit)  |  3,019  |  (378  |  )  |  4,051  |  5,537   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  2,115  |  2,019  |  6,273  |  6,510   \nEBITDA  |  11,973  |  541  |  20,667  |  25,071   \nStock-based compensation  |  1,204  |  756  |  3,139  |  2,785   \nPension settlement cost  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  2,741   \nImpairment of intangible asset  |  643  |  —  |  643  |  —   \n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net  |  (12  |  )  |  1,545  |  (129  |  )  |  (29,199  |  )   \nCash bonus related to sale of assets  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  2,000   \nGain on legal settlement  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (2,269  |  )   \nSeverance benefits  |  (17  |  )  |  —  |  1,198  |  —   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  13,791  |  $  |  2,842  |  $  |  25,518  |  $  |  1,129   \n  \nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Limoneira Company to adjusted net income (loss) for diluted EPS (in thousands, except per share data): \n\n**Three Months Ended****July 31 ,** |  **Nine Months Ended****July 31 ,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet income (loss) attributable to Limoneira Company |  $  |  6,593  |  $  |  (1,163  |  )  |  $  |  9,575  |  $  |  12,855   \nEffect of preferred stock and unvested, restricted stock  |  (115  |  )  |  (152  |  )  |  (212  |  )  |  (439  |  )   \nStock-based compensation  |  1,204  |  756  |  3,139  |  2,785   \nPension settlement cost  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  2,741   \nImpairment of intangible asset  |  643  |  —  |  643  |  —   \n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net  |  (12  |  )  |  1,545  |  (129  |  )  |  (29,199  |  )   \nCash bonus related to sale of assets  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  2,000   \nGain on legal settlement  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (2,269  |  )   \nSeverance benefits  |  (17  |  )  |  —  |  1,198  |  —   \nTax effect of adjustments at federal and state rates  |  (499  |  )  |  (628  |  )  |  (1,331  |  )  |  6,539   \nAdjusted net income (loss) for diluted EPS  |  $  |  7,797  |  $  |  358  |  $  |  12,883  |  $  |  (4,987  |  )   \nDiluted net income (loss) per common share  |  $  |  0.35  |  $  |  (0.07  |  )  |  $  |  0.51  |  $  |  0.69   \nAdjusted diluted net income (loss) per common share  |  $  |  0.42  |  $  |  0.02  |  $  |  0.70  |  $  |  (0.28  |  )   \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding -

Limoneira is proud to be a leader in educating consumers about how to eat their way to optimum health naturally.”\n\nWe’ve cross-tabulated 55 health concerns including the need to increase good cholesterol, prevent cardiovascular disease or ease insomnia, as well as desired outcomes, including improving energy levels or reducing wrinkles, with 74 fruits and vegetables. All of these foods, which can be found in the produce section of most grocery stores, contain 12 essential vitamins and 11 essential minerals that address these concerns or help with desired outcomes. By selecting a concern or outcome, the app then generates foods in the produce aisle that can help consumers achieve their health goals.\n\n“Nature’s Pharmacy and Take a Healthy Stand are important components of the Food as Medicine movement taking hold nationwide,” said Megan Roosevelt, a Limoneira nutritionist and founder of Healthy Grocery Girl®. “Food as Medicine maintains that fresh, healthy produce such as lemons can help avoid an expensive and perhaps less effective trip to the grocery department’s supplement aisle.”\n\nThis app is just one of several educational platforms to be launched as part of our Take a Healthy Stand™ platform, which showcases the many ways that citrus and produce can play a role in helping to alleviate serious health issues as well as enhancing personal appearance and wellbeing. The foundation underpinning our Take A Healthy Stand™ educational campaign is consumer-friendly messaging supported by research by the Institute of National Health and other objective organizations.\n\n× \n\nAnti-Aging and Skin Health \n\nCertain diet and lifestyle factors can speed up the aging process which may have a negative effect on your health and physical appearance. For example, oxidative damage from the build-up of free radicals speeds up the aging process which can result in wrinkles, age spots, dryness and decreased skin elasticity. The National Institute of Health has published research studies that have demonstrated that antioxidants may help slow aging and improve skin health. One simple way to consume more antioxidants and prevent aging is to consume lemons. Both the peel and juice are rich in Vitamin C, an antioxidant that also supports collagen production which important for skin elasticity and skin health. The pectin in lemon rind can also help with weight loss. Lemons also contain limonene which is used in cosmetics and also in a range of other items, such as fragrance and bath products.\n\n× \n\nPotential To Help Prevent Cancer \n\nContinued emerging research published in the National Institute of Health reveals that what you eat – and don’t eat – may help prevent certain types of cancers. For example, LEMON juice successfully inhibits the growth of several types of cancer cells. Hesperidin and d-limonene (plant Compounds found in LEMONS) have both been shown to have cancer-preventing properties.\n\n× \n\nCardiovascular (Heart) Health Benefits \n\nDiet and lifestyle both play a huge role in heart disease prevention. Studies published in the Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism have shown that hesperidin and diosmin (plant compounds in LEMONS) have been found to help lower cholesterol. It has also been demonstrated that walking and eating lemons every day is associated with a decrease in blood pressure.\n\n× \n\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.
