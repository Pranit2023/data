The Company then offered management and consulting services to residential and commercial real estate property owners who rent or lease\ntheir property to third party tenants.\nThe Company changed its name to FingerMotion, Inc. on July 13, 2017 after a change in control. In July 2017 the Company acquired all of the outstanding\nshares of Finger Motion Company Limited (“FMCL”), a Hong Kong corporation that is an information technology company which specialize in operating\nand publishing mobile games.\nPursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement with FMCL, effective July 13, 2017 (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), the Company agreed to exchange the\noutstanding equity stock of FMCL held by the FMCL Shareholders for shares of common stock of the Company. At the Closing Date, the Company issued\n12,000,000 shares of common stock to the FMCL shareholders. In addition, the Company issued 600,000 shares to other consultants in connection with the\ntransactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement.\nThe transaction was accounted for as a “reverse acquisition” since, immediately following completion of the transaction, the shareholders of FMCL\neffectuated control of the post-combination Company. For accounting purposes, FMCL was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and,\nconsequently, the transaction is treated as a recapitalization of FMCL (i.e., a capital transaction involving the issuance of shares by the Company for the\nshares of FMCL). Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations of FMCL became the historical financial statements of\nFingerMotion, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and the Company’s assets, liabilities and results of operations were consolidated with FMCL beginning on the\nacquisition date. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill were recorded in this transaction.\nAs a result of the Share Exchange Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereunder, FMCL became a wholly owned subsidiary of the\nCompany. FMCL, a Hong Kong corporation, was formed in April 6, 2016.\nOn October 16, 2018, the Company through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Shanghai JiuGe Business Management Co., Ltd. (“JiuGe Management”),\nentered into a series of agreements known as variable interest agreements (the “VIE Agreements”) pursuant to which Shanghai JiuGe Information\nTechnology Co., Ltd. (“JiuGe Technology”) became JiuGe Management’s contractually controlled affiliate. The use of VIE agreements is a common\nstructure used to acquire PRC corporations, particularly in certain industries in which foreign investment is restricted or forbidden by the PRC government.\nThe VIE Agreements include a Consulting Services Agreement, a Loan Agreement, a Power of Attorney Agreement, a Call Option Agreement, and a Share\nPledge Agreement in order to secure the connection and commitments of JiuGe Technology.\nOn March 7, 2019, JiuGe Technology also acquired 99% of the equity interest of Beijing XunLian (“BX”), a subsidiary that provides bulk distribution of\nSMS messages for JiuGe Technology customers at discounted rates.\nFinger Motion Financial Company Limited was incorporated on January 24, 2020 and is 100% owned by FingerMotion, Inc. The company has been\nactivated for the insurtech business during the last quarter of the fiscal year 2021 where the Big Data division secured its first contract and recorded\nrevenue.\nShanghai TengLian JiuJiu Information Communication Technology Co., Ltd. was incorporated on December 23, 2020 for the purpose of venturing into the\nmobile phone sales in China. It is 99% owned by JiuGe Technology.\nOn February 5, 2021, JiuGe Technology disposed of its 99% owned subsidiary, Suzhou BuGuNiao Digital Technology Co., Ltd., which was established to\nventure into R&D projects.\n10\nFINGERMOTION, INC.\nSix months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 – Nature of Business and basis of Presentation (continued)\nShanghai KeShunXiang Automobile Service Co., Ltd. was incorporated on April 10, 2024 for the purpose of venturing into the communication and\nstreaming services in China. It is 99% owned by JiuGe Technology.\nNote 2 - Summary of Principal Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Presentation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\naccounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nVariable interest entity\nPursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Section 810, “Consolidation” (“ASC 810”), the\nCompany is required to include in its consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of its variable interest entities (“VIEs”). ASC 810 requires\na VIE to be consolidated if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE’s residual\nreturns. VIEs are those entities in which a company, through contractual arrangements, bears the risk of, and enjoys the rewards normally associated with\nownership of the entity, and therefore the company is the primary beneficiary of the entity.\nUnder ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the\nfollowing characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance; and (b) the\nobligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The reporting entity’s determination of whether\nit has this power is not affected by the existence of kick-out rights or participating rights, unless a single enterprise, including its related parties and de -\nfacto agents, have the unilateral ability to exercise those rights. JiuGe Technology’s actual stockholders do not hold any kick-out rights that affect the\nconsolidation determination.\nThrough the VIE agreements disclosed in Note 1, the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of JiuGe Technology. Accordingly, the results of JiuGe\nTechnology have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. JiuGe Technology has no assets that are collateral for or restricted\nsolely to settle their obligations. The creditors of JiuGe Technology do not have recourse to the Company’s general credit.\n11\nFINGERMOTION, INC.\nSix months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 2 - Summary of Principal Accounting Policies (Continued)\nThe following assets and liabilities of the VIE and VIE’s subsidiaries are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the\nCompany as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024:\nAssets and liabilities of the VIE\nAugust 31, 2024 February 29, 2024\n(unaudited)\nCurrent assets $ 13,480,890 $ 10,578,657\nNon-current assets 215,160 53,109\nTotal assets $ 13,696,050 $ 10,631,766\nCurrent liabilities $ 13,473,420 $ 9,654,896\nNon-current liabilities 70,962 —\nTotal liabilities $ 13,544,382 $ 9,654,896\nAssets and liabilities of the VIE Subsidiary\nAugust 31, 2024 February 29, 2024\n(unaudited)\nCurrent assets $ 13,385,328 $ 4,826,781\nNon-current assets 5,685 6,088\nTotal assets $ 13,391,013 $ 4,832,869\nCurrent liabilities $ 18,028,652 $ 9,181,719\nNon-current liabilities — —\nTotal liabilities $ 18,028,652 $ 9,181,719\n12\nFINGERMOTION, INC.\nSix months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 2 - Summary of Principal Accounting Policies (Continued)\nOperating Result of VIE\nFor the Six Months For the Six Months\nEnded Ended\nAugust 31, 2024 August 31, 2023\n(unaudited) (unaudited)\nRevenue $ 3,941,998 $ 13,654,271\nCost of revenue (3,506,562) (11,604,478)\nGross profit $ 435,436 $ 2,049,793\nAmortization and depreciation (12,021) (12,750)\nGeneral and administrative expenses (1,020,074) (1,128,927)\nMarketing cost (68,537) (3,865)\nResearch & development (194,198) (168,503)\nTotal operating expenses $ (1,294,830) $ (1,314,045)\nNet profit (loss) from operations $ (859,394) $ 735,748\nInterest income 32,186 36,410\nOther income 4,065 67,452\nTotal other income $ 36,251 $ 103,862\nTax expense — —\nNet profit (loss) $ (823,143) $ 839,610\nOperating Result of VIE Subsidiaries\nFor the Six Months For the Six Months\nEnded Ended\nAugust 31, 2024 August 31, 2023\n(unaudited) (unaudited)\nRevenue $ 12,890,748 $ 7,637,734\nCost of revenue (12,343,267) (7,339,696)\nGross profit $ 547,481 $ 298,038\nAmortization and depreciation (477) (489)\nGeneral and administrative expenses (662,358) (144,805)\nMarketing cost (65,569) (47,731)\nResearch & development (44,503) (41,635)\nTotal operating expenses $ (772,907) $ (234,660)\nNet profit (loss) from operations $ (225,426) $ 63,378\nInterest income 13 311\nOther income 441 72\nTotal other income $ 454 $ 383\nTax expense — —\nNet profit (loss) $ (224,972) $ 63,761\n13\nFINGERMOTION, INC.\nSix months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 2 - Summary of Principal Accounting Policies (Continued)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes its best\nestimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Company relies on cloud-based hosting through a global accredited hosting provider. Management believes that alternate sources are available;\nhowever, disruption or termination of this relationship could adversely affect our operating results in the near-term.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nIdentifiable intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized over 3-10 years. Similar to tangible property and equipment, the Company periodically\nevaluates identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be\nrecoverable.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) computer and office equipment; (ii) furniture and fixtures, (iii) leasehold improvements, and (iv) finite\n– lived intangible assets.\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nof such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology, economy or other industry\nchanges. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash\nflows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not\nrecoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is\ndetermined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, relief from royalty income approach, quoted market values and\nthird-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nThe Company makes various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the\nrespective assets. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are complex and\nsubjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as the\nCompany’s business strategy and its forecasts for specific market expansion.\nAccounts Receivable and Concentration of Risk\nAccounts receivable, net is stated at the amount the Company expects to collect, or the net realizable value. The Company provides a provision for\nallowances that includes returns, allowances and doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company estimates its provision for\nallowances based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the\nCompany’s estimate of the provision for allowances will change.\n14\nFINGERMOTION, INC.\nSix months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 2 - Summary of Principal Accounting Policies (Continued)\nLease\nOperating and finance lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the future lease\npayments over the lease term. When the rate implicit to the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate in\ndetermining the present value of the future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease\ncommencement date and represents the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and\namount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The right-of-use asset includes any lease payments made and lease incentives\nreceived prior to the commencement date. Operating lease right-of-use assets also include any cumulative prepaid or accrued rent when the lease payments\nare uneven throughout the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably\ncertain that the Company will exercise that option.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments placed with banks, which have original\nmaturities of three months or less and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for financial reporting\npurposes at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives range from three to seven years. Land is classified as held for sale\nwhen management has the ability and intent to sell, in accordance with ASC Topic 360-45.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic (loss) earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential\ncommon shares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share.\nFASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 (“ASC 260”), “Earnings Per Share,” requires that employee equity share options, non-vested shares\nand similar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per\nshare should be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited, unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses\nthe “treasury stock” method for equity instruments granted in share-based payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per\nshare. Antidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share as their\nimpact was antidilutive.\n15\nFINGERMOTION, INC.\nSix months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 2 - Summary of Principal Accounting Policies (Continued)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) beginning on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective\napproach. ASC 606 establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising\nfrom the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of\ngoods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services\nrecognized as performance obligations are satisfied.\nThe Company has assessed the impact of the guidance by reviewing its existing customer contracts and current accounting policies and practices to identify\ndifferences that will result from applying the new requirements, including the evaluation of its performance obligations, transaction price, customer\npayments, transfer of control and principal versus agent considerations. Based on the assessment, the Company concluded that there was no change to the\ntiming and pattern of revenue recognition for its current revenue streams in scope of ASC 606 and therefore there was no material changes to the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption of ASC 606.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from providing hosting and integration services and licensing the use of its technology platform to its customers. The\nCompany recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been\nprovided to the customer (for licensing, revenue is recognized when the Company’s technology is used to provide hosting and integration services); (3) the\namount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of fees is probable. We account for our multi-element\narrangements, such as instances where we design a custom website and separately offer other services such as hosting, which are recognized over the\nperiod for when services are performed.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740,\n“Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”). Under this method, income tax expense is recognized as the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year\nand (ii) future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their\nrespective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years which those\ntemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the\nresults of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on\nthe weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nNon-controlling interest\nNon-controlling interests held 1% of the shares of two of our subsidiaries are recorded as a component of our equity, separate from the Company’s equity.\nPurchase or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Results of operations attributable to\nthe non-controlling interest are included in our consolidated results of operations and, upon loss of control, the interest sold, as well as interest retained, if\nany, will be reported at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company does not believe recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the\nconsolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.\n16\nFINGERMOTION, INC.\nSix months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 3 - Going Concern\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which\ncontemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

The Company will need to secure additional funds through various means, including equity and debt financing\nor any similar financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing, if and when needed, on\nterms acceptable to the Company, or at all. Any additional equity or debt financing may involve substantial dilution to the Company’s stockholders,\nrestrictive covenants or high interest costs. The Company’s long-term liquidity also depends upon its ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability.\nNote 4 - Revenue\nWe recorded $16,832,746 and $21,448,257 in revenue, respectively, for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023.\nFor the six months ended\nAugust 31, 2024 August 31, 2023\n(unaudited) (unaudited)\nTelecommunication Products & Services $ 8,636,452 $ 21,205,492\nSMS & MMS Business 8,167,564 16,313\nCommand & Communication 28,730 —\nBig Data — 226,452\n$ 16,832,746 $ 21,448,257\nNote 5 – Equipment\nAt August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, the company has the following amounts related to equipment:\nAugust 31, 2024 February 29, 2024\n(unaudited)\nEquipment $ 120,993 $ 117,961\nLess: accumulated depreciation (86,719) (72,255)\nNet equipment $ 34,274 $ 45,706\nNo significant residual value is estimated for the equipment.

In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks, uncertainties and assumptions set forth in reports and\nother documents we have filed with or furnished to the SEC and, including, without limitation, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six months\nended August 31, 2024, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024, including the consolidated financial statements\nand related notes contained therein. These factors, or any one of them, may cause our actual results or actions in the future to differ materially from any\nforward-looking statement made in this document. Refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements” as disclosed in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024, and Item 1A - Risk Factors, under Part II - Other Information of this Quarterly Report.\nIntroduction\nThis MD&A is focused on material changes in our financial condition from February 29, 2024, our most recently completed year end, to August 31, 2024,\nand our results of operations for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, and should be read in conjunction with Item 7, Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29,\n2024.\nCorporate Information\nThe Company was initially incorporated as Property Management Corporation of America on January 23, 2014 in the State of Delaware.\nOn June 21, 2017, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding common stock,\nto increase the authorized shares of common stock to 200,000,000 shares and to change the name of the Company from “Property Management\nCorporation of America” to “FingerMotion, Inc.” (the “Corporate Actions”). The Corporate Actions and the amended certificate of incorporation became\neffective on June 21, 2017.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 111 Somerset Road, Level 3, Singapore 238164, and our telephone number is (347) 349-5339.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in Delaware and not an operating company incorporated in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or\n“China”). As a holding company, we conduct a significant part of our operations through our subsidiaries and through the VIE Agreements with the VIE\nbased in China.\n27\nThe following diagram depicts our corporate structure:\nOur holding company structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our subsidiaries or the VIE, and will be\ndependent upon contributions from our subsidiaries and the VIE to finance our cash flow needs. Our subsidiaries and the VIE are currently not required to\nobtain permission from the Chinese authorities including the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”), or Cybersecurity Administration\nCommittee (the “CAC”), to operate or to issue securities to foreign investors. However, as of March 31, 2023, pursuant to the Overseas Listing Trial\nMeasures promulgated by the CSRC, we will be required to file with the CSRC with respect to a new offering of our securities. The business of our\nsubsidiaries and the VIE until now are not subject to cybersecurity review with the CAC, given that: (i) data processed in our business does not have a\nbearing on national security and thus may not be classified as core or important data by the authorities; (ii) we do not possess a large amount of personal\ninformation in our business operations. In addition, we are not subject to merger control review by China’s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the\nlevel of our revenues which provided from us and audited by our auditor and the fact that we currently do not expect to propose or implement any\nacquisition of control of, or decisive influence over, any company with revenues within China of more than RMB400 million. Currently, these statements\nand regulatory actions have had no impact on our daily business operations, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or\nother foreign exchange. However, since these statements and regulatory actions, including the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, are new, it is uncertain\nwhat potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and\nlist our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange.\n28\nTo operate, the VIE and Beijing XunLian TianXia Technology Co., Ltd. are required to obtain, and have obtained, a value-added telecommunications\nbusiness licence from PRC authorities. In connection with our previous issuance of securities to foreign investors, under current PRC laws, regulations and\nregulatory rules, as of the date of this periodic report on Form 10-Q, we, our PRC subsidiaries and the VIE, (i) are not required to obtain permissions from\nthe CSRC except that as of March 31, 2023 we will be required to file with the CSRC with respect to a new offering of our securities, (ii) are not required\nto go through cybersecurity review by the CAC, and (iii) have received or were not denied such requisite permissions by any PRC authority. If we, our\nsubsidiaries or the VIE (i) do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals, (ii) inadvertently conclude that such permissions or approvals are not\nrequired or (iii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required to obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, we may be\nsubject to government enforcement actions, investigations, penalties, sanctions and fines imposed by the CSRC, the CAC and relevant departments of the\nState Council. In severe circumstances, the business of our PRC subsidiary may be ordered to suspend and its business qualifications and licenses may be\nrevoked.\nTo address challenges resulting from laws, policies and practices that may disfavor foreign-owned entities that operate within industries deemed sensitive\nby the Chinese government, we use the VIE structure to provide contractual exposure to foreign investment in the PRC-based companies. We own 100% of\nthe equity of a WFOE, Shanghai JiuGe Business Management Co., Ltd. (“JiuGe Management”), which has entered into the VIE Agreements with the\nVIE, which is owned by Ms. Li Li the legal representative and general manager, and also the shareholder of the VIE. The VIE Agreements have not been\ntested in court. As a result of our use of the VIE structure, you may never directly hold equity interests in the VIE. Any securities that we offer will be\nsecurities of the Company, the Delaware holding company, not of the VIE.\nWe fund the registered capital and operating expenses of the VIE by extending loans to the shareholders of the VIE. The VIE Agreements governing the\nrelationship between the VIE and our WFOE enable us to (i) direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic\nperformance, (ii) receive substantially all of the economic benefits of the VIE, and (iii) have an exclusive call option to purchase, at any time, all or part of\nthe equity interests in and/or assets of the VIE to the extent permitted by Chinese laws. As a result of the VIE Agreements, the Company is considered the\nprimary beneficiary of the VIE for accounting purposes and is able to consolidate the financial results of the VIE in its consolidated financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result, investors in our Common Shares are not purchasing an equity interest in the VIE but instead are purchasing\nequity interest in FingerMotion, Inc., a Delaware holding company.\nShare Exchange Agreement\nEffective July 13, 2017, the Company entered into that certain Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) by and among the\nCompany, Finger Motion Company Limited, a Hong Kong corporation (“FMCL”) and certain shareholders of FMCL (the “FMCL Shareholders”).\nFMCL, a Hong Kong corporation, was formed on April 6, 2016, and is an information technology company that specializes in operating and publishing\nmobile games. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to exchange the outstanding equity stock of FMCL held by the FMCL\nShareholders for shares of common stock of the Company. On the closing date of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 12,000,000 shares\nof common stock to the FMCL shareholders. In addition, the Company issued 600,000 shares to consultants in connection with the transactions\ncontemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, and 2,562,500 additional shares to accredited investors, which was a concurrent financing but not a\ncondition of closing the Share Exchange Agreement.\nAs a result of the Share Exchange Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereunder, FMCL became a wholly owned subsidiary of the\nCompany. The Company operates its video game division through FMCL. However, in June 2018, the Company decided to pause the operation of the\ngame division as it saw the opportunity in the telecommunication business and have since refocused into this business.\n29\nThis description of the Share Exchange Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Share\nExchange Agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 20, 2017 and incorporated by reference\nherein.\nVIE Agreements\nOn October 16, 2018, the Company, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Shanghai JiuGe Business Management Co., Ltd. (“JiuGe\nManagement”), entered into a series of agreements known as variable interest agreements (the “VIE Agreements”) pursuant to which Shanghai JiuGe\nInformation Technology Co., Ltd. (“JiuGe Technology”) became our contractually controlled affiliate. The use of VIE agreements is a common structure\nused to acquire PRC corporations, particularly in certain industries in which foreign investment is restricted or forbidden by the PRC government. The VIE\nAgreements include a Consulting Services Agreement, a Loan Agreement, a Power of Attorney Agreement, a Call Option Agreement, and a Share Pledge\nAgreement in order to secure the connection and commitments of JiuGe Technology. We operate our mobile payment platform business through JiuGe\nTechnology.\nThe VIE Agreements included:\n● a consulting services agreement through which JiuGe Management is mainly engaged in data marketing, technical services, technical consulting\nand business consultancy to JiuGe Technology (the “JiuGe Technology Consulting Services Agreement”). This agreement was duly signed\namong the WFOE and the VIE. Under this agreement, the WFOE will provide the following services to the VIE on an exclusive basis: (i)\nproviding a comprehensive solution for all technical issues required for the VIE’s business; (ii) providing training to the professional technicians\nof the VIE; (iii) assisting the VIE in collecting technical and commercial information and conducting market surveys; (iv) assisting the VIE in\nprocuring business opportunities to obtain contracts awarded by the telecom carries in China and maintaining the commercial relationship with the\ntelecom carries; (v) introducing clients to the VIE and assisting the VIE in developing commercial and cooperative relationship with the clients;\n(vi) providing suggestions and opinions on establishment and improvement of the VIE’s corporate structure, management system and\ndepartmental organization; (vii) assisting the VIE in formulating annual business plans, the draft of which shall be made available to WFOE by the\nVIE prior to the end of November each year; (viii) granting license to the VIE to use WFOE’s intellectual property necessary for the services; and\n(ix) providing other consulting and technical services at the request of the VIE. The VIE will pay to the WFOE service fees equivalent to the after-\ntax net profits distributable by the VIE to its shareholder each year, as set forth in the audited financial statements in accordance with the PRC\naccounting standards, ensuring all the distributable profits of the VIE will be dispatched to the WFOE. The VIE may not assign any of its rights\nand obligations under the JiuGe Technology Consulting Services Agreement without prior written consent of the WFOE. This agreement ensures\nthat the WFOE and investors will be able to legally obtain the profits of the VIE, and transfer them to the WFOE more conveniently in the form of\n“service fee”;\n● a loan agreement through which JiuGe Management grants a loan to the Legal Representative of JiuGe Technology for the purpose of capital\ncontribution (the “JiuGe Technology Loan Agreement”). This agreement was duly signed between the WFOE and Ms. Li Li. Under this\nagreement, the WFOE loaned RMB 10,000,000 to Ms. Li Li, as the sole shareholder of the VIE, solely for the purpose of the capital contribution\nof the subscribed capital of the VIE. The loan amount has now been increased to RMB50,000,000. The WFOE has the right to convert the whole\nor any part of the outstanding principal amount into the equity interests in the VIE and may demand repayment of any or all of the principal\namount/ As security for performance and discharge of Ms. Li Li’s obligations under the JiuGe Technology Loan Agreement, Ms. Li Li pledged\n100% equity interests in the VIE, representing the entire registered capital of the VIE, by way of first-ranking security to the WFOE. This\nagreement could constrain Ms. Li Li to cooperate with WFOE’s instructions and avoid damaging the rights and interests of the WFOE and\ninvestors;\n● a power of attorney agreement under which the owner of JiuGe Technology has vested their collective voting control over JiuGe Technology to\nJiuGe Management and will only transfer their equity interests in JiuGe Technology to JiuGe Management or its designee(s) (the “JiuGe\nTechnology Power of Attorney Agreement”). The Power of Attorney Agreement was duly issued by Ms. Li Li to the WFOE. Under the JiuGe\nTechnology Power of Attorney Agreement, the WFOE is the exclusive agent who may exercise, at WFOE’s sole discretion, all the rights and\npowers in respect of all the 100% equity interests held by Ms. Li Li in the VIE on Ms. Li Li’s behalf, including without limitation to propose to\nconvene, attend and vote at the shareholder’s meeting of the VIE. Ms. Li Li cannot assign her rights and obligations under the JiuGe Technology\nPower of Attorney Agreement without prior written consent of the WFOE and the WFOE will bear its own costs, expenses and fees in connection\nwith performance of the JiuGe Technology Power of Attorney Agreement. This agreement ensures that the WFOE can replace Ms. LI Li in the\noperation and management of the VIE, and controlling its assets;\n30\n● a call option agreement under which the owner of JiuGe Technology has granted to JiuGe Management the irrevocable and unconditional right\nand option to acquire all of their equity interests in JiuGe Technology or transfer these rights to a third party (the “JiuGe Technology Call Option\nAgreement”). This agreement was duly signed by and among Ms. Li Li, the WFOE and the VIE. Under this agreement, the WFOE has an\nexclusive, irrevocable and unconditional option to purchase or to designate a third party to purchase 100% equity interests of the VIE at RMB one\n(1) yuan or the lowest amount of consideration permitted under the laws of PRC at any time, giving the WFOE a sole discretion to exercise such\noption at any time and in any manner as permitted by the laws of PRC. Pursuant to the JiuGe Technology Call Option Agreement, Ms. Li Li may\nnot, without prior written consent of the WFOE: (i) transfer or dispose of the equity interests in the VIE or the assets of the VIE in any manner; (ii)\ncreate any encumbrance of any kind over the equity interests in the VIE, other than the VIE Agreements; and (iii) resolve to or procure the VIE to:\n(a) change its registered capital; (b) amend its articles of association; (c) change any of its shareholders; (d) appoint, remove or replace its senior\nmanagement; (e) make or receive investment of any kind or merge or consolidate with any entity; (f) change information filed at the competent\nauthorities in the PRC; (g) make any lending or borrowing or provide security of any kind; (h) pay, make or declare any dividend, charge, fee or\nother distribution of any kind; (i) incure, create or permit to subsist or have any outstanding financial indebtedness; (j) enter into any agreements\nthat conflict with the JiuGe Technology Call Option Agreement; or (k) do any acts that would adversely impair the VIE’s ability to perform the\nobligations under the VIE Agreements. Neither Ms. Li Li nor the VIE may assign any of its rights and obligations under the agreement without the\nprior written consent of WFOE or unilaterally terminate the agreement. This agreement is one of the guarantees for WFOE and investors to ensure\nthat the VIE will not have any potential equity changes that endanger the rights and interests of WFOE and investors; and\n● a share pledge agreement under which the owner of JiuGe Technology has pledged all of their rights, titles and interests in JiuGe Technology to\nJiuGe Management to guarantee JiuGe Technology’s performance of its obligations under the JiuGe Technology Consulting Services Agreement\n(the “JiuGe Technology Share Pledge Agreement”). This agreement was duly signed among Ms. Li Li, the WFOE and the VIE. Under this\nagreement, all the equity interests of the VIE held by Ms. Li Li were pledged to the WFOE, giving the WFOE a right to exercise the share pledge\nwhere Ms. Li Li or the VIE violates the VIE Agreements. This measure under this agreement will result in the equity of the VIE being locked,\nmaking it impossible for any third party to legally obtain the equity of the VIE without the prior consent of the WFOE.\nOur PRC counsel has reviewed these agreements and believes that all the VIE Agreements were duly signed and are not in violation of applicable laws of\nPRC. We are of the opinion that the VIE Agreements are valid and giving the WFOE a full control over the VIE in respect of the current and effective PRC\nlaws and regulations. However, the VIE Agreements have never been challenged or recognized in court for the time being, and the PRC government may\ndetermine that the VIE Agreements are not in compliance with applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations compared with direct ownership, there may be\nless effective in controlling through the VIE structure.\nIn the first half of 2018, JiuGe Technology established contracts with China Unicom and China Mobile, initiating the provision of mobile data services to\nbusinesses and corporations in key provinces/municipalities including Chengdu, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Chongqing, Shanghai, Zhuhai, Zhejiang, Shaanxi and\nInner Mongolia. As with all dynamic markets, the specifics of our operational contracts have naturally evolved over time but our dedication to these\nprovinces is unwavering, and we consistently enhance our service and product offerings to ensure optimal service. Additionally, as we continue to grow,\nthere is the potential for our reach to expand into additional provinces in the PRC.\n31\nIn September 2018, JiuGe Technology launched and commercialized mobile payment and recharge services to businesses for China Unicom. The JiuGe\nTechnology mobile payment and recharge platform enables the seamless delivery of real-time payment and recharge services to third-party channels and\nbusinesses. We earn a negotiated rebate amount from each of China Unicom and China Mobile for all monies paid by consumers to China Unicom and\nChina Mobile that we process. To encourage consumers to utilize our portal instead of using our competitors’ platforms or paying China Unicom or China\nMobile directly, we offer mobile data and talk time at a rate discounted from these companies’ stated rates, which are also the rates we must pay to them to\npurchase the mobile data and talk time provided to consumers through the use of our platform. Accordingly, we earn income on the rebates we receive from\nthe telecommunications companies, reduced by the amounts by which we discount the mobile data and talk time sold through our platform.\nIn October 2018, China Unicom and China Mobile awarded JiuGe Technology with contracts that established partnerships for data analysis, that could\nunlock potential value-added services.\nThis description of the VIE Agreements discussed above do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the terms of the\nVIE Agreements, which were filed as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 27, 2018 and are incorporated by\nreference herein. The English translation version of the JiuGe Technology Share Pledge Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.6 to our Form S-1/A\n(Amendment No. 1) filed with the SEC on January 5, 2023, and is incorporated by reference herein.\nAcquisition of Beijing Technology\nOn March 7, 2019, the Company through JiuGe Technology acquired Beijing Technology, a company in the business of providing mass SMS text services\nto businesses looking to communicate with large numbers of their customers and prospective customers. Through Beijing Technology, the Company\nentered into the business of mass SMS text message service as a compliment to its mobile payment and recharge business. The mass SMS text message\nservice offers bulk SMS services to end consumers with competitive pricing. Currently, the Company’s SMS integrated platform is processing more than\n150 million SMS text messages per month. Beijing Technology retains a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (“MIIT”) to\noperate SMS and MMS business in the PRC. Similar to the mobile recharge business, Beijing Technology is required to make a deposit or bulk purchase in\nadvance and has secured business customers that will utilize Beijing Technology’s SMS integrated platform to send bulk SMS text messages monthly.\nBeijing Technology has the capability to manage and track the entire process, including to assist the Company’s clients to fulfil the government guidelines,\nuntil the SMS messages have been delivered successfully.\nChina Unicom Cooperation Agreement\nOn July 7, 2019, JiuGe Technology entered into that certain Yunnan Unicom Electronic Sales Platform Construction and Operation Cooperation Agreement\n(the “Cooperation Agreement”) with China United Network Communications Limited Yunnan Branch (“China Unicom Yunnan”). Under the\nCooperation Agreement, JiuGe Technology is responsible for constructing and operating China Unicom Yunnan’s electronic sales platform through which\nconsumers can purchase various goods and services from China Unicom Yunnan, including mobile telephones, mobile telephone service, broadband data\nservices, terminals, “smart” devices and related financial insurance. The Cooperation Agreement provides that JiuGe Technology is required to construct\nand operate the platform’s webpage in accordance with China Unicom Yunnan’s specifications and policies, and applicable law, and bear all expenses in\nconnection therewith. As consideration for the services it provides under the Cooperation Agreement, JiuGe Technology receives a percentage of the\nrevenue received from all sales it processes for China Unicom Yunnan on the platform.\nThe Cooperation Agreement expires three years from the date of its signature, subject to a yearly auto-renewal clause, which is currently in an auto-renewal\nperiod, but it may be terminated by (i) JiuGe Technology upon three months’ written notice or (ii) by China Unicom Yunnan unilaterally. The Cooperation\nAgreement contains customary representations from each party regarding such party’s authority to enter into and perform under the Cooperation\nAgreement, and provides customary events of default, including for various types of failure to perform. Any disputes arising between the parties under the\nCooperation Agreement will be adjudicated in Chinese courts.\n32\nThis description of the Cooperation Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Cooperation\nAgreement, which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2019 and is incorporated by reference\nherein.\nIn January 2022, Shanghai TengLian JiuJiu Information Communication Technology Co., Ltd. (“TengLian”) (a 99% owned subsidiary of Shanghai JiuGe\nInformation Technology Co., Ltd.) signed a co-operation agreement with China Unicom to launch the Device Protection program for mobile phones and\nthe new 5G phones.\nIntercorporate Relationships\nThe following is a list of all of our subsidiaries and the corresponding date of jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and the ownership interest of\neach entity.

We are also subject to the risks and uncertainties about any future actions of the Chinese government in this regard that could disallow the VIE\nstructure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and may cause the value of our Common Shares to depreciate significantly or\nbecome worthless.\nThe VIE Agreements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. For instance, the VIE and its shareholders could breach\ntheir contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are\ndetrimental to our interests. The shareholder of the VIE may not act in the best interests of our Company or may not perform their obligations under the\nVIE Agreements. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate certain portions of our business through the VIE Agreements with\nthe VIE. In the event that the VIE or its shareholder fail to perform their respective obligations under the VIE Agreements, we may have to incur\nsubstantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. In addition, even if legal actions are taken to enforce the VIE Agreements,\nthere is uncertainty as to whether Chinese courts would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil\nliability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the VIE Agreements”. We rely on the VIE\nAgreements with the VIE and its shareholder for a significant portion of our business operations. The VIE Agreements may not be as effective as direct\nownership in providing operational control. Any failure by the VIE or its shareholder to perform their obligations under such contractual arrangements\nwould have a material and adverse effect on our business.\n33\nAs of the date of this periodic report on Form 10-Q, we and the VIE are not required to seek permissions from the CSRC, the CAC, or any other entity that\nis required to approve of the operations of the VIE, other than a value-added telecommunications business licence, which has already been obtained.\nNevertheless, Chinese regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws, regulations or implement rules that require us, our subsidiaries or the VIEs\nto obtain permissions from such regulatory authorities to approve the operations of the VIE or any securities listing.\nOverview\nThe Company is a mobile data specialist company incorporated in Delaware, USA, with its head office located at 111 Somerset Road, Level 3, Singapore\n238164. The Company operates the following lines of business: (i) Telecommunications Products and Services; (ii) Value Added Products and Services (iii)\nShort Message Services (“SMS”) and Multimedia Messaging Services (“MMS”); (iv) a Rich Communication Services (“RCS”) platform; (v) Big Data\nInsights; and (vi) a Video Games Division (inactive).\nTelecommunications Products and Services\nThe Company’s current product mix consisting of payment and recharge services, data plans, subscription plans, mobile phones, loyalty points redemption\nand other products bundles (i.e. mobile protection plans). Chinese mobile phone consumers often utilize third-party e-marketing websites to pay their\nphone bills. If the consumer connected directly to the telecommunications provider to pay his or her bill, the consumer would miss out on any benefits or\nmarketing discounts that e-marketers provide. Thus, consumers log on to these e-marketer’s websites, click into their respective phone provider’s store, and\n“top up,” or pay, their telecommunications provider for additional mobile data and talk time.\nTo connect to the respective mobile telecommunications providers, these e-marketers must utilize a portal licensed by the applicable telecommunication\ncompany that processes the payment. We have been granted one of these licenses by China United Network Communications Group Co., Ltd. (“China\nUnicom”) and China Mobile Communications Corporation (“China Mobile”), each of which is a major telecommunications provider in China. We\nprincipally earn revenue by providing mobile payment and recharge services to customers of China Unicom and China Mobile.\nWe conduct our mobile payment business through JiuGe Technology, our contractually controlled affiliate through the entry into the VIE Agreements in\nOctober 2018. In the first half of 2018, JiuGe Technology secured contracts with China Unicom and China Mobile to distribute mobile data for businesses\nand corporations in nine provinces/municipalities, namely Chengdu, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Chongqing, Shanghai, Zhuhai, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia,\nHenan and Fujian. In September 2018, JiuGe Technology launched and commercialized mobile payment and recharge services to businesses for China\nUnicom. In May 2021, JiuGe Technology signed a volume-based agreement with China Mobile Fujian to offer recharge services to the Fujian province\nwhich we have launched and commercialized in November 2021.\nThe JiuGe Technology mobile payment and recharge platform enables the seamless delivery of real-time payment and recharge services to third-party\nchannels and businesses. We earn a rebate from each telecommunications company on the funds paid by consumers to the telecommunications companies\nwe process. To encourage consumers to utilize our portal instead of using our competitors’ platforms or paying China Unicom or China Mobile directly, we\noffer mobile data and talk time at a rate discounted from these companies’ stated rates, which are also the rates we must pay to them to purchase the mobile\ndata and talk time provided to consumers through the use of our platform. Accordingly, we earn income on the rebates we receive from China Unicom and\nChina Mobile, reduced by the amounts by which we discount the mobile data and talk time sold through our platform.\n34\nFingerMotion started and commercialized its “Business to Business” (“B2B”) model by integrating with various e-commerce platforms to provide its\nmobile payment and recharge services to subscribers or end consumers. In the first quarter of 2019 FingerMotion expanded its business by commercializing\nits first “Business to Consumer” (“B2C”) model, offering the telecommunication providers’ products and services, including data plans, subscription plans,\nmobile phones, and loyalty points redemption, directly to subscribers or customers of the e-commerce companies, such as PinDuoDuo (“PDD”), TMall\n(“TMALL”) and JD.Com. The Company is planning to further expand its universal exchange platform by setting up B2C stores on several other major e-\ncommerce platforms in China. In addition to that, we have been assigned as one of China’s Mobile’s loyalty redemption partner where we will be providing\nthe services for their customers via our platform.\nAdditionally, as previously disclosed, on July 7, 2019, JiuGe Technology, our contractually controlled affiliate, entered into that certain Cooperation\nAgreement with China Unicom Yunnan, whereby JiuGe Technology is responsible for constructing and operating China Unicom’s electronic sales platform\nthrough which consumers can purchase various goods and services from China Unicom, including mobile telephones, mobile telephone service, broadband\ndata services, terminals, “smart” devices and related financial insurance. The Cooperation Agreement provides that JiuGe Technology is required to\nconstruct and operate the platform’s webpage in accordance with China Unicom’s specifications and policies, and applicable law, and bear all expenses in\nconnection therewith. As consideration for the service JiuGe Technology provides under the Cooperation Agreement, it receives a percentage of the\nrevenue received from all sales it processes for China Unicom on the platform. The Cooperation Agreement expires three years from the date of its\nsignature with a yearly auto-renewal clause, which is currently in an auto-renewal period, but it may be terminated by (i) JiuGe Technology upon three\nmonths’ written notice or (ii) by China Unicom unilaterally.\nDuring the recent fiscal year, the Company expanded its offering under their telecommunication product and services by increasing their product line\nrevenue streams. In March 2020, FingerMotion secured a contract with both China Mobile and China Unicom to acquire new users to take up the\nrespective subscription plans.\nIn February 2021, we increased the mobile phones sales to end users using all of our platforms. This business will continue to contribute to the overall\nrevenue for the group as part of our offering to our customers.\nValue Added Product and Services\nThese are new product and services that the Company expects to secure and work with the telecommunication provider and all our e-commerce platform\npartners to market. In February 2022, our contractually controlled subsidiary, JiuGe Technology, through its 99% own subsidiary TengLian signed an\nagreement with both China Unicom and China Mobile to co-operate to roll out the Mobile Device Protection product which is incorporated into the\nTelecommunication subscription plans in line with their roll out of new mobile phones and new 5G phones. In mid-July 2022, we launched the roll out of\nthe Mobile Device protection product with the roll out of the new mobile phones and 5G phones. Complementing our hardware protection services, we\nhave introduced cloud services designed to offer corporate customers robust data storage, processing capabilities, and databases accessible via the internet.\nSMS and MMS Services\nOn March 7, 2019, the Company through JiuGe Technology acquired Beijing Technology Co, a company in the business of providing mass SMS text\nservices to businesses looking to communicate with large numbers of their customers and prospective customers. With this acquisition, the Company\nexpanded into a second partnership with the telecom companies by acquiring bulk SMS and MMS bundles at reduced prices and offering bulk SMS\nservices to end consumers with competitive pricing. Beijing Technology retains a license from MIIT to operate the SMS and MMS business in the PRC.\nSimilar to the mobile payment and recharge business, Beijing Technology is required to make a deposit or bulk purchase in advance and has secured\nbusiness customers, including premium car manufacturers, hotel chains, airlines and e-commerce companies, that utilize Beijing Technology’s SMS\nintegrated platform to send bulk SMS text messages monthly. Beijing Technology has the capability to manage and track the entire process, including\nguiding the Company’s customer to meet MIIT’s guidelines on messages composed, until the SMS messages have been delivered successfully.\n35\nRich Communication Services\nIn March 2020, the Company began the development of an RCS platform, also known as Messaging as a Platform (“MaaP”). This RCS platform will be a\nproprietary business messaging platform that enables businesses and brands to communicate and service their customers on the 5G infrastructure,\ndelivering a better and more efficient user experience at a lower cost. For example, with the new 5G RCS message service, consumers will have the ability\nto list available flights by sending a message regarding a holiday and will also be able to book and buy flights by sending messages. This will allow\ntelecommunication providers like China Unicom and China Mobile to retain users on their systems without having to utilize third-party apps or log onto the\nInternet, which will increase their user retention. We expect this to open up a new marketing channel for the Company’s current and prospective business\npartners. Currently, the deployment of this RCS platform is under review, with discussion ongoing among government bodies, major service providers, and\ntelecommunication companies. These deliberations aim to assess the potential market impacts and establish the necessary consents before the launch,\nconsidering the significant changes the platform may introduce to user interactions with existing services. These discussions seek to ensure that all\nstakeholders’ concerns are addressed comprehensively. Once these issues are resolved and the necessary approval is obtained, we anticipate a substantial\nenhancement in our service offerings and an expansion of our market reach.\nBig Data Insights\nIn July 2020, the Company launched its proprietary technology platform “Sapientus” as its big data insights arm to deliver data-driven solutions and\ninsights for businesses within the insurance, healthcare, and financial services industries. The Company applies its vast experience in the insurance and\nfinancial services industry and capabilities in technology and data analytics to develop revolutionary solutions targeted towards insurance and financial\nconsumers.

Advances in\ntechnology and streaming now allow users to download games rather than visiting retailers. Video game publishers are expanding their direct-to-consumer\nchannels with mobile gaming, the current growth leader, and eSports and virtual reality gaining momentum as the Company’s Board of Directors decided\nto re-focus the Company’s resources into new business opportunities in China, particularly the mobile phone payment and data business.\n36\nRecent Developments\nOn July 9, 2024, our contractual controlled subsidiary, JiuGe Technology, embarked on the development of crisis and emergency response solutions. These\nsolutions are designed to facilitate collaboration with dispatchers, first responders, and healthcare agencies during emergency situations in China. JiuGe\nTechnology has received its first order for its Advance Mobile Integrated Command and Communication Platform (“C2 Platform”), to be installed in all\nvehicles and apparatuses involved in the country’s civil emergency crisis program.\nOn August 19, 2024, we announced that JiuGe Technology’s Advance Mobile Integrated C2 Platform, to be integrated into Maxus vehicles produced by\nSAIC Motor Corporation Limited, has officially received national certification from China’s MIIT. This marks the first certification of its kind, aimed to\nexpedite the deployment of the emergency response vehicles across China. This certification validates the platform’s quality, reliability, and advanced\ntechnological features, enabling us to commence the assembly and rollout of vehicles equipped with our platform and technology.\nOn September 10, 2024, we appointed CT International LLP as our new independent registered public accounting firm, succeeding our previous auditors,\nCenturion ZD CPA & Co.\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended August 31, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended August 31, 2023\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods indicated:\nFor the three months ended\nAugust 31, 2024 August 31, 2023\nRevenue $ 8,458,763 $ 9,279,166\nCost of revenue $ (8,157,735) $ (7,437,632)\nTotal operating expenses $ (1,992,194) $ (2,041,838)\nTotal other income (expenses) $ 615 $ 65,652\nNet loss attributable to the Company’s shareholders $ (1,688,229) $ (134,081)\nForeign currency translation adjustment $ 240,216 $ (937,542)\nComprehensive loss attributable to the Company $ (1,448,196) $ (1,071,427)\nBasic Loss Per Share attributable to the Company $ (0.03) $ 0.00\nDiluted Loss Per Share attributable to the Company $ (0.03) $ 0.00\nRevenue\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s revenue from its three lines of business for the periods indicated:\nFor the three months ended\nAugust 31, 2024 August 31, 2023 Change (%)\nTelecommunication Products & Services $ 8,426,263 $ 9,194,228 -8%\nSMS & MMS Business $ 3,770 $ 8,192 -54%\nCommand & Communication $ 28,730 $ — 100%\nBig Data $ — $ 76,746 -100%\nTotal Revenue $ 8,458,763 $ 9,279,166 -9%\nWe recorded $8,458,763 in revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2024, a decrease of $820,403 or 9%, compared to the three months ended\nAugust 31, 2023.

The significant decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the higher margins realized from the Cloud business segment under the\nTelecommunication Product & Services during the prior period. In contrast, the current period’s product mix resulted in a lower gross profit generated from\nrecharge services revenue.\nAmortization & Depreciation\nWe recorded depreciation of $11,740 for fixed assets for the three months ended August 31, 2024, a decrease of $5,931 or 34%, compared to the three\nmonths ended August 31, 2023.\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated:\n38\nFor the three months ended\nAugust 31, 2024 August 31, 2023\nAccounting $ 35,629 $ 37,213\nConsulting $ 361,628 $ 448,853\nEntertainment $ 59,777 $ 76,673\nIT $ 22,013 $ 15,283\nRent $ 33,744 $ 35,150\nSalaries & Wages $ 616,947 $ 478,293\nTechnical Fee $ 34,895 $ 34,976\nTravelling $ 81,619 $ 63,192\nOthers $ 301,784 $ 444,723\nTotal G&A Expenses $ 1,548,036 $ 1,634,356\nWe recorded $1,548,036 in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024, a decrease of $86,320 or 5%, compared to the\nthree months ended August 31, 2023.

The increase of $3,317 or 2% was due to the data access and usage fee charged by telecommunications companies.\nOur Insurtech division focuses on consumer behavioral insights extraction for the purpose of risk assessment. Insights are mined from a multitude of data\nsources, harmonized with the objectives of our various business partners. The initial phase of business application is to focus on the insurance industry,\nparticularly in the area of underwriting risk rating, complementary claims adjudication and assessment, and risk segmentation & market penetration.\nThis division comprises of experienced actuaries, data scientists, and computer programmers.\nThe expenses for research & development include associated wages and salaries, data access fees and IT infrastructure.\nOver the course of 2023, Sapientus has made great strides on several fronts: market implementation, analytical advancement, and network engagement.\nThese developments proceed in parallel with continued efforts to enrich our portfolio line-up towards fulfilling our commercialization potential and value\ncreation objectives:\n39\n● Deployment of an analytic engine within the leading reinsurer’s risk assessment and selection system.\n- Our rating models have been onboarded onto our partner’s innovative digital solutions platform as an embedded component of their\nunderwriting engine.

The increase of $26,145 or 17% was due to the\nengagement of consultants to the Company that were compensated with shares of our common stock. The rationale for compensating these consultants and\nadvisors with shares is to minimize the usage of cash by the Company to allow the Company to use the cash to invest in revenue-generating activities.\n40\nOperating Expenses\nWe recorded $1,992,194 in operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to $2,041,838 in operating expenses for the three\nmonths ended August 31, 2023.

This decrease resulted from increases in revenue of $8,151,251 and $28,730 from our SMS & MMS and Command & Communication\nbusinesses, respectively, offset by decreases in revenue of $12,569,040 and $226,452 from our Telecommunication Products & Services and Big Data\nbusinesses, respectively. We principally earn revenue by providing mobile payment and recharge services to customers of telecommunications companies\nin China. Specifically, we earn a negotiated rebate amount from the telecommunications companies for all monies paid by consumers to those companies\nthat we process. For the three months ended August 31, 2024, our SMS & MMS business saw a significant revenue increase compensating for a shortfall\nfrom the recharge services. The Company is constantly reallocating its resources when needed, reflecting our focus on optimizing our business portfolio by\nprioritizing higher-margin segments, which during the six months ended August 31, 2024, resulted in a corresponding decrease in revenue from our\nTelecommunication Products & Services. However, this shift could not compensate for the higher revenue generated from recharge services in the previous\nsix months ended August 31, 2023. In shifting focus to our Big Data business, since FY2021, we forged an alliance and collaborative partnerships with two\nkey reinsurance companies, Pacific Life Re and Munich Re, which enabled us to develop a holistic multi-faceted risk rating concept, leveraging the\nCompany’s proprietary approach to analytics by drawing data from novel sources and filtering them through advance algorithms with the ultimate goal to\napply new insights generated from our predictive model to the traditional insurance industry and extending behavioral analytics to enhance understanding\nof morbidity and behavioral patterns in the Chinese market.

As part of our new business and partner acquisition\nstrategy, we have been actively developing and promoting new value propositions, such as offering proprietary analytic tools and insights that\nfacilitate more effective sales profiling and creative product innovations, capturing a wider commercial audience.\n● Official patent recognition – Over the past four years, Sapientus has been granted eight patents by the National Copyright Administration of\nChina (NCAC) for the abovementioned model algorithms and technological infrastructure as well as insurance-oriented applications, for\nexample, Risk Rating API Design, and Insurance Risk Assessment platform and Insurance Fraud Detection System. NCAC is the governing body\nfor patent and copyright verification and approval in China. The Company’s successful applications for these patents validate Sapientus’\ncontinuing innovation in data science and its application in the field of insurance, finance, and beyond, demonstrating the Company’s active\nparticipation and contributions to the industry.\nIt is important to emphasize that our allocation to research and development is foundational to our technology-oriented operations. Our steadfast dedication\nto innovation remains undiminished, and we expect to persistently advance in our developmental endeavors to reinforce our technological edge.\nShare Compensation Expenses\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s share compensation expenses for the periods indicated:\nFor the six months ended\nAugust 31, 2024 August 31, 2023\nShare compensation expenses $ 403,233 $ 450,879\nWe incurred fees of $403,233 in share issuance for consultants in consideration of the services which have been provided to the company for the six months\nended August 31, 2024, as compared to $450,879 for the six months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease of $47,646 or 11% was due to the reduced\nengagement of consultants to the Company that were compensated with shares of our common stock. The rationale for rewarding these consultants and\nadvisors with shares is to minimize the usage of cash by the Company to allow the Company to use the cash to invest in revenue-generating activities.\nOperating Expenses\nWe recorded $4,350,172 in operating expenses for the six months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to $3,883,889 in operating expenses for the six\nmonths ended August 31, 2023. The increase of $466,283 or 12%, for the six months ended August 31, 2024, is as set forth above.\nNet Loss attributable to the Company’s shareholders\nThe net loss attributable to the Company’s shareholders was $3,344,133 for the six months ended August 31, 2024, and $1,399,552 for the six months\nended August 31, 2023. The increase in net loss attributable to the Company’s shareholders of $1,944,581 or 139% resulted primarily from the reduced\nrevenue and gross profit as discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets out our cash and working capital as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024:\n44\nAs at August 31, As at February 29,\n2024 2024\nCash and cash equivalents $ 810,284 $ 1,517,232\nWorking capital $ 9,708,861 $ 11,971,003\nAt August 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $810,284, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $1,517,232 at February 29, 2024. Our\nmobile payment business model necessitates periodic fund deposits with our telecommunication companies to obtain access to the mobile data and talk\ntime we make available to consumers on our portal. Additionally, our expansion into the cloud-based business, which features a longer collection cycle, has\nled to an increase in accounts receivable and consequently, a greater strain on our liquidity. To manage these operational demands effectively, we have had\nto carefully monitor and manage our cash flows. We believe that our cash on hand and cash equivalents, along with our revenues from operations, will fund\nour core operations and repay our outstanding indebtedness for at least the next 12 months. However, we anticipate the need for additional capital to\nsupport the rollout of our Command & Communication business as well for more continued growth, increasing our deposits with telecommunication\nentities will be crucial. To support all these, we intend to continue to seek additional capital through public or private sales of our equity or debt securities,\nor both. We may also explore entering into financing arrangements with commercial banks or non-traditional lenders. We cannot provide investors with any\nassurance that we will be able to raise additional funding from the sale of our equity or debt securities, or both, in order to support the rollout of our\nCommand & Communication business and increase our deposits with our telecommunications company clients, or if available, that such funding will be on\nterms acceptable to us.\nWe did, however, as of August 31, 2024, receive $1,605,000 in subscription proceeds to purchase 1,070,000 shares of our common stock at $1.50 per share\non a private placement basis. When we issue the shares pursuant to the subscription agreements, we intend to rely upon the exemption from the registration\nrequirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”) provided by Rule 903 of Regulation S promulgated under the U.S.\nSecurities Act.\nStatement of Cashflows\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flows for the periods presented:\nFor the six months ended\nAugust 31, 2024 August 31, 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (2,904,172) $ (4,874,162)\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (1,741) $ (372)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 2,629,688 $ (295,333)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash & cash equivalents $ (430,723) $ (27,095)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (706,948) $ (5,196,962)\nCash Flow used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased by $1,969,990 in the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023,\nprimarily due to an increase in account receivable of ($12,209,223) (August 31, 2023: ($7,292,931)) and increase in prepayment and deposit of ($22,226)\n(August 31, 2023: $329,727); offset by decrease in other receivable of $527,972 (August 31, 2023: ($2,067,397)), increase in accounts payable of\n$10,002,702 (August 31, 2023: $5,327,561), increase in accrual and other payable of $1,369,869 (August 31, 2023: ($434,852)) and increase in lease\nliability of $11,448 (August 31, 2023: ($2,673)).\n45\nCash Flow used in Investing Activities\nDuring the six months ended August 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities increased by $1,369 compared to $372 in the six months ended August\n31, 2023.\nCash Flow provided by Financing Activities\nDuring the six months ended August 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $2,629,688 compared to net cash used by financing activities\nduring the six months ended August 31, 2023 of $295,333. The increase was due to the receipt of subscription proceeds to purchase 1,070,000 shares of our\ncommon stock at $1.50 per share on a private placement basis and short-term loan facility of SGD$1,370,000.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in\nfinancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nSubsequent Events\nOn September 4, 2024, the remaining SGD$500,000 of the SGD$1,500,000 Loan has been fully drawn upon by our wholly owned subsidiary, Finger\nMotion Company Limited.\nOn October 11, 2024, we issued 1,095,000 shares of common stock to 15 individuals due to the closing of our private placement at $1.50 per share for\ngross proceeds of $1,642,500. In connection with the closing of the private placement, we paid cash finder’s fees of an aggregate of $158,000 to three\nindividuals.\nOther than the above, we have determined that we do not have any material subsequent events to report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nFor a complete summary of all our significant accounting policies refer to Note 2 - Summary of Principal Accounting Policies of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements as presented under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our\nfiscal year ended February 29, 2024 filed with the SEC on May 29, 2024.\nRefer to “Critical Accounting Policies” under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended February 29, 2024 filed with the SEC on May 29, 2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company does not believe recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the\nconsolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.\n46\nITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this\nitem.\nITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual\nReport. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated\nand communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible\ncontrols and procedures.\nBased on such evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, as discussed in more detail below, our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of August 31, 2024. Management has continued to monitor the implementation of the remediation\nplan described below.\nManagement’s quarterly report on internal control over financial reporting\nManagement of FingerMotion, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is\ndefined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) is designed under the\nsupervision of our Chief Executive Officer, acting in the capacity of principal executive officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, acting in the capacity of\nprincipal financial officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or\nGAAP. The Company’s ICFR includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems\ndetermined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree\nof compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, including our principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nAugust 31, 2024 in accordance with the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”).\n47\nBased on this assessment, Management concluded that certain aspects of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024,\nwere not effective.\nA material weakness, as defined in standards established pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal\ncontrols over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement for our annual or interim consolidated financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weakness, which also existed as of February 29, 2024:\n· We have limited segregation of duties and oversight of work performed as well as lack of compensating controls in the Company’s finance and\naccounting functions due to limited personnel. As a result, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be\neconomically feasible. Furthermore, we cannot provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance\nwith management and director authorization. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording\nof transactions should be performed by separate individuals.\nManagement’s Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses:\nManagement has taken significant steps towards remediation of these material weaknesses in 2023 and has been implementing and continues to implement\nmeasures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed,\nimplemented, validated, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include:\n· Management has documented a complete set of controls incorporating segregation of duties, separate individuals performing and reviewing\ncontrols, and proper authorization and segregation of duties around payments and expenditures in 2023. Management has implemented most of\nthese controls in calendar year 2023 and will complete implementation in calendar year 2024.\n· Management has implemented corporate governance policies and charters that will further align the Company’s governance procedures with the\nrequirements noted in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including a Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics, which reflects the overall corporate principles,\npolicies and values that provides overall guidance for our control procedures.\nNotwithstanding the assessment that our ICFR was not effective as of August 31, 2024 and that there is a material weaknesses as identified herein, we\nbelieve that our consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash\nflows for the period covered thereby in all material respects. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and we are\nundertaking measures to remediate the material weakness we have identified and generally strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. We will\nalso continue to further review, optimize, and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. This material weakness will not be considered\nremediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these\ncontrols are operating effectively.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nExcept for the remediation procedures being implemented by the Company as described above, there have been no other changes in our internal control\nover financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended August 31,\n2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n48\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe Company is not a party to any pending legal proceeding. We are not aware of any pending legal proceeding to which any of our officers, directors,\naffiliates or any beneficial holders of 5% or more of our voting securities are adverse to us or have a material interest adverse to us.\nITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024, and this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q, we have identified the following material risks and uncertainties which reflect our outlook and conditions known to us as of the date of this\nQuarterly Report. These material risks and uncertainties should be carefully reviewed by our stockholders and any potential investors in evaluating the\nCompany, our business and the market value of our common stock. Furthermore, any one of these material risks and uncertainties has the potential to\ncause actual results, performance, achievements or events to be materially different from any future results, performance, achievements or events\nimplied, suggested or expressed by any forward-looking statements made by us or by persons acting on our behalf. Refer to “Cautionary Note\nRegarding Forward-looking Statements” as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024.\nThere is no assurance that we will be successful in preventing the material adverse effects that any one or more of the following material risks and\nuncertainties may cause on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, which may result in a significant decrease in the market\nprice of our common stock. Furthermore, there is no assurance that these material risks and uncertainties represent a complete list of the material risks\nand uncertainties facing us. There may be additional risks and uncertainties of a material nature that, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are\nunaware of or that we consider immaterial that may become material in the future, any one or more of which may result in a material adverse effect on\nus. You could lose all or a significant portion of your investment due to any one of these material risks and uncertainties.\nRisks Related to the Business\nWe have a limited operating history and, as a result, our past results may not be indicative of future operating performance.\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. You should not rely on our past results of operations as\nindicators of future performance. You should consider and evaluate our prospects in light of the risks and uncertainty frequently encountered by companies\nlike ours.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical financial data and operate in an evolving\nmarket, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in\na more predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing\ncompanies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or\nchange, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nFor all annual periods of our operating history we have experienced net losses. We generated a net loss of approximately $3.3 million during the six-month\nperiod ended August 31, 2024 and net losses of approximately $3.8 million, $7.5 million and $4.9 million for the years ended February 29, 2024, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. At August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $31.8 million and $28.4 million,\nrespectively. We have not achieved profitability, and we may not realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability in future periods. Our expenses will\nlikely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform features, expand in existing and new markets, increase our sales and\nmarketing efforts and continue to invest in our platform. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or\ngrowth in our business. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses in the\nfuture and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\n49\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are currently experiencing growth in our business. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place,\nstrain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions.\nOur ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to\ncontinue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage employees. Continued growth\ncould strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit,\ntrain and retain highly skilled personnel and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and\noperations, the quality of our offerings could suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe depend on our key personnel and other highly skilled personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain, motivate or integrate our personnel, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel\nand on our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. We may not be\nsuccessful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to fulfil our current or future needs. Our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring\nmembers of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive\nterms or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic\ngoals.\nOur concentration of earnings from two telecommunications companies may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe currently derive a substantial amount of our total revenue through contracts secured with China Unicom and China Mobile. If we were to lose the\nbusiness of one or both of these mobile telecommunications companies, if either were to fail to fulfil its obligations to us, if either were to experience\ndifficulty in paying rebates to us on a timely basis, if either negotiated lower pricing terms, or if either increased the number of licensed payment portals it\npermits to process its payments, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that the volume of revenue we earn from China Unicom and China Mobile will remain consistent going\nforward. Any substantial change in our relationships with either China Unicom or China Mobile, or both, whether due to actions by our competitors,\nregulatory authorities, industry factors or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny actual or perceived security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our brand and adversely affect our reputation, brand, business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves the processing and transmission of our users’ personal and other sensitive data. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized\naccess to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent\nthese attacks. Unauthorized parties may in the future gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including gaining unauthorized access\ninto our systems or facilities or those of our service providers, partners or users on our platform, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees,\nservice providers, partners, users or others into disclosing names, passwords, payment information or other sensitive information, which may in turn be\nused to access our information technology systems, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or others into manipulating payment\ninformation, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to criminal actors. In addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their own\nmobile devices that are entirely unrelated to our systems and platform but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches\nexperienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are becoming increasingly common and\nsophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored or supported\nby significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect.\n50\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our users’ data, prevent data loss and prevent other security breaches, these\nsecurity measures cannot guarantee security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches; also,\nemployee error, malfeasance or other errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in an actual or perceived privacy or\nsecurity breach or other security incident.\nAny actual or perceived breach of privacy or security could interrupt our operations, result in our platform being unavailable, result in loss or improper\ndisclosure of data, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation and brand, damage our relationships with third-party partners, result in\nsignificant legal, regulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. Any breach of privacy or security impacting any entities with which we share or disclose data\n(including, for example, our third-party providers) could have similar effects.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, could be costly and divert\nmanagement’s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred,\nthat insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future\nclaim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our\ninsurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our platform or offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or\nmalfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses,\ndisruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware or other events.\nOur systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, theft and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems are\nnot fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient\nto cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have not experienced any system failures or other events or conditions that have interrupted the availability or reduced or effected the speed or\nfunctionality of our offerings. These events, were they to occur in the future, could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under\nour control.\nOur business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet\ninfrastructure or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our services and offerings could\ninterfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not\nload as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors’\nproducts or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications operators. If\nmobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly\ndecrease.\n51\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as\na power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our services, offerings and\nplatform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed\nservices, and local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt\nour operations, and subject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We have invested significant\nresources to develop new products to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in\nterritories where mobile communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.\nWe may be subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings as our business grows\nand as we deploy new offerings, including proceedings related to our products or our acquisitions, securities issuances or business practices. The results of\nany such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations or other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty.\nAny claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\nmanagement attention and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for litigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant\nsubjective judgment and speculation. It is possible that such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and penalties that could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These proceedings could also result in harm to our reputation and brand,\nsanctions, consent decrees, injunctions or other orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations to\nindemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and current and former directors and officers.\nWe will require additional funding to support our business growth.\nTo grow our business, FingerMotion currently looks to take advantage of the immense growth in the total variety of mobile services provided in China. On\nFebruary 1, 2022, the Xinhua News Agency reported that the combined business revenue in the telecom sector rose 8% year on year to about USD232.43\nbillion in 2021, with the growth rate up 4.1 percentage points from 2020, according to the PRC Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. For the\nCompany to continue to grow, the deposit with the Telecoms needs to increase, as most of the revenue we process is dependent on the size of the deposit\nwe have with each Telecom. We will need to raise additional capital to materially increase the amounts of these deposits with the Telecoms and to support\nthe rollour of our Command & Communications business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those\nsecurities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Any debt\nfinancing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters,\nwhich may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. We cannot be certain that additional funding will\nbe available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate funding or funding on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our\nability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\nClaims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of\nintellectual property rights. In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they\nown, have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we gain a public profile and the number of competitors in our market increases, the possibility of\nintellectual property rights claims against us grows. From time to time, third parties may assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against\nus. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent-holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to assert\ntheir intellectual property rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending\nagainst the claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of\nthe substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during\nthis type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us,\nwe may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us from using or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement\nthat prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n52\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights,\nwhich may not be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be\nnon-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third party does not offer us a license to its\nintellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant\ntime (during which we would be unable to continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these\nevents could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur stock has limited liquidity.\nOur common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on December 28, 2021, and before that it traded on the OTCQX operated by OTC Markets\nGroup Inc. Trading volume in our shares may be sporadic and the price could experience volatility. If adverse market conditions exist, you may have\ndifficulty selling your shares.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the\nfollowing:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n● changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates;\n● changes in market valuations of other companies, particularly those that market services such as ours;\n● announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n● introduction of product enhancements that reduce the need for our products;\n● departure of key personnel; and\n● changes in overall global market sentiments and economy trends\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and\nexpansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales\nof their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\n53\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market price and\ntrading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business,\nour market or our competition. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If one\nor more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors or publish inaccurate\nor unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or\nmore of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price\nand trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nThe continued sale of our equity securities will dilute the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders and may decrease the market price for our\nCommon Shares.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of up to 200,000,000 Common Shares and up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock\n(“Preferred Shares”). Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our capital stock to provide additional financing in the future\nand designate the rights of the preferred shares, which may include voting, dividend, distribution or other rights that are preferential to those held by the\ncommon stockholders. The issuance of any such common or preferred shares may result in a reduction of the book value or market price of our outstanding\ncommon shares. To grow our business substantially, we will likely have to issue additional equity securities to obtain working capital to deposit with the\ntelecommunications companies for which we process mobile recharge payments. Our efforts to fund our intended business plans will therefore result in\ndilution to our existing stockholders. If we do issue any such additional common shares, such issuance also will cause a reduction in the proportionate\nownership and voting power of all other stockholders. As a result of such dilution, if you acquire common shares your proportionate ownership interest and\nvoting power could be decreased. Furthermore, any such issuances could result in a change of control or a reduction in the market price for our common\nshares.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate\nfinancial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “SOA”). The SOA\nrequires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing\nto develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports\nthat we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that\ninformation required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers.\nWe are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend,\nsignificant resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial\nreporting.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business. Further,\nweaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain\neffective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet\nour reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective\ninternal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered\npublic accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to\ninclude in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting\ncould also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely adversely affect the market price of our\ncommon stock.\n54\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our shares of\ncommon stock, which could depress the price of our shares of common stock.\nFINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that\ninvestment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make\nreasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretations\nof these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, if\nour shares of common stock become speculative low-priced securities, the FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend\nthat their customers buy our shares of common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares of common stock, have an adverse effect on\nthe market for our shares of common stock, and thereby depress our price per share of common stock.\nOur shares of common stock have been thinly traded, and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares of\ncommon stock to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nUntil December 28, 2021, our shares of common stock were quoted on the OTCQB/QX where they were “thinly-traded”, meaning that the number of\npersons interested in purchasing our shares of common stock at or near bid prices at any given time was relatively small or non-existent. Since we listed on\nNasdaq on December 28, 2021, the volume of our shares of common stock traded has increased, but that volume could decrease until we are thinly-traded\nagain. That could occur due to a number of factors, including that we are relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and\nothers in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-\naverse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares of common stock until\nsuch time as we became more seasoned. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares of common\nstock is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support\ncontinuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our shares of common stock may not develop or be\nsustained.\nRisks Related to the VIE Agreements\nThe PRC government may determine that the VIE Agreements are not in compliance with applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations.\nJiuGe Management manages and operates the mobile data business through JiuGe Technology pursuant to the rights its holds under the VIE Agreements.\nAlmost all economic benefits and risks arising from JiuGe Technology’s operations are transferred to JiuGe Management under these agreements.\nThere are risks involved with the operation of our business in reliance on the VIE Agreements, including the risk that the VIE Agreements may be\ndetermined by PRC regulators or courts to be unenforceable. Our PRC counsel has advised us that the VIE Agreements are binding and enforceable under\nPRC law, but has further advised that if the VIE Agreements were for any reason determined to be in breach of any existing or future PRC laws or\nregulations, the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such breach, including:\n● imposing economic penalties;\n● discontinuing or restricting the operations of JiuGe Technology or JiuGe Management;\n● imposing conditions or requirements in respect of the VIE Agreements with which JiuGe Technology or JiuGe Management may not be able to\ncomply;\n● requiring our company to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations;\n55\n● taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could adversely affect our company’s business; and\n● revoking the business licenses and/or the licenses or certificates of JiuGe Management, and/or voiding the VIE Agreements.\nAny of these actions could adversely affect our ability to manage, operate and gain the financial benefits of JiuGe Technology, which would have a material\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if the PRC government determines that the contractual\narrangements constituting part of our VIE structure do not comply with PRC regulations, or if regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future,\nwe may be unable to assert our contractual rights over the assets of our VIE, and our Common Shares may decline in value or become worthless.\nOur ability to manage and operate JiuGe Technology under the VIE Agreements may not be as effective as direct ownership.\nWe conduct our mobile data business in the PRC and generate virtually all of our revenues through the VIE Agreements. Our plans for future growth are\nbased substantially on growing the operations of JiuGe Technology. However, the VIE Agreements may not be as effective in providing us with control\nover JiuGe Technology as direct ownership. Under the current VIE arrangements, as a legal matter, if JiuGe Technology fails to perform its obligations\nunder these contractual arrangements, we may have to (i) incur substantial costs and resources to enforce such arrangements, and (ii) rely on legal remedies\nunder PRC law, which we cannot be sure would be effective. Therefore, if we are unable to effectively control JiuGe Technology, it may have an adverse\neffect on our ability to achieve our business objectives and grow our revenues.\nThe VIE Agreements have never been challenged or recognized in court for the time being, the PRC government may determine that the VIE\nAgreements are not in compliance with applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations.\nThe VIE Agreements are governed by the PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitral proceedings pursuant to PRC law. If JiuGe\nTechnology or its shareholders fail to perform the obligations under the VIE Agreements, we would be required to resort to legal remedies available under\nPRC law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, or claiming damages. We cannot be sure that such remedies would provide us with\neffective means of causing JiuGe Technology to meet its obligations or recovering any losses or damages as a result of non-performance. Further, the legal\nenvironment in China is not as developed as in other jurisdictions. Uncertainties in the application of various laws, rules, regulations or policies in PRC\nlegal system could limit our liability to enforce the VIE Agreements and protect our interests.\nThe payment arrangement under the VIE Agreements may be challenged by the PRC tax authorities.\nWe generate our revenues through the payments we receive pursuant to the VIE Agreements. We could face adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax\nauthorities determine that the VIE Agreements were not entered into based on arm’s length negotiations. For example, PRC tax authorities may adjust our\nincome and expenses for PRC tax purposes which could result in our being subject to higher tax liability or cause other adverse financial consequences.\nShareholders of JiuGe Technology have potential conflicts of interest with our Company which may adversely affect our business.\nLi Li is the legal representative and general manager, and also a shareholder of JiuGe Technology. There could be conflicts that arise from time to time\nbetween our interests and the interests of Ms. Li. There could also be conflicts that arise between us and JiuGe Technology that would require our\nshareholders and JiuGe Technology’s shareholders to vote on corporate actions necessary to resolve the conflict. There can be no assurance in any such\ncircumstances that Ms. Li will vote her shares in our best interest or otherwise act in the best interests of our company. If Ms. Li fails to act in our best\ninterests, our operating performance and future growth could be adversely affected.\n56\nWe rely on the approval certificates and business license held by JiuGe Management and any deterioration of the relationship between JiuGe\nManagement and JiuGe Technology could materially and adversely affect our business operations.\nWe operate our mobile data business in China on the basis of the approval certificates, business license and other requisite licenses held by JiuGe\nManagement and JiuGe Technology. There is no assurance that JiuGe Management and JiuGe Technology will be able to renew their licenses or certificates\nwhen their terms expire with substantially similar terms as the ones they currently hold.\nFurther, our relationship with JiuGe Technology is governed by the VIE Agreements that are intended to provide us with effective control over the business\noperations of JiuGe Technology. However, the VIE Agreements may not be effective in providing control over the application for and maintenance of the\nlicenses required for our business operations. JiuGe Technology could violate the VIE Agreements, go bankrupt, suffer from difficulties in its business or\notherwise become unable to perform its obligations under the VIE Agreements and, as a result, our operations, reputations and business could be severely\nharmed.\nIf JiuGe Management exercises the purchase option it holds over JiuGe Technology’s share capital pursuant to the VIE Agreements, the payment of\nthe purchase price could materially and adversely affect our financial position.\nUnder the VIE Agreements, JiuGe Technology’s shareholders have granted JiuGe Management an option for the maximum period of time permitted by law\nto purchase all of the equity interest in JiuGe Technology at a price equal to one dollar or the lowest applicable price allowable by PRC laws and\nregulations. As JiuGe Technology is already our contractually controlled affiliate, JiuGe Management’s exercising of the option would not bring immediate\nbenefits to our company, and payment of the purchase prices could adversely affect our financial position.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nChanges in China’s political or economic situation could harm us and our operating results.\nEconomic reforms adopted by the Chinese government have had a positive effect on the economic development of the country, but the government could\nchange these economic reforms or any of the legal systems at any time. This could either benefit or damage our operations and profitability. Some of the\nthings that could have this effect are:\n● Level of government involvement in the economy;\n● Control of foreign exchange;\n● Methods of allocating resources;\n● Balance of payments position;\n● International trade restrictions; and\n● International conflict.\nThe Chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the\n“OECD”), in many ways. For example, state-owned enterprises still constitute a large portion of the Chinese economy and weak corporate governance and\na lack of flexible currency exchange policy still prevail in China. As a result of these differences, we may not develop in the same way or at the same rate\nas might be expected if the Chinese economy was similar to those of the OECD member countries.\n57\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiary and affiliate in the PRC. Our principal operating subsidiary and affiliate,\nJiuGe Management and JiuGe Technology, are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable\nto foreign-invested enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited\nprecedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign\ninvestments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not\nalways uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us. In\naddition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, most of\nour executive officers and all of our directors are not residents of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the\nUnited States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process in the United States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United\nStates against our Chinese operations, subsidiary and affiliate.\nThe current tensions in international trade and rising political tensions, particularly between the United States and China, may adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRecently there have been heightened tensions in international economic relations, such as the one between the United States and China. Political tensions\nbetween the United States and China have escalated due to, among other things, trade disputes, the COVID-19 outbreak, sanctions imposed by the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury on certain officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the PRC central government and the executive orders\nissued by the U.S. government in November 2020 that prohibit certain transactions with certain China-based companies and their respective subsidiaries.\nRising political tensions could reduce levels of trade, investments, technological exchanges, and other economic activities between the two major\neconomies. Such tensions between the United States and China, and any escalation thereof, may have a negative impact on the general, economic, political,\nand social conditions in China and, in turn, adversely impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regulations were introduced\nwhich includes but not limited to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law which states that overseas securities regulatory authorities shall not carry out an\ninvestigation and evidence collection activities directly in China without the consent of the securities regulatory authority of the State Council and the\nrelevant State Council department(s). It further defines that no organization or individual shall provide the documents and materials relating to securities\nbusiness activities to overseas parties arbitrarily. With this regulation in force, it may result in delays by the Company to fulfil any request to provide\nrelevant documents or materials by the regulatory authorities or in the worst-case scenario that the Company would not be able to fulfil the request if the\napproval from the regulatory authority of the State Council and the relevant State Council department(s) were rejected.\nYou may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nWe are a Delaware holding company, but Finger Motion (CN) Limited is a Hong Kong company, and our principal operating affiliate and subsidiary, JiuGe\nTechnology and JiuGe Management, are located in the PRC. Most of our assets are located outside the United States and most of our current operations are\nconducted in the PRC. In addition, all of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial\nportion of the assets of these persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the\nUnited States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments predicated on the civil liability provisions of the U.S.\nfederal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, all of whom are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose\nassets are located outside the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of\nU.S. courts. The recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. Courts in China may recognize\nand enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between China and the country\nwhere the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal\nrecognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will\nnot enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national\nsovereignty, security or the public interest. Therefore, it is uncertain whether a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United\nStates.\n58\nThe PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.\nThe PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and\nstate ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and\nexport tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance\nwith all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new,\nstricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance\nwith such regulations or interpretations.\nAccordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally\nplanned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in\nChina or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.\nThe PRC government may exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based\nissuers.\nRecent statements by the PRC government indicate an intent to take actions to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas\nand/or foreign investment in China-based issuers. On February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities\nOffering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the “Overseas Listing Trial Measures”) and five relevant guidelines, which became effective on March 31,\n2023. The Overseas Listing Trial Measures regulate both direct and indirect overseas offering and listing of PRC domestic companies’ securities by\nadopting a filing-based regulatory regime. According to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, if the issuer meets both the following conditions, the overseas\nsecurities offering and listing conducted by such issuer will be determined as indirect overseas offering, which shall be subject to the filing procedure set\nforth under the Overseas Listing Trial Measures: (i) 50% or more of the issuer’s operating revenue, total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in\nits audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent accounting year is accounted for by domestic companies; and (ii) the main parts of the\nissuer’s business activities are conducted in mainland China, or its main places of business are located in mainland China, or the senior managers in charge\nof its business operations and management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in mainland China. Where an abovementioned issuer submits an\napplication for an initial public offering to competent overseas regulators, such issuer shall file with the CSRC within three business days after such\napplication is submitted. Where a domestic company fails to fulfil filing procedure or in violation of the provisions as stipulated above, in respect of its\noverseas offering and listing, the CSRC shall order rectification, issue warnings to such domestic company, and impose a fine ranging from RMB1,000,000\nto RMB10,000,000. Also the directly liable persons and actual controllers of the domestic company that organize or instruct the aforementioned violations\nshall be warned and/or imposed fines.\nAlso on February 17, 2023, the CSRC also held a press conference for the release of the Overseas Listing Trial Measures and issued the Notice on\nAdministration for the Filing of Overseas Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, which, among others, clarifies that the domestic companies that\nhave already been listed overseas on or before the effective date of the Overseas Listing Trial Measures (March 31, 2023) shall be deemed as “stock\nenterprises”. Stock enterprises are not required to complete the filling procedures immediately, and they shall be required to file with the CSRC when\nsubsequent matters such as refinancing are involved.\nIf we offer new securities in the future, we will be required to file with the CSRC, which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer\nor continue to offer securities to investors and could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\n59\nFuture inflation in China may inhibit our ability to conduct business in China.\nIn recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. During the past ten years, the\nrate of inflation in China has been as high as 4.5% and as low as 0.2%. These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to\ntime, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future\ncause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and\nthereby harm the market for our products and our company.\nCapital outflow policies in the PRC may hamper our ability to remit income to the United States.\nThe PRC has adopted currency and capital transfer regulations. These regulations may require that we comply with complex regulations for the movement\nof capital and as a result we may not be able to remit all income earned and proceeds received in connection with our operations or from the sale of one of\nour operating subsidiaries to the U.S. or to our shareholders.\nAdverse regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review, and additional disclosure requirements and regulatory\nscrutiny to be adopted by the SEC in response to risks related to recent regulatory developments in China may impose additional compliance\nrequirements for companies like us with significant China-based operations, all of which could increase our compliance costs, subject us to additional\ndisclosure requirements.\nThe recent regulatory developments in China, in particular with respect to restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore, may lead to\nadditional regulatory review in China over our financing and capital raising activities in the United States. In addition, we may be subject to industry-wide\nregulations that may be adopted by the relevant PRC authorities, which may have the effect of limiting our service offerings, restricting the scope of our\noperations in China, or causing the suspension or termination of our business operations in China entirely, all of which will materially and adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. We may have to adjust, modify, or completely change our business operations in response to\nadverse regulatory changes or policy developments, and we cannot assure you that any remedial action adopted by us can be completed in a timely, cost-\nefficient, or liability-free manner or at all.\nOn July 30, 2021, in response to the recent regulatory developments in China and actions adopted by the PRC government, the Chairman of the SEC issued\na statement asking the SEC staff to seek additional disclosures from offshore issuers associated with China-based operating companies before their\nregistration statements will be declared effective. On August 1, 2021, the CSRC stated in a statement that it had taken note of the new disclosure\nrequirements announced by the SEC regarding the listings of Chinese companies and the recent regulatory development in China, and that both countries\nshould strengthen communications on regulating China-related issuers. We cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to tightened regulatory review and\nwe could be exposed to government interference in China.\nCompliance with China’s new Data Security Law, Measures on Cybersecurity Review (revised draft for public consultation), Personal Information\nProtection Law (second draft for consultation), regulations and guidelines relating to the multi-level protection scheme and any other future laws and\nregulations may entail significant expenses and could materially affect our business.\nChina has implemented or will implement rules and is considering a number of additional proposals relating to data protection. China’s new Data Security\nLaw promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China in June 2021, or the Data Security Law, took effect in September\n2021. The Data Security Law provides that the data processing activities must be conducted based on “data classification and hierarchical protection\nsystem” for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities in China from transferring data stored in China to foreign law enforcement agencies or\njudicial authorities without prior approval by the Chinese government. As a result of the new Data Security Law, we may need to make adjustments to our\ndata processing practices to comply with this law.\nAdditionally, China’s Cyber Security Law, requires companies to take certain organizational, technical and administrative measures and other necessary\nmeasures to ensure the security of their networks and data stored on their networks. Specifically, the Cyber Security Law provides that China adopt a multi-\nlevel protection scheme (MLPS), under which network operators are required to perform obligations of security protection to ensure that the network is free\nfrom interference, disruption or unauthorized access, and prevent network data from being disclosed, stolen or tampered. Under the MLPS, entities\noperating information systems must have a thorough assessment of the risks and the conditions of their information and network systems to determine the\nlevel to which the entity’s information and network systems belong-from the lowest Level 1 to the highest Level 5 pursuant to the Measures for the Graded\nProtection and the Guidelines for Grading of Classified Protection of Cyber Security. The grading result will determine the set of security protection\nobligations that entities must comply with. Entities classified as Level 2 or above should report the grade to the relevant government authority for\nexamination and approval.\n60\nRecently, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”) has taken action against several Chinese internet companies in connection with their initial\npublic offerings on U.S. securities exchanges, for alleged national security risks and improper collection and use of the personal information of Chinese\ndata subjects. According to the official announcement, the action was initiated based on the National Security Law, the Cyber Security Law and the\nMeasures on Cybersecurity Review, which are aimed at “preventing national data security risks, maintaining national security and safeguarding public\ninterests.” On July 10, 2021, the CAC published a revised draft of the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, expanding the cybersecurity review to data\nprocessing operators in possession of personal information of over 1 million users if the operators intend to list their securities in a foreign country.\nIt is unclear at the present time how widespread the cybersecurity review requirement and the enforcement action will be and what effect they will have on\nthe telecommunications sector generally and the Company in particular. China’s regulators may impose penalties for non-compliance ranging from fines or\nsuspension of operations, and this could lead to us delisting from the U.S. stock market.\nAlso, on November 20, 2021, the National People’s Congress passed the Personal Information Protection Law, which was implemented on November 1,\n2021. The law creates a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands\ndata protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in China, and the\nprocessing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or\nanalyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The law also proposes that critical information infrastructure operators and personal\ninformation processing entities who process personal information meeting a volume threshold to-be-set by Chinese cyberspace regulators are also required\nto store in China personal information generated or collected in China, and to pass a security assessment administered by Chinese cyberspace regulators for\nany export of such personal information. Lastly, the draft contains proposals for significant fines for serious violations of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of\nannual revenues from the prior year.\nInterpretation, application and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations evolve from time to time and their scope may continually change, through\nnew legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement. Compliance with the Cyber Security Law and the Data Security Law\ncould significantly increase the cost to us of providing our service offerings, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from\nproviding certain service offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may operate in the future. Despite our efforts to comply\nwith applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible that our practices,\nofferings or platform could fail to meet all of the requirements imposed on us by the Cyber Security Law, the Data Security Law and/or related\nimplementing regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with such law or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or\ninformation security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access, use or release of personally identifiable information or other data,\nor the perception or allegation that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and\nexisting counterparties from contracting with us or result in investigations, fines, suspension or other penalties by Chinese government authorities and\nprivate claims or litigation, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if our practices\nare not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the legal uncertainty created by the Data Security Law and the recent Chinese\ngovernment actions could materially adversely affect our ability, on favorable terms, to raise capital, including engaging in follow-on offerings of our\nsecurities in the U.S. market.\n61\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenues effectively.\nThe majority of our revenues will be settled in Chinese Renminbi (RMB), and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use\nrevenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the\nChinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still\nremain, including primarily the restriction that foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial\ndocuments, at those banks in China authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of RMB for capital account items, including\ndirect investment and loans, is subject to governmental approval in China, and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange\naccounts for capital account items. We cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the\nconvertibility of the RMB.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nThe value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB and between those currencies and\nother currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our\nfinancial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the\nexchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars as well as earnings from, and the value of,\nany U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future.\nSince July 2005, the RMB is no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People’s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market\nto prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in\nthe medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and\nlessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any\nhedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited,\nand we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange\ncontrol regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies.\nRestrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiary’s ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely affect our ability\nto grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, pay dividends to our shareholders, and otherwise fund and conduct our\nbusinesses.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is earned by JiuGe Management, our PRC subsidiary. PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiary to make\ndividends and other payments to its offshore parent company. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC subsidiary only out of its\naccumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC subsidiary is also required under\nPRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of our annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC GAAP to a statutory general reserve\nfund until the amounts in said fund reaches 50% of our registered capital. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific\npurposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to transfer\nfunds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay\ndividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nPRC regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional\ncapital contributions to our PRC subsidiary and affiliated entities, which could harm our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nAs an offshore holding company of our PRC subsidiary, we may (i) make loans to our PRC subsidiary and affiliated entities, (ii) make additional capital\ncontributions to our PRC subsidiary, (iii) establish new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, and (iv) acquire\noffshore entities with business operations in China in an offshore transaction. However, most of these uses are subject to PRC regulations and approvals.\nFor example:\n62\n● loans by us to our wholly-owned subsidiary in China, which is a foreign-invested enterprise, cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered\nwith the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC (the “SAFE”) or its local counterparts;\n● loans by us to our affiliated entities, which are domestic PRC entities, over a certain threshold must be approved by the relevant government\nauthorities and must also be registered with the SAFE or its local counterparts; and\n● capital contributions to our wholly-owned subsidiary must file a record with the PRC Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) or its local\ncounterparts and shall also be limited to the difference between the registered capital and the total investment amount.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or filings on a timely basis, or at all. If we fail to finish such\nregistrations or filings, our ability to capitalize our PRC subsidiary’s operations may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and\nour ability to fund and expand our business.\nOn March 30, 2015, the SAFE promulgated a notice relating to the administration of foreign invested company of its capital contribution in foreign\ncurrency into RMB (Hui Fa [2015]19) (“Circular 19”). Although Circular 19 has fastened the administration relating to the settlement of exchange of\nforeign-investment, allows the foreign-invested company to settle the exchange on a voluntary basis, it still requires that the bank review the authenticity\nand compliance of a foreign-invested company’s settlement of exchange in previous time, and the settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies shall\ndeposit on the foreign exchange settlement account, and shall not be used for several purposes as listed in the “negative list”. As a result, the notice may\nlimit our ability to transfer funds to our operations in China through our PRC subsidiary, which may affect our ability to expand our business. Meanwhile,\nthe foreign exchange policy is unpredictable in China, it shall be various with the nationwide economic pattern, the strict foreign exchange policy may have\nan adverse impact in our capital cash and may limit our business expansion.\nFailure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC\nresident shareholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiary or affiliate, limit our\nPRC subsidiary’s and affiliate’s ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us.\nIn October 2005, the SAFE, issued the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through Special\nPurpose Companies by Residents Inside China, generally referred to as Circular 75, which required PRC residents to register with the competent local\nSAFE branch before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special purpose company (“SPV”), for the purpose of engaging in an equity\nfinancing outside of China on the strength of domestic PRC assets originally held by those residents. Internal implementing guidelines issued by the SAFE,\nwhich became public in June 2007 (“Notice 106”), expanded the reach of Circular 75 by (1) purporting to cover the establishment or acquisition of control\nby PRC residents of offshore entities which merely acquire “control” over domestic companies or assets, even in the absence of legal ownership; (2) adding\nrequirements relating to the source of the PRC resident’s funds used to establish or acquire the offshore entity; covering the use of existing offshore entities\nfor offshore financings; (3) purporting to cover situations in which an offshore SPV establishes a new subsidiary in China or acquires an unrelated company\nor unrelated assets in China; and (4) making the domestic affiliate of the SPV responsible for the accuracy of certain documents which must be filed in\nconnection with any such registration, notably, the business plan which describes the overseas financing and the use of proceeds. Amendments to\nregistrations made under Circular 75 are required in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, mergers and acquisitions, equity\ninvestment or creation of any security interest in any assets located in China to guarantee offshore obligations and Notice 106 makes the offshore SPV\njointly responsible for these filings. In the case of an SPV which was established, and which acquired a related domestic company or assets, before the\nimplementation date of Circular 75, a retroactive SAFE registration was required to have been completed before March 30, 2006; this date was\nsubsequently extended indefinitely by Notice 106, which also required that the registrant establish that all foreign exchange transactions undertaken by the\nSPV and its affiliates were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the requirements of Circular 75, as applied by the\nSAFE in accordance with Notice 106, may result in fines and other penalties under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Any\nsuch failure could also result in the SPV’s affiliates being impeded or prevented from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in\ncapital, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, or from engaging in other transfers of funds into or out of China.\n63\nWe have advised our shareholders who are PRC residents, as defined in Circular 75, to register with the relevant branch of SAFE, as currently required, in\nconnection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions of equity interests in our PRC subsidiary and affiliate. However, we cannot provide any\nassurances that their existing registrations have fully complied with, and they have made all necessary amendments to their registration to fully comply\nwith, all applicable registrations or approvals required by Circular 75. Moreover, because of uncertainty over how Circular 75 will be interpreted and\nimplemented, and how or whether the SAFE will apply it to us, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For\nexample, our present and prospective PRC subsidiary’s and affiliate’s ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and\nforeign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Circular 75 by our PRC resident beneficial holders. In addition, such PRC\nresidents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by Circular 75. We also have little control over either our\npresent or prospective direct or indirect shareholders or the outcome of such registration procedures. A failure by our PRC resident beneficial holders or\nfuture PRC resident shareholders to comply with Circular 75, if the SAFE requires it, could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal\nsanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiary’s and affiliate’s ability to make distributions or pay dividends or\naffect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe may be subject to fines and legal sanctions by the SAFE or other PRC government authorities if we or our employees who are PRC citizens fail to\ncomply with PRC regulations relating to employee stock options granted by offshore listed companies to PRC citizens.\nOn March 28, 2007, the SAFE promulgated the Operating Procedures for Foreign Exchange Administration of Domestic Individuals Participating in\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plans and Stock Option Plans of Offshore Listed Companies (“Circular 78”). Under Circular 78, Chinese citizens who are\ngranted share options by an offshore listed company are required, through a Chinese agent or Chinese subsidiary of the offshore listed company, to register\nwith SAFE and complete certain other procedures, including applications for foreign exchange purchase quotas and opening special bank accounts. We and\nour Chinese employees who have been granted share options are subject to Circular 78. Failure to comply with these regulations may subject us or our\nChinese employees to fines and legal sanctions imposed by the SAFE or other PRC government authorities and may prevent us from further granting\noptions under our share incentive plans to our employees. Such events could adversely affect our business operations.\nUnder the New EIT Law, we may be classified as a “resident enterprise” of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax\nconsequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.\nUnder the New EIT Law effective on January 1, 2008, an enterprise established outside China with “de facto management bodies” within China is\nconsidered a “resident enterprise,” meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The\nimplementing rules of the New EIT Law define de facto management as “substantial and overall management and control over the production and\noperations, personnel, accounting, and properties” of the enterprise.\nOn April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment\nControlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies (the “Notice”), further\ninterpreting the application of the New EIT Law and its implementation non-Chinese enterprise or group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the\nNotice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a “non-domestically\nincorporated resident enterprise” if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial\nor personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops,\nboard and shareholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often resident in China. A\nresident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when\npaying dividends to its non-PRC shareholders. However, it remains unclear as to whether the Notice is applicable to an offshore enterprise incorporated by\na Chinese natural person. Nor are detailed measures on imposition of tax from non-domestically incorporated resident enterprises are available. Therefore,\nit is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case.\n64\nGiven the above conditions, although unlikely, we may be deemed to be a resident enterprise by Chinese tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities\ndetermine that we are a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First,\nwe may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting\nobligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as interest on financing proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to PRC\nenterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the New EIT Law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiary\nwould qualify as “tax-exempt income,” we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange\ncontrol authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that\nare treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new\n“resident enterprise” classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders\nand with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC shareholders from transferring our shares. We are actively monitoring the possibility of “resident\nenterprise” treatment.\nIf we were treated as a “resident enterprise” by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China, and our PRC tax may not\nbe creditable against our U.S. tax.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that\nwe violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political\nparties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third\nparties and we earn the majority of our revenue in China. PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Our activities in China create the risk\nof unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our executive officers, employees, consultants, sales agents or other representatives of our Company,\neven though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees.\nHowever, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the executive officers, employees, consultants,\nsales agents or other representatives of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese\nanti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business,\noperating results and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations\ncommitted by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nBecause our business is located in the PRC, we may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls, which we are\nrequired to do in order to comply with U.S. securities laws.\nPRC companies have historically not adopted a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong\ncorporate governance, internal controls and computer, financial and other control systems. Some of our staff is not educated and trained in the Western\nsystem, and we may have difficulty hiring new employees in the PRC with such training. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in\nestablishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records\nand instituting business practices that meet Western standards. Therefore, we may, in turn, experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining\nadequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the SOA. This may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal\ncontrols, which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with Commission rules and regulations and the\nrequirements of the SOA. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\n65\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public announcements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory\nbodies in the PRC. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that is located in the PRC,\nwhere part of our operations and business are located, has conducted any due diligence on our operations or reviewed or cleared any of our disclosure.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations\npromulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Unlike public reporting companies whose operations are located primarily in the\nUnited States, however, substantially all of our operations are located in the PRC and Hong Kong. Since substantially all of our operations and business\ntakes place outside of United States, it may be more difficult for the staff of the SEC to overcome the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present\nwhen reviewing our disclosure. These same obstacles are not present for similar companies whose operations or business take place entirely or primarily in\nthe United States. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other disclosure and public announcements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC\nregulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review of the CSRC. Accordingly, you should\nreview our SEC reports, filings and our other public announcements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on our\nCompany and with the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public announcements has been reviewed or otherwise\nbeen scrutinized by any local regulator.\nCertain PRC regulations, including those relating to mergers and acquisitions and national security, may require a complicated review and approval\nprocess which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nThe Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the “M&A Rules”), which became effective in September\n2006 and were further amended in June 2009, requires that if an overseas company is established or controlled by PRC domestic companies or citizens\nintends to acquire equity interests or assets of any other PRC domestic company affiliated with the PRC domestic companies or citizens, such acquisition\nmust be submitted to the MOFCOM, rather than local regulators, for approval. In addition, the M&A Rules requires that an overseas company controlled\ndirectly or indirectly by PRC companies or citizens and holding equity interests of PRC domestic companies needs to obtain the approval of the China\nSecurities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, prior to listing its securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published a\nnotice on its official website specifying the documents and materials required to be submitted by overseas special purpose companies seeking the CSRC’s\napproval of their overseas listings.\nThe M&A Rules established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors more\ntime-consuming and complex. For example, the MOFCOM must be notified in the event a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. In\naddition, certain acquisitions of domestic companies by offshore companies that are related to or affiliated with the same entities or individuals of the\ndomestic companies, are subject to approval by the MOFCOM. In addition, the Implementing Rules Concerning Security Review on Mergers and\nAcquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises, issued by the MOFCOM in November 2011, require that mergers and acquisitions by foreign\ninvestors in “any industry with national security concerns” be subject to national security review by the MOFCOM. In addition, any activities attempting to\ncircumvent such review process, including structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement, are strictly prohibited.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the interpretation and implementation of these regulations relating to merger and acquisition activities in China.\nIn addition, complying with these requirements could be time-consuming, and the required notification, review or approval process may materially delay or\naffect our ability to complete merger and acquisition transactions in China. As a result, our ability to seek growth through acquisitions may be materially\nand adversely affected. In addition, if the MOFCOM determines that we should have obtained its approval for our entry into contractual arrangements with\nour affiliated entities, we may be required to file for remedial approvals. There is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such approval from the\nMOFCOM.\n66\nIf the MOFCOM, the CSRC and/or other PRC regulatory agencies subsequently determine that the approvals from the MOFCOM and/or CSRC and/or\nother PRC regulatory agencies were required, our PRC business could be challenged, and we may need to apply for a remedial approval and may be subject\nto certain administrative punishments or other sanctions from PRC regulatory agencies. The regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our\noperations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the conversion and remittance of our funds in foreign currencies into the\nPRC, or take other actions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as\nwell as the trading price of our common stock.\nAs substantially all of our operations are conducted through the VIE in China, our ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on receiving\ndistributions of funds from the VIE. However, the PRC government might exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas\nand/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which would likely result in a material change in our operations, even significantly limit or\ncompletely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities or dividends to investors, and the value of our common stock may depreciate\nsignificantly or become worthless.\nOn July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued\nthe Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance with the Law (the “Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities\nOpinions”). The Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities\nactivities and the supervision over overseas listings by China-based companies, and proposed to take measures, including promoting the construction of\nrelevant regulatory systems to control the risks and deal with the incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies.\nIn addition, on December 24, 2021, the CSRC issued the draft Administration Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities\nOffering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the “Draft Administration Provisions”) and the draft Administrative Measures for the Filing of Overseas\nSecurities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the “Draft Administrative Measures”), for public comments. The Draft Administration\nProvisions and the Draft Administrative Measures regulate overseas securities offering and listing by domestic companies in direct or indirect form. The\nDraft Administration Provisions specify the responsibilities of the CSRC to regulate the activities of overseas securities offering and listing by domestic\ncompanies and establish a filing-based regime. As a supporting measure to the Draft Administration Provisions, the Draft Administrative Measures, detail\nthe determination criteria for indirect overseas listing in overseas markets. Specifically, an offering and listing shall be considered as an indirect overseas\noffering and listing by a domestic company if the issuer meets the following conditions: (i) the operating income, gross profit, total assets, or net assets of\nthe domestic enterprise in the most recent fiscal year was more than 50% of the relevant line item in the issuer’s audited consolidated financial statement\nfor that year; and (ii) senior management personnel responsible for business operations and management are mostly PRC citizens or are ordinarily resident\nin the PRC, or the main place of business is in the PRC or carried out in the PRC. In accordance with the Draft Administrative Measures, the issuer or its\ndesignated material domestic company, shall file with the CSRC and report the relevant information for its initial public offering.\nOn February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Overseas Listing Trial Measures and five relevant guidelines, which became effective on March 31,\n2023. The Overseas Listing Trial Measures regulate both direct and indirect overseas offering and listing of PRC domestic companies’ securities by\nadopting a filing-based regulatory regime. According to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, if the issuer meets both the following conditions, the overseas\nsecurities offering and listing conducted by such issuer will be determined as indirect overseas offering, which shall be subject to the filing procedure set\nforth under the Overseas Listing Trial Measures: (i) 50% or more of the issuer’s operating revenue, total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in\nits audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent accounting year is accounted for by domestic companies; and (ii) the main parts of the\nissuer’s business activities are conducted in mainland China, or its main places of business are located in mainland China, or the senior managers in charge\nof its business operations and management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in mainland China. Where an abovementioned issuer submits an\napplication for an initial public offering to competent overseas regulators, such issuer shall file with the CSRC within three business days after such\napplication is submitted. Where a domestic company fails to fulfil filing procedure or in violation of the provisions as stipulated above, in respect of its\noverseas offering and listing, the CSRC shall order rectification, issue warnings to such domestic company, and impose a fine ranging from RMB1,000,000\nto RMB10,000,000. Also the directly liable persons and actual controllers of the domestic company that organize or instruct the aforementioned violations\nshall be warned and/or imposed fines.\n67\nAlso on February 17, 2023, the CSRC also held a press conference for the release of the Overseas Listing Trial Measures and issued the Notice on\nAdministration for the Filing of Overseas Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, which, among others, clarifies that the domestic companies that\nhave already been listed overseas on or before the effective date of the Overseas Listing Trial Measures (March 31, 2023) shall be deemed as “stock\nenterprises”. Stock enterprises are not required to complete the filling procedures immediately, and they shall be required to file with the CSRC when\nsubsequent matters such as refinancing are involved.\nDue to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, we will be required to file with the CSRC with respect to an offering of new securities, which may subject us\nto additional compliance requirements in the future and we cannot assure you that we will be able to get the clearance from the CSRC for any offering of\nnew securities on a timely manner. Any failure of us to comply with the new Overseas Listing Trial Measures may significantly limit or completely hinder\nour ability to offer or continue to offer our securities, cause significant disruption to our business operations, and severely damage our reputation.\nFurthermore, it is uncertain when and whether we will be able to obtain permission or approval from the CSRC or the PRC government to offer securities\nto list on U.S. exchanges or the execution of a VIE Agreement in the future. However, our operations are conducted through the VIE in PRC, and our\nability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on receiving distributions of funds from the VIE, if we do not obtain or maintain any of the permissions or\napprovals which may be required in the future by the PRC government for the operation of the VIE or the execution of VIE Agreements, our operations\nand financial conditions could be adversely effected, even significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities or\ndividends to investors and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.\nAlthough the audit report included in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024 was prepared by an auditor who has been\nrecently inspected by the PCAOB, if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, we could be\ndelisted if we are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirements established by the HFCAA.\nAs a public company with securities listed on Nasdaq, we are required to have our financial statements audited by an independent registered public\naccounting firm registered with the PCAOB. A requirement of being registered with the PCAOB is that if requested by the SEC or PCAOB, such\naccounting firm is required to make its audits and related audit work papers be subject to regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable\nprofessional standards. Since our auditor is located in Hong Kong and PRC, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB has previously been unable to conduct\ninspections without the approval of the PRC authorities due to various state secrecy laws and the revised Securities Law, the PCAOB did not have free\naccess to inspect the work of our auditor. This lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in the PRC prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and\nquality control procedures of our auditor based in the PRC. As a result, the investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The\ninability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in the PRC makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms’ audit\nprocedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of the PRC that are subject to the PCAOB inspections.\nOn December 18, 2020, the HFCAA was enacted. In essence, the act requires the SEC to prohibit securities of any foreign companies from being listed on\nU.S. securities exchanges or traded “over-the-counter” if a company retains a foreign accounting firm that cannot be inspected by the PCAOB for three\nconsecutive years, beginning in 2021. Our independent registered public accounting firm is located in and organized under the laws of Hong Kong and the\nPRC, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the PRC authorities, and therefore our auditors are\nnot currently inspected by the PCAOB.\nOn March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final amendments, which will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, relating to\nthe implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the\nSEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and\nthat the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. Before any\nregistrant will be required to comply with the interim final amendments, the SEC must implement a process for identifying such registrants. Consistent\nwith the HFCAA, the amendments will require any identified registrant to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that the registrant is not owned or\ncontrolled by a government entity in that jurisdiction, and will also require, among other things, disclosure in the registrant’s annual report regarding the\naudit arrangements of, and government influence on, such registrant.\n68\nOn June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the AHFCAA which, if enacted, would decrease the number of non-inspection years from three years to two,\nthus reducing the time period before the Company’s securities may be delisted or prohibited from trading.\nOn November 5, 2021, the SEC approved PCAOB Rule 6100, Board Determination Under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountability Act, effective\nimmediately. The rule establishes “a framework for the PCAOB’s determinations under the HFCAA that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate\ncompletely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction.”\nOn December 2, 2021, SEC has announced the adoption of amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the\nHFCAA. The rules apply to registrants the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm\nthat is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate (“Commission-Identified Issuers”). The final amendments\nrequire Commission-Identified Issuers to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that, if true, it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity\nin the public accounting firm’s foreign jurisdiction. The amendments also require that a Commission-Identified Issuer that is a “foreign issuer,” as defined\nin Exchange Act Rule 3b-4, provide certain additional disclosures in its annual report for itself and any of its consolidated foreign operating entities.\nFurther, the adopting release provides notice regarding the procedures the SEC has established to identify issuers and to impose trading prohibitions on the\nsecurities of certain Commission-Identified Issuers, as required by the HFCAA. The SEC will identify Commission-Identified Issuers for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 18, 2020. A Commission-Identified Issuer will be required to comply with the submission and disclosure requirements in the\nannual report for each year in which it was identified. If a registrant is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer based on its annual report for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2021, the registrant will be required to comply with the submission or disclosure requirements in its annual report filing covering\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nOn December 16, 2021, PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public\naccounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of the PRC, because of positions taken by PRC\nauthorities in those jurisdictions. The PCAOB made these determinations pursuant to PCAOB Rule 6100, which provides a framework for how the\nPCAOB fulfils its responsibilities under the HFCAA. The report further listed in its Appendix A and Appendix B, Registered Public Accounting Firms\nSubject to the Mainland China Determination and Registered Public Accounting Firms Subject to the Hong Kong Determination, respectively. The audit\nreport included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, was issued by Centurion ZD CPA & Co., an audit\nfirm headquartered in Hong Kong, a jurisdiction that the PCAOB previously determined that the PCAOB is unable to conduct inspections or investigate\nauditors. However, on December 15, 2022, the PCAOB determined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate\nregistered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and voted to vacate its previous determinations. Should the PRC\nauthorities obstruct or otherwise fail to facilitate the PCAOB’s access in the future, the PCAOB will consider the need to issue a new determination.\nIn June 2022, we were identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer on the SEC’s “Conclusive list of issuers identified under the HFCAA” (available\nat https://www.sec.gov/hfcaa), however, on September 10, 2024 we changed our auditor to CT International LLP based in San Francisco, CA, and, as a\nresult, we do not expect to be required to comply with the submission or disclosure requirements in our annual report covering the fiscal year ended\nFebruary 28, 2025. As noted above, on December 15, 2022, the PCAOB vacated its previous determinations that it is unable to inspect and investigate\ncompletely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong.\n69\nUnder the HFCAA (as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023), our securities may be prohibited from trading on the U.S. stock exchanges\nor in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. if our auditor is not inspected by the PCAOB for two consecutive years, and this ultimately could result\nin our common stock being delisted. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the AHFCAA, which was enacted under the Consolidated Appropriations\nAct, 2023, as further described below.\nOn August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of the\nPRC, taking the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland\nChina and Hong Kong. The Statement of Protocol gives the PCAOB sole discretion to select the firms, audit engagements and potential violations it\ninspects and investigates and put in place procedures for PCAOB inspectors and investigators to view complete audit work papers with all information\nincluded and for the PCAOB to retain information as needed. In addition, the Statement of Protocol grants the PCAOB direct access to interview and take\ntestimony from all personnel associated with the audits the PCAOB inspects or investigates. While significant, the Statement of Protocol is only a first step.\nUncertainties still exist as to whether and how this new Statement of Protocol will be implemented. Notwithstanding the signing of the Statement of\nProtocol, if the PCAOB cannot make a determination that it is able to inspect and investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered\nin mainland China and Hong Kong, trading of our securities will still be prohibited under the HFCAA and Nasdaq will determine to delist our securities.\nTherefore, there is no assurance that the Statement of Protocol will relieve us from the delisting risk under the HFCAA.\nOn December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, was signed into law, which amended the HFCAA (i) to reduce the number of\nconsecutive years that would trigger delisting from three years to two years, and (ii) so that any foreign jurisdiction could be the reason why the PCAOB\ndoes not to have complete access to inspect or investigate a company’s auditors. As it was originally enacted, the HFCAA applied only if the PCAOB’s\ninability to inspect or investigate because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction where the relevant public accounting firm is located.\nAs a result of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, the HFCAA now also applies if the PCAOB’s inability to inspect or investigate the relevant\naccounting firm is due to a position taken by an authority in any foreign jurisdiction. The denying jurisdiction does not need to be where the accounting\nfirm is located.\nThe SEC may propose additional rules or guidance that could impact us if our auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspection. For example, on November 6,\n2020, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets issued the Report on Protecting United States Investors from Significant Risks from Chinese\nCompanies to the then President of the United States. This report recommended that the SEC implement five recommendations to address companies from\njurisdictions that do not provide the PCAOB with sufficient access to fulfil its statutory mandate. Some of the concepts of these recommendations were\nimplemented with the enactment of the HFCAA. However, some of the recommendations were more stringent than the HFCAA. For example, if a\ncompany was not subject to PCAOB inspection, the report recommended that the transition period before a company would be delisted would end on\nJanuary 1, 2022.\nThe enactment of the HFCAA and the implications of any additional rulemaking efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information in PRC\ncould cause investor uncertainty for affected SEC registrants, including us, and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely\naffected. Additionally, whether the PCAOB will be able to conduct inspections of our auditor in the next two years, or at all, is subject to substantial\nuncertainty and depends on a number of factors out of our control. If we are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time, our stock will not\nbe permitted for trading on Nasdaq Capital Market either. Such a delisting would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our stock when you\nwish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our stock. Also, such a delisting would\nsignificantly affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition and prospects.\n70\nITEM 2 – UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nOn October 11, 2024, we issued an aggregate of 1,095,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1.50 per share to 15 individuals due to the closing of our\nprivate placement at $1.50 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,642,500. We relied upon the exemption from registration under the United States\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), provided by Rule 903 of Regulation S promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act for the\nissuance of the shares to the 15 individuals who were non-U.S. persons as the securities were issued to the individuals through offshore transactions where\nwere negotiated and consummated outside the United States.\nIn connection with the closing of the private placement, we paid cash finder’s fees of an aggregate of $158,000 to three individuals.\nITEM 3 – DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone\nITEM 4 – MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable\nITEM 5 – OTHER INFORMATION\nOn July 18, 2024, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Finger Motion Company Limited (the “Borrower”), entered into a loan agreement (the “Loan\nAgreement”) with Dr. Liew Yow Ming (the “Lender”) whereby the Lender agreed to advance a short-term loan facility of SGD$1,500,000 (the “Loan”)\nto the Borrower for working capital purposes. As of the date hereof, the full amount of the Loan has been drawn upon by the Borrower. Each drawdown\nportion of the Loan is due one (1) year from the date of the drawdown, unless extended by the Lender. If the Lender agrees, the Borrower may prepay the\nwhole or any part of the Loan by providing the Lender not less than three (3) business days prior written notice and subject to payment of interest accrued\nthereon. Any prepayment of the Loan shall be in an amount of SGD$50,000 or multiples thereof. The Loan shall bear interest at the rate of 1.50% per\nmonth, any such interest to accrue from day to day and to be calculated based on a 365-day year, and is payable on a monthly basis on or before the last day\nof each successive month. The Loan Agreement contains undertakings and covenants of the Borrower whereby the Borrower shall not, without the prior\nwritten consent of the Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) (i) effect any form or reconstruction or amalgamation by way of a\nscheme of arrangement or otherwise nor approve, permit or suffer any substantial change of ownership or transfer of any substantial part of its issued\ncapital, (ii) make any loan or advance or extend credit to any person or entity or issue or enter into any guidance or indemnity or otherwise become directly,\nindirectly or contingently liable for the obligations of any other person or entity except in the ordinary course of business, (iii) sell, lease, license alienate,\ntransfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the whole or any part of the undertaking, property or assets whatsoever and wheresoever situate present or future of\nthe Borrower except in the ordinary course of business, or (iv) amend or alter any provisions in its Memorandum or Articles of Association or such other\nequivalent constitutional documents to change its objects, borrowing or charging powers in such a manner so as to adversely affect the ability of the\nBorrower to perform or comply with any one or more of its obligations under the Loan Agreement.\nThe foregoing description of the Loan Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Loan\nAgreement, which is filed Exhibit 10.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and incorporated by reference herein.\nDuring our fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2024, none of our directors or executive officers adopted, modified or terminated any contract, instruction or\nwritten plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement” as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K.\n71\nITEM 6 – EXHIBITS\nThe following exhibits are included with this Quarterly Report:\nExhibit Description of Exhibit\n10.1(*)(†) Loan Agreement between Finger Motion Company Limited and Dr. Liew Yow Ming, dated July 18, 2024.\n31.1(*) Certification of Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a).\n31.2(*) Certification of Chief Financial Officer pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a).\n32.1(**) Certifications pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-14(b) or 15d-14(b) and 18 U.S.C.
