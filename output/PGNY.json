Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nNovember 12, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/11831/pdf)\n\nSales Season Yields Over 80 New Clients, 1.1 Million New Covered LivesSelected by a Leading National Health Plan and a Regional Health Plan as Their Preferred Partner1.5 Million Lives Adopt Newest Services in Maternity and/or Menopause Programs in 2025\n\nNEW YORK, Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Progyny, Inc. (Nasdaq: PGNY) (“Progyny” or the “Company”), a transformative fertility, family building and women's health benefits solution, today announced its financial results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 (“the third quarter of 2024”) as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 (“the third quarter of 2023” or “the prior year period”).\n\n“The utilization rate in the third quarter was consistent with the expectations we outlined in August. However, the members that began their journey utilized their benefits in a manner inconsistent with long-term patterns, taking longer to progress through their treatment and, therefore, consuming fewer treatments overall, resulting in lower-than-expected revenue and profitability this quarter,” said Pete Anevski, Chief Executive Officer of Progyny.\n\n“Even though our recent results relative to expectations have been disappointing to us, the business remains fundamentally very strong, and the success of our most recent selling season further validates our leading position in a large, growing and increasingly impactful market,” continued Anevski. “For the fourth consecutive year, our new sales season produced more than a million new covered lives across a broadly diverse set of company sizes and industries, further demonstrating the universal relevance of fertility, family building and women's health services to all types of employers.\n\n“We're extremely pleased with the advancement of our health plan strategy with the addition of a leading national and a regional health plan as their preferred partner next year. We're also encouraged with the reception for our newest services in maternity and menopause, with clients representing more than 1.5 million lives adopting one or more of these programs in 2025. We believe these wins highlight the significant differentiation of our solution as compared to other alternatives in the market with respect to member experience, demonstrated clinical success, and cost efficiency.”\n\n“We have continued to generate strong cash flow and have returned value to our shareholders through the repurchase of more than 12.3 million shares to date under the buyback programs that began earlier this year,” said Mark Livingston, Progyny’s Chief Financial Officer.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights:**\n\n(unaudited; in thousands, except per share amounts)| **3Q 2024**| **3Q 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nRevenue| $286,625| $280,891  \nGross Profit| $59,244| $62,624  \n _Gross Margin_|  _20.7_|  _%_| _22.3_|  _%_  \nNet Income| $10,421| $15,898  \nNet Income per Diluted Share1 | $0.11| $0.16  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share2| $0.40| $0.38  \nAdjusted EBITDA2| $46,478| $50,019  \n _Adjusted EBITDA Margin_ _2_|  _16.2_|  _%_| _17.8_|  _%_  \n  \n  1. Net income per diluted share reflects weighted-average shares outstanding as adjusted for potential dilutive securities, including options, restricted stock units, warrants to purchase common stock, and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan.\n  2. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Please see Annex A of this press release for a reconciliation of Adjusted earnings per diluted share to earnings per share, and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures stated in accordance with GAAP for each of the periods presented. We calculate Adjusted earnings per diluted share as net income per diluted share excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, adjusted for the impact of taxes. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\nRevenue was $286.6 million, a 2.0% increase as compared to the $280.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of the increase in our number of clients and covered lives. As previously announced, a large client notified Progyny that it would not be renewing its services agreement in 2025. Excluding the contribution of that one client in both periods, third quarter revenue increased 3.4%.\n\n  * Fertility benefit services revenue was $178.8 million, a 2.1% increase from the $175.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Pharmacy benefit services revenue was $107.9 million, a 2.0% increase as compared to the $105.8 million reported in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\nGross profit was $59.2 million, a decrease of 5.4% from the $62.6 million reported in the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin was 20.7%, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 22.3% reported in the prior year period primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs in the delivery of our care management services, in conjunction with the impact of the unanticipated decline in cycles per unique utilizer in the quarter.\n\nNet income was $10.4 million, or $0.11 income per diluted share, as compared to the $15.9 million, or $0.16 income per diluted share, reported in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net income was due primarily to the lower gross margin and higher provision for income taxes in the current period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $46.5 million, a decrease of 7.1% as compared to the $50.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting the lower gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.2%, a 160 basis point decrease from the 17.8% Adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter of 2023. Please refer to Annex A for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income.\n\n**Cash Flow** Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter of 2024 was $44.5 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $54.2 million in the prior year period. The lower cash flow as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to the previously disclosed impacts of certain favorable working capital items to the prior year period, as well as higher cash payments for income taxes in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Financial Position** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total working capital of approximately $337.8 million and no debt. This included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $235.7 million, a decrease of $26.5 million from the balances as of June 30, 2024, reflecting the stock repurchase activity conducted during the quarter and partially offset by cash flow from operations.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company purchased 2,817,190 shares for $61.4 million through its share repurchase programs. To date, the Company has purchased 12,382,193 shares collectively in the program and has used all of its existing authorizations.\n\n**Key Metrics**\n\nThe Company had 468 clients as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 392 clients as of September 30, 2023.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nART Cycles *| 14,911| 15,005| 45,275| 42,947  \nUtilization - All Members**| 0.54| %| 0.56| %| 1.10| %| 1.11| %  \nUtilization - Female Only**| 0.47| %| 0.49| %| 0.90| %| 0.93| %  \nAverage Members***| 6,444,000| 5,428,000| 6,381,000| 5,366,000  \n  \n* Represents the number of ART cycles performed, including IVF with a fresh embryo transfer, IVF freeze all cycles/embryo banking, frozen embryo transfers, and egg freezing.** Represents the member utilization rate for all services, including, but not limited to, ART cycles, initial consultations, IUIs, and genetic testing. The utilization rate for all members includes all unique members (female and male) who utilize the benefit during that period, while the utilization rate for female only includes only unique females who utilize the benefit during that period. For purposes of calculating utilization rates in any given period, the results reflect the number of unique members utilizing the benefit for that period. Individual periods cannot be combined as member treatments may span multiple periods.***Includes approximately 300,000 members from a single client not reflected in utilization as a result of the client's chosen benefit design.\n\n**Financial Outlook** The substantial majority of the clients added in the most recent selling season are expected to go live in the first quarter of 2025, though a number of clients have already or will launch their benefit in 2024. Once all new clients are live in 2025, the Company anticipates having more than 530 clients, representing approximately 6.7 million covered lives.\n\n“As the fourth quarter has begun, the rate of utilization remains healthy and we're seeing members consume more treatments as compared to the third quarter. Nonetheless, given the unexpected variability we've seen this year, we believe the prudent approach is to guide with the expectation this variability continues. Accordingly, we are revising our expectations for the balance of the year,” said Mr. Anevski.\n\n“As it relates to 2025, consistent with our past practice, we expect to provide financial guidance when we report our year-end results in February, by which time we'll have insights into our newest clients who are launching on January 1st. Despite the previously-reported loss of a large client, the business remains healthy and we expect to continue generating strong profitability and meaningful cash flow in 2025.”\n\nThe Company is providing the following financial guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2024 and the three-month period ending December 31, 2024:\n\n  * Full Year 2024 Outlook: \n    * Revenue is now projected to be $1.135 billion to $1.150 billion, reflecting growth of 4% to 6%\n    * Net income is projected to be $49.9 million to $53.3 million, or $0.52 to $0.56 per diluted share, on the basis of approximately 96 million assumed weighted-average fully diluted-shares outstanding\n    * Adjusted EBITDA1 is projected to be $189.0 million to $194.0 million\n    * Adjusted earnings per diluted share1 is projected to be $1.54 to $1.57\n  * Fourth Quarter of 2024 Outlook: \n    * Revenue is projected to be $266.2 million to $281.2 million, reflecting growth of (1)% to 4%\n    * Net income is projected to be $6.1 million to $9.5 million, or $0.07 to $0.10 per diluted share, on the basis of approximately 91 million assumed weighted-average fully diluted-shares outstanding\n    * Adjusted EBITDA1 is projected to be $37.8 million to $42.8 million\n    * Adjusted earnings per diluted share1 is projected to be $0.31 to $0.35\n\n\n  1. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted earnings per diluted share are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Please see Annex A of this press release for a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to forward-looking net income and Adjusted net income to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures stated in accordance with GAAP, for the period presented.\n\n\n\n**_Conference Call Information_** Progyny will host a conference call at 4:45 P.M.

For a detailed discussion of these and other risk factors, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and subsequent reports that we file with the SEC, which are available at _http://investors.progyny.com_ and on the SEC’s website at _https://www.sec.gov_.\n\nForward-looking statements represent our management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. Our actual future results could differ materially from what we expect. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_** In addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), this press release and the accompanying tables include the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share are supplemental financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial results, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share are helpful to our investors as they are measures used by management in assessing the health of our business, determining incentive compensation, evaluating our operating performance, and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share include: (1) it does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future; (2) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures; (3) it does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense; (4) it does not reflect other non-operating income and expenses, including interest and other income, net; (5) it does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we calculate these measures, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income, gross margin, and our other GAAP results.\n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; interest and other income, net; and provision for income taxes. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue as incremental Adjusted EBITDA in 2024 divided by incremental revenue in 2024. We calculate Adjusted earnings per diluted share as net income per diluted share excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, adjusted for the associated impact of taxes. Please see Annex A: “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” elsewhere in this press release.\n\n**_For Further Information, Please Contact:_**  \n---  \nInvestors:| Media:  \nJames

Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nNovember 12, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/11831/pdf)\n\nSales Season Yields Over 80 New Clients, 1.1 Million New Covered LivesSelected by a Leading National Health Plan and a Regional Health Plan as Their Preferred Partner1.5 Million Lives Adopt Newest Services in Maternity and/or Menopause Programs in 2025\n\nNEW YORK, Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Progyny, Inc. (Nasdaq: PGNY) (“Progyny” or the “Company”), a transformative fertility, family building and women's health benefits solution, today announced its financial results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 (“the third quarter of 2024”) as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 (“the third quarter of 2023” or “the prior year period”).\n\n“The utilization rate in the third quarter was consistent with the expectations we outlined in August. However, the members that began their journey utilized their benefits in a manner inconsistent with long-term patterns, taking longer to progress through their treatment and, therefore, consuming fewer treatments overall, resulting in lower-than-expected revenue and profitability this quarter,” said Pete Anevski, Chief Executive Officer of Progyny.\n\n“Even though our recent results relative to expectations have been disappointing to us, the business remains fundamentally very strong, and the success of our most recent selling season further validates our leading position in a large, growing and increasingly impactful market,” continued Anevski. “For the fourth consecutive year, our new sales season produced more than a million new covered lives across a broadly diverse set of company sizes and industries, further demonstrating the universal relevance of fertility, family building and women's health services to all types of employers.\n\n“We're extremely pleased with the advancement of our health plan strategy with the addition of a leading national and a regional health plan as their preferred partner next year. We're also encouraged with the reception for our newest services in maternity and menopause, with clients representing more than 1.5 million lives adopting one or more of these programs in 2025. We believe these wins highlight the significant differentiation of our solution as compared to other alternatives in the market with respect to member experience, demonstrated clinical success, and cost efficiency.”\n\n“We have continued to generate strong cash flow and have returned value to our shareholders through the repurchase of more than 12.3 million shares to date under the buyback programs that began earlier this year,” said Mark Livingston, Progyny’s Chief Financial Officer.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights:**\n\n(unaudited; in thousands, except per share amounts)| **3Q 2024**| **3Q 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nRevenue| $286,625| $280,891  \nGross Profit| $59,244| $62,624  \n _Gross Margin_|  _20.7_|  _%_| _22.3_|  _%_  \nNet Income| $10,421| $15,898  \nNet Income per Diluted Share1 | $0.11| $0.16  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share2| $0.40| $0.38  \nAdjusted EBITDA2| $46,478| $50,019  \n _Adjusted EBITDA Margin_ _2_|  _16.2_|  _%_| _17.8_|  _%_  \n  \n  1. Net income per diluted share reflects weighted-average shares outstanding as adjusted for potential dilutive securities, including options, restricted stock units, warrants to purchase common stock, and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan.\n  2. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Please see Annex A of this press release for a reconciliation of Adjusted earnings per diluted share to earnings per share, and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures stated in accordance with GAAP for each of the periods presented. We calculate Adjusted earnings per diluted share as net income per diluted share excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, adjusted for the impact of taxes. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\nRevenue was $286.6 million, a 2.0% increase as compared to the $280.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of the increase in our number of clients and covered lives. As previously announced, a large client notified Progyny that it would not be renewing its services agreement in 2025. Excluding the contribution of that one client in both periods, third quarter revenue increased 3.4%.\n\n  * Fertility benefit services revenue was $178.8 million, a 2.1% increase from the $175.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Pharmacy benefit services revenue was $107.9 million, a 2.0% increase as compared to the $105.8 million reported in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\nGross profit was $59.2 million, a decrease of 5.4% from the $62.6 million reported in the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin was 20.7%, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 22.3% reported in the prior year period primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs in the delivery of our care management services, in conjunction with the impact of the unanticipated decline in cycles per unique utilizer in the quarter.\n\nNet income was $10.4 million, or $0.11 income per diluted share, as compared to the $15.9 million, or $0.16 income per diluted share, reported in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net income was due primarily to the lower gross margin and higher provision for income taxes in the current period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $46.5 million, a decrease of 7.1% as compared to the $50.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting the lower gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.2%, a 160 basis point decrease from the 17.8% Adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter of 2023. Please refer to Annex A for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income.\n\n**Cash Flow** Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter of 2024 was $44.5 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $54.2 million in the prior year period. The lower cash flow as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to the previously disclosed impacts of certain favorable working capital items to the prior year period, as well as higher cash payments for income taxes in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Financial Position** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total working capital of approximately $337.8 million and no debt. This included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $235.7 million, a decrease of $26.5 million from the balances as of June 30, 2024, reflecting the stock repurchase activity conducted during the quarter and partially offset by cash flow from operations.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company purchased 2,817,190 shares for $61.4 million through its share repurchase programs. To date, the Company has purchased 12,382,193 shares collectively in the program and has used all of its existing authorizations.\n\n**Key Metrics**\n\nThe Company had 468 clients as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 392 clients as of September 30, 2023.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nART Cycles *| 14,911| 15,005| 45,275| 42,947  \nUtilization - All Members**| 0.54| %| 0.56| %| 1.10| %| 1.11| %  \nUtilization - Female Only**| 0.47| %| 0.49| %| 0.90| %| 0.93| %  \nAverage Members***| 6,444,000| 5,428,000| 6,381,000| 5,366,000  \n  \n* Represents the number of ART cycles performed, including IVF with a fresh embryo transfer, IVF freeze all cycles/embryo banking, frozen embryo transfers, and egg freezing.** Represents the member utilization rate for all services, including, but not limited to, ART cycles, initial consultations, IUIs, and genetic testing. The utilization rate for all members includes all unique members (female and male) who utilize the benefit during that period, while the utilization rate for female only includes only unique females who utilize the benefit during that period. For purposes of calculating utilization rates in any given period, the results reflect the number of unique members utilizing the benefit for that period. Individual periods cannot be combined as member treatments may span multiple periods.***Includes approximately 300,000 members from a single client not reflected in utilization as a result of the client's chosen benefit design.\n\n**Financial Outlook** The substantial majority of the clients added in the most recent selling season are expected to go live in the first quarter of 2025, though a number of clients have already or will launch their benefit in 2024. Once all new clients are live in 2025, the Company anticipates having more than 530 clients, representing approximately 6.7 million covered lives.\n\n“As the fourth quarter has begun, the rate of utilization remains healthy and we're seeing members consume more treatments as compared to the third quarter. Nonetheless, given the unexpected variability we've seen this year, we believe the prudent approach is to guide with the expectation this variability continues. Accordingly, we are revising our expectations for the balance of the year,” said Mr. Anevski.\n\n“As it relates to 2025, consistent with our past practice, we expect to provide financial guidance when we report our year-end results in February, by which time we'll have insights into our newest clients who are launching on January 1st. Despite the previously-reported loss of a large client, the business remains healthy and we expect to continue generating strong profitability and meaningful cash flow in 2025.”\n\nThe Company is providing the following financial guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2024 and the three-month period ending December 31, 2024:\n\n  * Full Year 2024 Outlook: \n    * Revenue is now projected to be $1.135 billion to $1.150 billion, reflecting growth of 4% to 6%\n    * Net income is projected to be $49.9 million to $53.3 million, or $0.52 to $0.56 per diluted share, on the basis of approximately 96 million assumed weighted-average fully diluted-shares outstanding\n    * Adjusted EBITDA1 is projected to be $189.0 million to $194.0 million\n    * Adjusted earnings per diluted share1 is projected to be $1.54 to $1.57\n  * Fourth Quarter of 2024 Outlook: \n    * Revenue is projected to be $266.2 million to $281.2 million, reflecting growth of (1)% to 4%\n    * Net income is projected to be $6.1 million to $9.5 million, or $0.07 to $0.10 per diluted share, on the basis of approximately 91 million assumed weighted-average fully diluted-shares outstanding\n    * Adjusted EBITDA1 is projected to be $37.8 million to $42.8 million\n    * Adjusted earnings per diluted share1 is projected to be $0.31 to $0.35\n\n\n  1. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted earnings per diluted share are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Please see Annex A of this press release for a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to forward-looking net income and Adjusted net income to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures stated in accordance with GAAP, for the period presented.\n\n\n\n**_Conference Call Information_** Progyny will host a conference call at 4:45 P.M.

Our actual future results could differ materially from what we expect. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_** In addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), this press release and the accompanying tables include the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share are supplemental financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial results, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share are helpful to our investors as they are measures used by management in assessing the health of our business, determining incentive compensation, evaluating our operating performance, and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share include: (1) it does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future; (2) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures; (3) it does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense; (4) it does not reflect other non-operating income and expenses, including interest and other income, net; (5) it does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we calculate these measures, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue and Adjusted earnings per share alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income, gross margin, and our other GAAP results.\n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; interest and other income, net; and provision for income taxes. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue as incremental Adjusted EBITDA in 2024 divided by incremental revenue in 2024. We calculate Adjusted earnings per diluted share as net income per diluted share excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, adjusted for the associated impact of taxes. Please see Annex A: “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” elsewhere in this press release.\n\n**_For Further Information, Please Contact:_**  \n---  \nInvestors:| Media:  \nJames
